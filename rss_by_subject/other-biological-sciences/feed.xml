Lee</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Methylothon is an inquiry-based high school learning module in microbial ecology, molecular biology, and bioinformatics that centers around pink-pigmented plant-associated methylotrophic bacteria. Here we present an overview of the module’s learning goals, describe course resources (available for public use on &lt;ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://methylothon.com"&gt;http://methylothon.com&lt;/ext-link&gt;), and relate lessons learned from adapting Methylothon for remote learning during the pandemic in spring of 2021. The original in-person version of the module allows students to isolate their own strains of methylotrophic bacteria from plants they sample from the environment, to identify these using PCR, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis, and to contribute their strains to original research in a university lab. The adapted version strengthens the focus on bioinformatics and increases its flexibility and accessibility by making the lab portion optional and adopting free web-based tools. Student feedback and graded assignments from Spring 2021 revealed that the lesson was especially effective at introducing the concepts of BLAST and phylogenetic trees, and that students valued and felt inspired by the opportunity to conduct hands-on work and to participate in community science.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.08.459370" rel="alternate" title="Methylothon: a versatile course-based high school research experience in microbiology and bioinformatics-- with pink bacteria (20 tweets)"/><category term="Scientific Communication and Education"/><published>2021-09-09T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.07.459250</id><title>GPCR-G protein selectivity – a unified meta-analysis (8 tweets)</title><updated>2021-09-13T07:44:08.160846+00:00</updated><author><name>Alexander S.

Gloriam</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Two-thirds of human hormones and one-third of clinical drugs act on membrane receptors that couple to G proteins to achieve appropriate functional responses. While G protein transducers from literature are annotated in the Guide to Pharmacology database, two recent large-scale datasets now expand the receptor-G protein ‘couplome’. However, these three datasets differ in scope and reported G protein couplings giving different coverage and conclusions on GPCR-G protein signaling. Here, we report a meta-analysis unifying GPCR-G protein coupling, by standardized normalization and consensus support, into a common coupling map. This unravels novel consensus couplings for receptors supported by two independent sources and insights on coupling selectivity of GPCRs and classification of co-coupling G proteins. The coupling protocol, map and selectivity resources will promote advances in receptor research and cellular signaling towards the exploitation of G protein signaling specificity in design of safer drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.07.459250" rel="alternate" title="GPCR-G protein selectivity – a unified meta-analysis (8 tweets)"/><category term="Pharmacology and Toxicology"/><published>2021-09-08T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry></feed>
