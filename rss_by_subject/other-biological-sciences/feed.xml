Artino</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field of medical education remains poorly delineated such that there is no broad consensus of the articles and journals that comprise “the field.” This lack of consensus has implications for conducting bibliometric studies and other research designs (e.g., systematic reviews); it also challenges the field to compare citation scores in the field and across others and for an individual to identify themselves as “a medical education researcher.” Other fields have utilized bibliometric field delineation, which is the assigning of articles or journals to a certain field in an effort to define that field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Process&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;italic&gt;Research Approach&lt;/italic&gt;, three bibliometric field delineation approaches -- information retrieval, core journals, and journal co-citation -- are introduced. For each approach, the authors describe their attempt to apply it in the medical education context and identify related strengths and weaknesses. Based on co-citation, the authors propose the Medical Education Journal List 24 (MEJ-24), as a starting point for delineating medical education and invite the community to collaborate on improving and potentially expanding this list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Pearls&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a research approach, field delineation is complicated, and there is no clear best way to delineate the field of medical education. However, recent advances in information and computer science provide potentially more fruitful approaches to deal with the complexity of the field. When considering these emerging approaches, researchers should consider collaborating with bibliometricians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bibliometric approaches rely on available metadata for articles and journals, which necessitates that researchers examine the metadata prior to analysis to understand its strengths and weaknesses, and to assess how this might affect their data interpretation. While using bibliometric approaches for field delineation is valuable, it is important to remember that these techniques are only as good as the research team’s interpretation of the data, which suggests that an expanded research approach is needed to better delineate medical education, an approach that includes active discussion within the medical education community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.453492" rel="alternate" title="Delineating Medical Education: Bibliometric Research Approach(es) (57 tweets)"/><category term="Scientific Communication and Education"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.22.453458</id><title>Epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity determines estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer dormancy and reacquisition of an epithelial state drives awakening (46 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.824101+00:00</updated><author><name>Patrick Aouad</name></author><author><name>Yueyun Zhang</name></author><author><name>Céline Stibolt</name></author><author><name>Sendurai A.

The mechanisms governing tumor cell dormancy and latent disease remain elusive due to a lack of adequate models. Here, we compare tumor progression of ER+ and triple-negative (TN) BC subtypes with a clinically relevant mouse intraductal xenografting approach (MIND). Both ER+ and TN BC cells disseminate already during the &lt;italic&gt;in situ&lt;/italic&gt;stage. However, TN disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) proliferate at the same rate as cells at the primary site and give rise to macro-metastases. ER+ DTCs have low proliferative indices, form only micro-metastases and lose epithelial characteristics. Expression of &lt;italic&gt;CDH1&lt;/italic&gt; is decreased whereas the mesenchymal marker &lt;italic&gt;VIM&lt;/italic&gt; and the transcription factors, &lt;italic&gt;ZEB1&lt;/italic&gt;/&lt;italic&gt;ZEB2,&lt;/italic&gt; which control epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) are increased. EMP is not detected earlier during ER+ BC development and not required for invasion or metastasis. &lt;italic&gt;In vivo&lt;/italic&gt;, forced transition to the epithelial state through ectopic E-cadherin expression overcomes dormancy with increased growth of lung metastases. We conclude that EMP is essential for the generation of a dormant cell state and the development of latent disease. Targeting exit from EMP is of therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.22.453458" rel="alternate" title="Epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity determines estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer dormancy and reacquisition of an epithelial state drives awakening (46 tweets)"/><category term="Cancer Biology"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.30.454514</id><title>Length Biases in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing of pre-mRNA (44 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.824285+00:00</updated><author><name>Gennady Gorin</name></author><author><name>Lior Pachter</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Single-molecule pre-mRNA and mRNA sequencing data can be modeled and analyzed using the Markov chain formalism to yield genome-wide insights into transcription.

In addition, cells need to adapt to their mechanical environment through mechanosensitive pathways. How mechanical cues influence cell behaviors during morphogenesis, however, remains poorly understood. Here we studied the influence of mechanical forces during the formation of the atrioventricular canal (AVC) where cardiac valves develop. We show that in zebrafish the AVC forms within a zone of tissue convergence between the atrium and the ventricle which is associated with increased activation of the actomyosin meshwork and endocardial cell orientation changes. We demonstrate that tissue convergence occurs with a major reduction of endocardial cell volume triggered by mechanical forces and the mechanosensitive channels TRPP2/TRPV4. In addition, we show that the extracellular matrix component hyaluronic acid controls cell volume changes. Together, our data suggest that cell volume change is a key cellular feature activated by mechanical forces during cardiovascular morphogenesis. This work further unravels how mechanical forces and
extracellular matrix can influence tissue remodeling in developing organs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.27.453460" rel="alternate" title="Extracellular mechanical forces drive endocardial cell volume decrease during cardiac valve morphogenesis (29 tweets)"/><category term="Developmental Biology"/><published>2021-07-27T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.453816</id><title>Synaptic Mechanisms of Top-Down Control by The Auditory Cortico-Collicular Pathway (23 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.824696+00:00</updated><author><name>Hannah M.

These “descending” pathways enable the neocortex to control ascending sensory representations in a predictive or feedback manner, but the underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we combine optogenetic approaches with &lt;italic&gt;in vivo&lt;/italic&gt; and &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt; patch-clamp electrophysiology to study the projection from auditory cortex to the inferior colliculus (IC), a major descending auditory pathway that controls IC neuron feature selectivity, plasticity and auditory perceptual learning. Although individual auditory cortico-collicular synapses were generally weak, IC neurons often integrated inputs from multiple corticofugal axons that generated reliable, tonic depolarizations even during prolonged presynaptic activity. Latency measurements &lt;italic&gt;in vivo&lt;/italic&gt; showed that descending signals reach the IC within 30 ms of sound onset, which in IC neurons corresponded to the peak of synaptic depolarizations evoked by short sounds. Activating ascending and descending pathways at latencies expected &lt;italic&gt;in vivo&lt;/italic&gt; caused a NMDA receptor dependent, supra-linear EPSP summation, indicating that descending signals can non-linearly amplify IC neurons’ moment-to-moment acoustic responses. Our results shed light upon the synaptic bases of descending sensory control, and imply that heterosynaptic cooperativity contributes to the auditory cortico-collicular pathway’s role in plasticity and perceptual learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.453816" rel="alternate" title="Synaptic Mechanisms of Top-Down Control by The Auditory Cortico-Collicular Pathway (23 tweets)"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.453647</id><title>Oncogenic c-Myc induces replication stress by increasing cohesins chromatin occupancy (21 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.824889+00:00</updated><author><name>Silvia Peripolli</name></author><author><name>Tanya Singh</name></author><author><name>Harshil Patel</name></author><author><name>Leticia Meneguello</name></author><author><name>Koshiro Kiso</name></author><author><name>Peter Thorpe</name></author><author><name>Cosetta Bertoli</name></author><author><name>Robertus A.M. de Bruin</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Oncogene-induced replication stress is a major driver of genomic instability in cancer cells, with a central role in both cancer initiation and progression (1). Despite its critical role in cancer development, the mechanisms that lay at the basis of oncogene-induced replication stress remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the mechanism of c-Myc-induced replication stress. Our data shows that c-Myc induces replication stress by increasing the amount of cohesins bound to chromatin in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This is independent of previously suggested mechanisms involving deregulation of replication initiation and transcriptional interference. Restoring the amount of chromatin-bound cohesins to control levels, or preventing the accumulation of cohesins at CTCF sites, in cells experiencing oncogenic c-Myc activity prevents replication stress. Increased cohesins chromatin occupancy correlates with a c-Myc-dependent increase in the levels of the cohesion loader Mau2. Preventing c-Myc-induced increase in Mau2 reduces oncogene-induced replication stress. Together our data support a novel mechanism for oncogene-induced replication stress. Since c-Myc activation is a crucial event in many human cancers (2), identifying the mechanisms through which this oncogene promotes replication stress provides critical insights into cancer biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.453647" rel="alternate" title="Oncogenic c-Myc induces replication stress by increasing cohesins chromatin occupancy (21 tweets)"/><category term="Cancer Biology"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.453678</id><title>Reward-dependent selection of feedback gains impacts rapid motor decisions (16 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.825202+00:00</updated><author><name>Antoine De Comite</name></author><author><name>Frédéric Crevecoeur</name></author><author><name>Philippe Lefèvre</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Expected reward is known to affect planning strategies through modulation of movement vigor. Strikingly, although current theories suggest that movement planning consists in selecting a goal-directed control policy, the influence of reward on feedback control strategies remains unknown. Here we investigated this question in three human reaching experiments. First, we varied the explicit reward associated with the goal target and found an overall increase in movement vigor for higher reward targets, highlighted by larger velocities, feedback responses to external loads, and background muscle activity. Then, assuming that larger feedback gains were used to reject perturbations, we sought to investigate whether this effect hindered online decisions to switch to a new target in the presence of multiple successful goals. We indeed observed idiosyncratic switching strategies dependent on both target rewards and movement vigor, such that the more vigorous movements were less likely to switch to a new goal following perturbations. To gain further insight into a causal influence of movement vigor on rapid motor decisions, we demonstrated that biasing the baseline activity and reflex gains by means of a background load evoked a larger proportion of target switches in the direction opposite to the background load associated with lower muscle activity. Our results highlight the competition between movement vigor and flexibility to switch target during movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Significance statement&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans can modulate their movement vigor based on the expected reward. However, a potential influence of reward on feedback control has not been documented. Here we investigated reaching control strategies in different contexts associated with explicit rewards for one or multiple goals, while exposed to external perturbations. We report two strategies: reward could either invigorate feedback gains, or promote flexible switches between goals. The engagement of peripheral circuits in the modulation of feedback gains was confirmed by the application of a background load that biased feedback vigor directionally, which evoked differences in switching behavior in the opposite direction. We conclude that feedback vigor and flexible changes in goal are two competing mechanisms to be selected when one interacts with a dynamic environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.453678" rel="alternate" title="Reward-dependent selection of feedback gains impacts rapid motor decisions (16 tweets)"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.21260947</id><title>Prospective validation of host transcriptomic biomarkers for pulmonary tuberculosis by real-time PCR (16 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.825374+00:00</updated><author><name>Simon C.

Eight signatures were measured by microfluidic RT-qPCR and participants were microbiologically-investigated for pulmonary TB at baseline, and actively surveilled for incident disease through 15 months. Diagnostic AUCs for 61 HIV-uninfected (weighted-prevalence 1.1%) and 10 HIV-infected (prevalence 1.2%) prevalent TB cases for the 8 signatures were 0.63–0.79 and 0.65–0.88, respectively.

Interestingly, aging is also associated with changes in executive function, including decision-making abilities, but it remains unclear how age-related changes in both domains interact to impact financial decisions involving other people. To study this problem, we recruited 50 human participants (N&lt;sub&gt;younger&lt;/sub&gt; = 26, ages 18-34; N&lt;sub&gt;older&lt;/sub&gt; = 24, ages 63-80) to play an economic trust game as the investor with three partners (friend, stranger, and computer) who played the role of investee. Investors underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the trust game while investees were seated outside of the scanner. Building on our previous work with younger adults showing both enhanced striatal responses and altered default-mode network (DMN) connectivity as a function of social closeness during reciprocated trust, we predicted that these relations would exhibit age-related differences. We found that striatal responses to reciprocated trust from friends relative to strangers and computers were blunted in older adults relative to younger adults, thus supporting our primary pre-registered hypothesis regarding social closeness. We also found that older adults exhibited enhanced DMN connectivity with the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) during reciprocated trust from friends compared to computers while younger adults exhibited the opposite pattern. Taken together, these results advance our understanding of age-related differences in sensitivity to social closeness in the context of trusting others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Significance&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our social relationships change as we grow older. Despite the ubiquity of these changes, little is known about how they impact our neural and behavioral responses to financial decisions involving other people. We examined this problem in the context of a trust game played with three partners varying in social closeness (friend, stranger, computer) while participants underwent fMRI. We found both blunted striatal activation and enhanced DMN-TPJ connectivity to reciprocated trust from friends relative to strangers and computers in older compared to younger adults. These results suggest that older adults demonstrate altered representations of social closeness within financial exchanges involving trust, which may expose older adults to increased risk for financial exploitation perpetrated by strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.29.454071" rel="alternate" title="Age-Related Differences in Ventral Striatal and Default Mode Network Function During Reciprocated Trust (15 tweets)"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><published>2021-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.453674</id><title>Role of non-specific interactions in the phase-separation and maturation of macromolecules (14 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.825817+00:00</updated><author><name>Rakesh Krishnan</name></author><author><name>Srivastav Ranganathan</name></author><author><name>Samir K Maji</name></author><author><name>Ranjith Padinhateeri</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Phase separation of biomolecules could be mediated by both specific and non-specific interactions. How the interplay between non-specific and specific interactions along with polymer entropy influences phase separation is an open question. We address this question by simulating self-associating molecules as polymer chains with a short core stretch that forms the specifically interacting functional interface, and longer non-core regions that participate in non-specific/promiscuous interactions. Our results show that the interplay of specific (strength, &lt;italic&gt;ϵ&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;) and non-specific interactions (strength, &lt;italic&gt;ϵ&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ns&lt;/sub&gt;) could result in phase separation of polymers and its transition to solid-like aggregates (mature state). In the absence of &lt;italic&gt;ϵ&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ns&lt;/sub&gt;, the polymer chains do not dwell long enough in the vicinity of each other to undergo phase separation and transition into a mature state. On the other hand, in the limit of strong &lt;italic&gt;ϵ&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ns&lt;/sub&gt;, the assemblies cannot transition into the mature state because they get kinetically trapped, suggesting an optimal range of interactions favoring mature multimers. In the scenario where only a fraction (N&lt;sub&gt;frac&lt;/sub&gt;) of the non-core regions participate in attractive interactions, we find that a slight modifications to either &lt;italic&gt;ϵ&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ns&lt;/sub&gt; or N&lt;sub&gt;frac&lt;/sub&gt; can result in a dramatically altered self-assembled states. Using a combination of heterogeneous and homogeneous mix of polymers, we establish how this interplay between interaction energies dictates the propensity of biomolecules to find the correct binding partner at dilute concentrations in crowded environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.453674" rel="alternate" title="Role of non-specific interactions in the phase-separation and maturation of macromolecules (14 tweets)"/><category term="Biophysics"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.24.453634</id><title>Crowding-induced phase separation of nuclear transport receptors in FG nucleoporin assemblies (14 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.825979+00:00</updated><author><name>Luke K.

Hoogenboom</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The rapid (&amp;lt; 1 ms) transport of biological material to and from the cell nucleus is regulated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC). At the core of the NPC is a permeability barrier consisting of intrinsically disordered Phe-Gly (FG) nucleoporins (FG Nups). Various types of nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) facilitate transport by partitioning in the FG Nup assembly, overcoming the barrier by their affinity to the FG Nups, and comprise a significant fraction of proteins in the NPC barrier. In previous work, we revealed that the experimental binding of the NTRs NTF2 and – the larger – Imp&lt;italic&gt;β&lt;/italic&gt; to different planar assemblies of FG Nups follows a universal physical law defined by negative cooperativity, which was further validated by a minimal physical model that treated the FG Nups as flexible homopolymers and the NTRs as uniformly cohesive spheres &lt;bold&gt;&lt;italic&gt;Zahn et al. (2016&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;/bold&gt;). Here, we build upon our original study by first parametrizing our model to experimental data, and next to predict the effects of crowding by different types of NTRs. We show how varying the amounts of one type of NTR modulates how the other NTR penetrates the FG Nup assembly. Notably, at similar and physiologically relevant NTR concentrations, our model predicts demixed phases of NTF2 and Imp&lt;italic&gt;β&lt;/italic&gt; within the FG Nup assembly. The functional implication of NTR phase separation is that NPCs may sustain separate transport pathways that are determined by inter-NTR competition.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.24.453634" rel="alternate" title="Crowding-induced phase separation of nuclear transport receptors in FG nucleoporin assemblies (14 tweets)"/><category term="Biophysics"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.28.454097</id><title>Integrative analysis of the salt stress response in cyanobacteria (12 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.826190+00:00</updated><author><name>Stephan Klaehn</name></author><author><name>Stefan Mikkat</name></author><author><name>Matthias Riediger</name></author><author><name>Jens Georg</name></author><author><name>Wolfgang R Hess</name></author><author><name>Martin Hagemann</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Microorganisms evolved specific acclimation strategies to thrive in environments of high or fluctuating salinities.

The massive accumulation of glucosylglycerol then had a measurable impact on the overall carbon and nitrogen metabolism. In addition, we observed the coordinated induction of putative regulatory RNAs and of several proteins known for their involvement in other stress responses. Overall, salt-induced changes in the proteome and transcriptome showed good correlations, especially among the stably up-regulated proteins and their transcripts.

Increased discounting has been linked to various psychiatric conditions, including substance-use-disorders, behavioral addictions and obesity. Despite its high intra-individual stability, temporal discounting is partly under contextual control. One prominent manipulation that has been linked to increases in discounting is the exposure to highly arousing appetitive cues. However, results from trial-wise cue exposure studies appear highly mixed, and changes in physiological arousal were not adequately controlled. Here we tested the effects of appetitive (erotic), aversive and neutral visual cues on temporal discounting in thirty-five healthy male participants. The contribution of single-trial physiological arousal was assessed using comprehensive monitoring of autonomic activity (pupil size, heart rate, electrodermal activity). Physiological arousal was elevated following aversive and in particular erotic cues. In contrast to our pre-registered hypothesis, if anything, we observed &lt;italic&gt;decreased&lt;/italic&gt; temporal discounting following erotic cue exposure. Aversive cues tended to increase decision noise. Computational modeling revealed that trial-wise arousal only accounted for minor variance over and above aversive and erotic condition effects, arguing against a general effect of physiological arousal on temporal discounting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.24.452477" rel="alternate" title="Trial-wise exposure to visual appetitive cues increases physiological arousal but not temporal discounting (11 tweets)"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.28.454213</id><title>Mitochondria dysfunction in Charcot Marie Tooth 2B Peripheral Sensory Neuropathy (11 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.826545+00:00</updated><author><name>Yingli Gu</name></author><author><name>Flora Guerra</name></author><author><name>Mingzheng Hu</name></author><author><name>Alexander Pope</name></author><author><name>Kijung Sung</name></author><author><name>Wanlin Yang</name></author><author><name>Simone Jetha</name></author><author><name>Thomas A.

In contrast to recently published results from studies of using heterologous overexpression systems, our results have demonstrated significant mitochondrial fragmentation in fibroblasts of both human CMT2B patients and CMT2B mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Furthermore, we have shown that mitochondria were fragmented and axonal mitochondrial movement was dysregulated in primary cultured E18 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, but not in E18 hippocampal and cortical primary neurons. We also show that inhibitors to either the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 or to the nucleotide binding to Rab7 normalized the mitochondrial deficits in both MEFs and E18 cultured DRG neurons. Our study has revealed, for the first time, that expression of CMT2B Rab7 mutation at physiological level enhances Drp1 activity to promote mitochondrial fission, that may potentially underlie selective vulnerability of peripheral sensory neurons in CMT2B pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.28.454213" rel="alternate" title="Mitochondria dysfunction in Charcot Marie Tooth 2B Peripheral Sensory Neuropathy (11 tweets)"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><published>2021-07-28T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.30.454065</id><title>Subcellular and regional localization of mRNA translation in midbrain dopamine neurons (9 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.826783+00:00</updated><author><name>Benjamin D Hobson</name></author><author><name>Linghao Kong</name></author><author><name>Maria Florencia Angelo</name></author><author><name>Ori J Lieberman</name></author><author><name>Eugene V Mosharov</name></author><author><name>Etienne Herzog</name></author><author><name>David Sulzer</name></author><author><name>Peter A Sims</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Local translation within excitatory and inhibitory neurons is involved in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. Despite the extensive dendritic and axonal arborizations of central monoaminergic neurons, the subcellular localization of protein synthesis is not well-characterized in these populations. Here, we investigated mRNA localization and translation in midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons, cells with enormous axonal and dendritic projections, both of which exhibit stimulation-evoked dopamine (DA) release. Using highly-sensitive ribosome-bound RNA-sequencing and imaging approaches in mDA axons, we found no evidence for axonal mRNA localization or translation. In contrast, mDA neuronal dendritic projections into the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) contain ribosomes and mRNAs encoding the major components of DA synthesis, release, and reuptake machinery. Surprisingly, we also observed dendritic localization of mRNAs encoding synaptic vesicle-related proteins, including those involved in vesicular exocytic fusion. Our results are consistent with a role for local translation in the regulation of DA release from dendrites, but not from axons. Our translatome data further defined a molecular signature of the sparse mDA neurons resident in the SNr, including enrichment of Atp2a3/SERCA3, an ER calcium pump previously undescribed in mDA neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.30.454065" rel="alternate" title="Subcellular and regional localization of mRNA translation in midbrain dopamine neurons (9 tweets)"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><published>2021-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.453271</id><title>Understanding associative false memories in aging using multivariate analyses (9 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.826966+00:00</updated><author><name>Nancy A.

Studies have shown that there is a benefit to associative memory if the configural context of associative pairs is maintained from encoding to retrieval. The current study aimed to examine whether this benefit of contextual congruency is reduced in aging, and whether the neural similarity of memory representations between targets and lures underlies age- related increases in false memories. Behaviorally, both age groups benefited from target pairs presented in a visual format that was congruent with how the pair was learned. While no age difference was observed in hits, the typical age-related increase in false alarms was found. Congruent with behavioral results, neither the relationship between target-related patterns of neural activity across memory phases (as measured by ERS) nor the discriminability of target classification as a function of condition at retrieval (as measured by MVPA). However, with regard to false memories, older adults exhibited overall lower pattern similarity for hits and FAs compared to hits and CRs (as measured by RSA). Additionally, Hit-FA RSA correlated with age- related increases in associative FAs across visual, frontal, and parietal cortices. Results suggest that while neural processes supporting associative memory retrieval are dependent on configural congruency between encoding and retrieval, there is no difference as to how congruency affects these processes in aging. Additionally, similarity of target and lure processing may reflect reduced diagnosticity of information processing in aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.453271" rel="alternate" title="Understanding associative false memories in aging using multivariate analyses (9 tweets)"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.453355</id><title>Inhibition of striatal SEZ6 by miR-3594-5p is a drug-specific marker for late-stage heroin intake escalation (9 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.827125+00:00</updated><author><name>Magalie Lenoir</name></author><author><name>Isabella Bondi</name></author><author><name>Loïc Clemenceau</name></author><author><name>Isabelle Nondier</name></author><author><name>Margaux Ballé</name></author><author><name>Sébastien Jacques</name></author><author><name>Angéline Duché</name></author><author><name>Corinne Canestrelli</name></author><author><name>Séverine Martin-Lannerée</name></author><author><name>Sophie Mouillet-Richard</name></author><author><name>Jenny M.

Gruber</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Consistent with the idea that curiosity enhances information seeking, it has been shown that activity within both the dopaminergic circuit and hippocampus supports curiosity-enhanced learning. However, the role of whole-brain mechanisms involved in cognitive control (fronto-parietal network; FPN) and memory integration (default mode network; DMN) that might underpin curiosity states and their effects on memory remain elusive. We hypothesised that the FPN and DMN should distinguish between high- and low-curiosity conditions and be recruited more heavily for later remembered information associated with high-curiosity. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging whilst participants completed a trivia paradigm, in which we presented trivia questions associated with high- and low-curiosity, followed by the associated answer. After a short delay, we tested memory for trivia answers. We adopted a network-based parcellation of the brain into subnetworks of the FPN and DMN to examine how neural activity within, and functional connectivity between, each subnetwork predicts curiosity-enhanced memory. Across elicitation and relief of curiosity, we found focal recruitment of FPNA and widespread recruitment of DMN subnetworks in support of curiosity and curiosity-enhanced memory. Most importantly, during the elicitation of curiosity, functional subcortical connectivity and across cortical networks, but not subcortical-cortical coupling, correlated with curiosity-enhanced memory. However, during the relief of curiosity, coupling between subcortical regions and DMNA emerged in support of curiosity-enhanced memory. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence about how neuromodulatory mechanisms via the hippocampal-dopaminergic circuit trigger states of curiosity and thereby communicate to higher-order cortical regions to facilitate curiosity-enhanced memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Significant statement&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does neural activity within, and functional connectivity between, the dopaminergic-hippocampal network, fronto-parietal network (FPN), and default mode network (DMN) underpin curiosity states and their effects on memory? Here, we show how the dopaminergic system together with the hippocampus interact specifically with subnetwork DMNA potentially reflecting how subcortical regions support the enhancement of memory intergration of semantic information associated with curiosity. As DMNA (the core DMN subnetwork) was also functionally coupled with the whole DMN network and the semantic control network (FPNA), these findings provide a plausible neuromodulatory mechanism through which hippocampal-dopaminergic input triggers curiosity and then communicates to higher-order brain regions via DMNA to facilitate curiosity-enhanced memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.453739" rel="alternate" title="Connectivity between the hippocampus and default mode network during the relief – but not elicitation – of curiosity supports curiosity-enhanced memory enhancements (8 tweets)"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.24.453449</id><title>Heat-inactivated modified vaccinia virus Ankara boosts Th1-biased cellular and humoral immune responses as a vaccine adjuvant by activating the STING-mediated cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway (8 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.827502+00:00</updated><author><name>Ning Yang</name></author><author><name>Aitor Garzia</name></author><author><name>Cindy Meyer</name></author><author><name>Thomas Tuschl</name></author><author><name>Taha Merghoub</name></author><author><name>Jedd D.

However, one primary concern regarding subunit vaccines is the relatively weak immune responses induced by proteins or peptides. Therefore, developing novel and effective vaccine adjuvants is critical for the success of subunit vaccines. Modified vaccinia virus (MVA) is a safe and effective vaccine against smallpox and monkeypox. In this study, we explored the potential of heat-inactivated MVA (heat-iMVA) as a novel vaccine adjuvant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We co-administered heat-iMVA with a model antigen, chicken ovalbumin (OVA), either intramuscularly or subcutaneously twice, two weeks apart, and analyzed anti-OVA specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in the spleens and skin draining lymph nodes (dLNs) and serum anti-OVA IgG1 and IgG2c antibodies. We also compared the adjuvanticity of heat-iMVA with several known vaccine adjuvants, including complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) and AddaVax, an MF59-like preclinical grade nano-emulsion. In addition, we tested whether co-administration of heat-iMVA plus tumor neoantigen peptides or irradiated tumor cells improves antitumor efficacy in a B16-F10 therapeutic vaccination model. Using Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) or Batf3-deficient mice, we evaluated the contribution of the STING pathway and Batf3-dependent CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD8α DCs in heat-iMVA-induced immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-administration of protein- or peptide-based immunogens with heat-iMVA dramatically enhances Th1-biased cellular and humoral immune responses. This adjuvant effect of heat-iMVA is dependent on the STING-mediated cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, and the antigen-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell response requires Batf3-dependent CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD8α&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dendritic cells (DCs). Heat-iMVA infection of bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) promoted antigen cross-presentation, whereas live MVA infection did not. RNA-seq analyses revealed that heat-iMVA is a more potent activator of the STING pathway than live MVA. Additionally, combining tumor neoantigen peptides or irradiated tumor cells with heat-iMVA delayed tumor growth and extended the median survival in B16-F10 therapeutic vaccination models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat-iMVA induces type I interferon (IFN) production and antigen cross-presentation via a STING-dependent mechanism in DCs. Co-administration of heat-iMVA with peptide antigen generates strong Th1-biased cellular and humoral immunity.

The mapping of local correlation to individual atoms, and its use to draw insights on local signal variations are discussed.

Multisensory information is used to stabilize the visual scene on the retina via the vestibulo-ocular (VOR) and optokinetic (OKR) reflexes. While the organization of neuronal circuits underlying VOR is well described across vertebrates, less is known about the contribution and evolutionary origin of the OKR circuits. Moreover, the integration of these two sensory modalities is still poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel experimental model, the isolated lamprey eye-brain-labyrinth preparation, to analyze the neuronal pathways underlying visuo-vestibular integration which allowed electrophysiological recordings while applying vestibular stimulation using a moving platform, coordinated with visual stimulation via two screens. We show that lampreys exhibit robust visuo-vestibular integration, with optokinetic information processed in the pretectum and integrated with vestibular inputs at several subcortical levels. The enhanced eye movement response to multimodal stimulation favored the vestibular response at increased velocities. The optokinetic signals can be downregulated from tectum. Additionally, saccades are present in the form of nystagmus. The lamprey represents the oldest living group of vertebrates, thus all basic components of the visuo-vestibular control of gaze were present already at the dawn of vertebrate evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.30.454479" rel="alternate" title="Visuo-vestibular gaze control - conserved subcortical processing (6 tweets)"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><published>2021-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.452189</id><title>The first crested duck genome reveals clues to genetic compensation and crest cushion formation (6 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.828241+00:00</updated><author><name>Guobin Chang</name></author><author><name>Xiaoya Yuan</name></author><author><name>Qixin Guo</name></author><author><name>Hao Bai</name></author><author><name>Xiaofang Cao</name></author><author><name>Meng Liu</name></author><author><name>Zhixiu Wang</name></author><author><name>Bichun Li</name></author><author><name>Shasha Wang</name></author><author><name>Yong Jiang</name></author><author><name>Zhiquan Wang</name></author><author><name>Yang Zhang</name></author><author><name>Qi Xu</name></author><author><name>Qianqian Song</name></author><author><name>Rui Pan</name></author><author><name>Shenghan Zheng</name></author><author><name>Lingling Qiu</name></author><author><name>Tiantian Gu</name></author><author><name>Xinsheng Wu</name></author><author><name>Yulin Bi</name></author><author><name>Zhengfeng Cao</name></author><author><name>Yu Zhang</name></author><author><name>Yang Chen</name></author><author><name>Hong Li</name></author><author><name>Jianfeng Liu</name></author><author><name>Wangcheng Dai</name></author><author><name>Guohong Chen</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The Chinese crested (CC) duck is a unique indigenous waterfowl breed with a phenotypic crest trait that affects its high survival rate. Therefore, the CC duck is an ideal model to investigate the genetic compensation response to maintain genetic stability. In the present study, we first generated a chromosome-level genome of CC ducks. Comparative genomics revealed genes related to tissue repair, immune function, and tumors were under strong positive selection, which suggested that these adaptive changes might enhance cancer resistance and immune response to maintain the genetic stability of CC ducks. We sub-assembled a Chinese spot-billed duck genome and detected genome-assembled structure variants among three ducks. Functional analysis revealed that a large number of structural variants were related to the immune system, which strongly suggests the occurrence of genetic compensation in the anti-tumor and immune systems to further support the survival of CC ducks. Moreover, we confirmed that the CC duck originated from the mallard ducks. Finally, we revealed the physiological and genetic basis of crest traits and identified a causative mutation in &lt;italic&gt;TAS2R40&lt;/italic&gt; that leads to crest formation.

The findings were replicated in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS, n=2,886) and DILGOM 2007 (n=3,905). Together, these three cohorts had 1070 cases of incident type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;76 eicosanoids were associated individually with incident type 2 diabetes. We identified three eicosanoids independently associated with incident type 2 diabetes using stepwise Cox regression with forward selection and a Bonferroni-corrected inclusion threshold. A three-eicosanoid risk score produced a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.56 (95% confidence interval 1.41-1.72) per one standard deviation (SD) increment for risk of incident diabetes. The HR for comparing the top quartile to the lowest was 2.80 (2.53-3.07). Meta-analysis of the three cohorts yielded a pooled HR per SD of 1.31 (1.05-1.56).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plasma eicosanoid profiles predict incident type 2 diabetes and the clearest signals replicate in three independent cohorts. Our findings give new information on the biology underlying type 2 diabetes and suggest opportunities for early identification of people at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.21260986" rel="alternate" title="A plasma metabolite score of three eicosanoids predicts incident type 2 diabetes – a prospective study in three independent cohorts (6 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.453293</id><title>Age- and sex-related topological organisation of human brain functional networks and their relationship to cognition (6 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.829149+00:00</updated><author><name>Heidi Foo</name></author><author><name>Anbupalam Thalamuthu</name></author><author><name>Jiyang Jiang</name></author><author><name>Forrest Koch</name></author><author><name>Karen A.

We explored this question further by examining differences in 11 resting-state graph theory measures with respect to age, sex, and their relationships with cognitive performance in 17,127 UK Biobank participants (mean=62.83±7.41 years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;METHODS&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain connectivity toolbox was used to derive the graph theory measures that assessed network integration, segregation, and strength. Multiple linear regression was performed the relationship between age, sex, cognition, and network measures. Subsequently, multivariate analysis was done to further examine the joint effect of the network measures on cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;RESULTS&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age was associated with an overall decrease in the effectiveness of network communication (i.e. integration) and loss of functional specialisation (i.e. segregation) of specific brain regions. Sex differences were also observed, with women showing more efficient networks which were less segregated than in men (FDR adjusted &lt;italic&gt;p&lt;/italic&gt;&amp;lt;.05). Age-related changes were also more apparent in men than women, which suggests that men may be more vulnerable to cognitive decline with age. Interestingly, while network segregation and strength of limbic network were only nominally associated with cognitive performance, the network measures collectively were significantly associated with cognition (FDR adjusted &lt;italic&gt;p&lt;/italic&gt;≤.002). This may imply that individual measures may be inadequate to capture much of the variance in neural activity or its output and need further refinement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complexity of the functional brain organisation may be shaped by an individual’s age and sex, which ultimately may influence cognitive performance of older adults.

This includes features such as orientation (cross-orientation suppression), eye-of-origin (interocular suppression) and spatial location (surround suppression), which are thought to involve distinct anatomical pathways. We asked if these separate routes to suppression can be differentiated by their pattern of gain control on the contrast response function measured in human participants using steady-state electroencephalography. Changes in contrast gain shift the contrast response function laterally, whereas changes in response gain scale the function vertically. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to summarise the evidence for each type of gain control. A computational meta-analysis of 16 previous studies found the most evidence for contrast gain effects with overlaid masks, but no clear evidence favouring either response gain or contrast gain for other mask types. We then conducted two new experiments, comparing suppression from four mask types (monocular and dichoptic overlay masks, and aligned and orthogonal surround masks) on responses to sine wave grating patches flickering at 5Hz. At the occipital pole, there was strong evidence for contrast gain effects in all four mask types at the first harmonic frequency (5Hz). Suppression generally became stronger at more lateral electrode sites, but there was little evidence of response gain effects. At the second harmonic frequency (10Hz) suppression was stronger overall, and involved both contrast and response gain effects. Although suppression from different mask types involves distinct anatomical pathways, gain control processes appear to serve a common purpose, which we suggest might be to suppress less reliable inputs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.27.453123" rel="alternate" title="Electrophysiological measures of visual suppression (6 tweets)"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><published>2021-07-27T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.24.453650</id><title>A network-based approach reveals the dysregulated transcriptional regulation in non-alcohol fatty liver disease (6 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.829794+00:00</updated><author><name>Hong Yang</name></author><author><name>Muhammad Arif</name></author><author><name>Meng Yuan</name></author><author><name>Xiangyu Li</name></author><author><name>Ko Eun Shong</name></author><author><name>Hasan Turkez</name></author><author><name>Jens Nielsen</name></author><author><name>Mathias Uhlén</name></author><author><name>Jan Borén</name></author><author><name>Zhang Cheng</name></author><author><name>Adil Mardinoglu</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. We performed network analysis to investigate the dysregulated biological processes in the disease progression and revealed the molecular mechanism underlying NAFLD. Based on network analysis, we identified a highly conserved disease-associated gene module across three different NAFLD cohorts and highlighted the predominant role of key transcriptional regulators associated with lipid and cholesterol metabolism. In addition, we revealed the detailed metabolic differences between heterogenous NAFLD patients through integrative systems analysis of transcriptomic data and liver-specific genome-scale metabolic model. Furthermore, we identified transcription factors (TFs), including SREBF2, HNF4A, SREBF1, YY1 and KLF13, showing regulation of hepatic expression of genes in the NAFLD-associated modules and validated the TFs using data generated from a mouse NAFLD model.

While LNs are fairly stable in size during homeostatic conditions, immunological challenge causes more than 10-fold increase in size within only a few days. How a solid organ can accommodate such extreme volumetric changes is poorly understood. Here, we characterize the biomechanics of LN swelling on the cellular and organ scale. We identify lymphocyte trapping by influx and proliferation as drivers of an outward pressure force, causing FRCs and their associated conduits to stretch. After an initial phase of relaxation, FRCs sense the resulting strain via cell matrix adhesions, which coordinates local growth and remodeling of the stromal network. While the expanded FRC network adopts its typical configuration, a massive fibrotic reaction of the organ capsule sets in and counters further organ expansion. Thus, different fibroblast populations mechanically control LN swelling in a multi-tier fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.28.454217" rel="alternate" title="Multi-tier mechanics control stromal adaptations in swelling lymph nodes (6 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-07-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.29.454286</id><title>Structural basis for the therapeutic advantage of dual and triple agonists at the human GIP, GLP-1 or GCG receptors (6 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.830406+00:00</updated><author><name>Fenghui Zhao</name></author><author><name>Qingtong Zhou</name></author><author><name>Zhaotong Cong</name></author><author><name>Kaini Hang</name></author><author><name>Xinyu Zou</name></author><author><name>Chao Zhang</name></author><author><name>Yan Chen</name></author><author><name>Antao Dai</name></author><author><name>Anyi Liang</name></author><author><name>Qianqian Ming</name></author><author><name>Mu Wang</name></author><author><name>Linan Chen</name></author><author><name>Peiyu Xu</name></author><author><name>Rulue Chang</name></author><author><name>Wenbo Feng</name></author><author><name>Tian Xia</name></author><author><name>Yan Zhang</name></author><author><name>Beili Wu</name></author><author><name>Dehua Yang</name></author><author><name>Lihua Zhao</name></author><author><name>H.

Several multi-targeting agonists at GIPR, GLP-1R or GCGR, developed to maximize metabolic benefits with reduced side-effects, are in clinical trials to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which tirzepatide, a GIPR/GLP-1R dualagonist, and peptide 20, a GIPR/GLP-1R/GCGR triagonist, manifest their superior efficacies over monoagonist such as semaglutide, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of tirzepatide-bound GIPR and GLP-1R as well as peptide 20-bound GIPR, GLP-1R and GCGR The structures reveal both common and unique features for the dual and triple agonism by illustrating key interactions of clinical relevance at the atomic level.

Yet, few studies have directly examined the brain’s network structure during emotional experiences. Here, we investigated the brain’s functional network organization during experiences of sadness, amusement, and neutral states elicited by movies, in addition to a resting-state. We tested the effects of the experienced emotion on individual variability in the brain’s functional connectome. Next, for each state, we defined a community structure of the brain and quantified its segregation and integration. Our results show that emotional states increase the similarity between and within individuals in the brain’s functional connectome. Second, in the brain’s modular organization, sadness, relative to amusement, was associated with higher integration and increased connectivity of cognitive control networks: the salience and fronto-parietal networks. Importantly, the modular metrics of brain segregation and integration were related to the subjective emotional valence. Last, in both the functional connectome and emotional report, we found higher similarity among women. Our results suggest that the experience of emotion is linked to a reconfiguration of whole-brain distributed, not emotion-specific, functional brain networks and that the brain’s topological structure carries information about the subjective emotional experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.453552" rel="alternate" title="Emotional states as distinct configurations of functional brain networks (5 tweets)"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.453762</id><title>Effect of stimulation time on the expression of human macrophage polarization markers (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.830873+00:00</updated><author><name>Duygu Unuvar Purcu</name></author><author><name>Asli Korkmaz</name></author><author><name>Sinem Gunalp</name></author><author><name>Derya Goksu Helvaci</name></author><author><name>Yonca Erdal</name></author><author><name>Yavuz Dogan</name></author><author><name>Gerhard Wingender</name></author><author><name>Duygu Sag</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Macrophages are highly plastic cells that can polarize into functionally distinct subsets &lt;italic&gt;in vivo&lt;/italic&gt; and &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt; in response to environmental signals. The development of protocols to model macrophage polarization &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt; greatly contributes to our understanding of macrophage biology. Macrophages are divided into two main groups: Pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages (classically activated) and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages (alternatively activated), based on several key surface markers and the production of inflammatory mediators. However, the expression of these common macrophage polarization markers is greatly affected by the stimulation time used. Unfortunately, there is no consensus yet regarding the optimal stimulation times for particular macrophage polarization markers in &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt; experiments. This situation is problematic, (i) as analysing a particular marker at a suboptimal time point can lead to false-negative results, and (ii) as it clearly impedes the comparison of different studies. Using human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt;, we analysed how the expression of the main polarization markers for M1 (CD64, CD86, CXCL9, CXCL10, HLA-DR, IDO1, IL1β, IL12p70, TNF), M2a (CD200R, CD206, CCL17, CCL22, IL-10, TGM2), and M2c (CD163, IL-10, TGFβ) macrophages changes over time at mRNA and protein levels. Our data establish the most appropriate stimulation time for the analysis of the expression of human macrophage polarization markers &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt;.

However, our understanding of branch formation is sparse due to technical limitations. Using &lt;italic&gt;in situ&lt;/italic&gt; cellular cryo-electron tomography on primary mouse neurons, we directly visualized the remodeling of organelles and cytoskeleton structures at axon branches. Strikingly, branched areas functioned as hotspots concentrating organelles to support dynamic activities. Unaligned actin filaments assembled at the base of premature branches and remained while filopodia diminished. Microtubules and ER co-migrated into preformed branches to support outgrowth together with accumulating compact ~500 nm mitochondria and locally clustered ribosomes.

Despite the ubiquity of emotional signals in our environment, the neural mechanisms underlying their influence on goal-directed action remains unclear. Prior work suggests that the lateral frontal pole (FPl) is uniquely positioned to integrate affective information into cognitive control representations. We used pattern similarity analysis to examine the content of representations in FPl and interconnected mid-lateral prefrontal and amygdala circuitry. Healthy participants (n=37; n=21 females) were scanned while undergoing an event-related Affective Go/No-Go task, which requires goal-oriented action selection during emotional processing. We found that FPl contained conjunctive emotion-action goal representations that were related to successful cognitive control during emotional processing. These representations differed from conjunctive emotion-action goal representations found in the basolateral amygdala. While robust action goal representations were present in mid-lateral prefrontal cortex, they were not modulated by emotional valence. Finally, converging results from functional connectivity and multivoxel pattern analyses indicated that FPl’s emotional valence signals likely originated from interconnected subgenual ACC (BA25), which was in turn functionally coupled with the amygdala. Thus, our results identify a key pathway by which internal emotional states influence goal-directed behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Significance statement&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimal functioning in everyday life requires behavioral regulation that flexibly adapts to dynamically changing emotional states. However, precisely how emotional states influence goal-directed action remains unclear. Unveiling the neural architecture that supports emotion-goal integration is critical for our understanding of disorders such as psychopathy, which is characterized by deficits in incorporating emotional cues into goals, as well as mood and anxiety disorders, which are characterized by impaired goal-based emotion regulation. Our study identifies a key circuit through which emotional states influence goal-directed behavior. This circuitry comprised the lateral frontal pole (FPl), which represented integrated emotion-goal information, as well as interconnected amygdala and subgenual ACC, which conveyed emotional signals to FPl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.28.453895" rel="alternate" title="Emotional context sculpts action goal representations in the lateral frontal pole (5 tweets)"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><published>2021-07-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.452934</id><title>Modelling time evolution of in blood alcohol concentration (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.831705+00:00</updated><author><name>Antoni Oliver Gelabert</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;A theoretical model based on mass conservation is proposed to predict blood alcohol concentration (BAC) over time.

In birds, both invaders and migrants encounter novel situations, therefore one could expect that both groups might react similarly to novelty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we analyzed the behavioral responses of individuals from three populations of European starling &lt;italic&gt;Sturnus vulgaris&lt;/italic&gt;: a population settled for centuries in a rural region, a population that recently colonized an urban area, and a population of winter migrant birds. We conducted a social isolation test, a novel environment test, a novel food test and a novel object test to explore their reactions towards novelty. We identified and characterized different behavioral profiles for each test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group of migratory adults appeared to be less anxious in social isolation than the group of urban young. Urban and migrant groups entered the novel environment sooner than rural birds. Shy, bold and intermediate individuals were observed in all three groups when presented with novel food. Finally, the proportion of shy individuals which did not touch the novel object was higher than the proportion of bold individuals in the rural group. Our study emphasizes that neophilia or boldness present in migrant and invasive populations may facilitate the occupation of novel habitats. Our analysis also suggests that mixed reactions of neophobia ensure behavioral flexibility in a gregarious invasive species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Significant statement&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we show that an invasive species like European starling, &lt;italic&gt;Sturnus vulgaris&lt;/italic&gt;, presents an important flexibility in neophobia and in reaction towards social isolation. These variations depend on the settlement history of populationseven when the birds had been wild-caught as nestlings and hand-raised in standard conditions. This is significant because it highlights possible scenarios of colonization processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that this manuscript is appropriate for publication by Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology because it places individuals’ behavior in the core mechanisms of an ecological phenomenom as biological invasions.

Finally, we show the IRI-CCE platform as a reliable and rapid method for screening functional gRNAs to achieve successful GE outcomes.

Robert Horvitz</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Cell identity is characterized by a distinct combination of gene expression, cell morphology and cellular function established as progenitor cells divide and differentiate. Following establishment, cell identities can be unstable and require active and continuous maintenance throughout the remaining life of a cell. Mechanisms underlying the maintenance of cell identities are incompletely understood. Here we show that the gene &lt;italic&gt;ctbp-1,&lt;/italic&gt; which encodes the transcriptional corepressor &lt;underline&gt;C&lt;/underline&gt;-terminal &lt;underline&gt;b&lt;/underline&gt;inding &lt;underline&gt;p&lt;/underline&gt;rotein-1 (CTBP-1), is essential for the maintenance of the identities of the two AIA interneurons in the nematode &lt;italic&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/italic&gt;. &lt;italic&gt;ctbp-1&lt;/italic&gt; is not required for the establishment of the AIA cell fate but rather functions cell-autonomously and can act in older worms to maintain proper AIA gene expression, morphology and function. From a screen for suppressors of the &lt;italic&gt;ctbp-1&lt;/italic&gt; mutant phenotype, we identified the gene &lt;italic&gt;egl-13,&lt;/italic&gt; which encodes a SOX family transcription factor. We found that &lt;italic&gt;egl-13&lt;/italic&gt; regulates AIA function and aspects of AIA gene expression, but not AIA morphology. We conclude that the CTBP-1 protein maintains AIA cell identity in part by utilizing EGL-13 to repress transcriptional activity in the AIAs. More generally, we propose that transcriptional corepressors like CTBP-1 might be critical factors in the maintenance of cell identities, harnessing the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors like EGL-13 to selectively regulate gene expression in a cell-specific manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.28.454018" rel="alternate" title="The transcriptional corepressor CTBP-1 acts with the SOX family transcription factor EGL-13 to maintain AIA interneuron cell identity in C. elegans (4 tweets)"/><category term="Developmental Biology"/><published>2021-07-28T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.453568</id><title>Global, Low Amplitude Cortical State Predicts Response Outcomes in a Selective Detection Task (4 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.833000+00:00</updated><author><name>Krista Marrero</name></author><author><name>Krithiga Aruljothi</name></author><author><name>Behzad Zareian</name></author><author><name>Chengchun Gao</name></author><author><name>Zhaoran Zhang</name></author><author><name>Edward Zagha</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous neuronal activity strongly impacts stimulus encoding and behavioral responses. We sought to determine the effects of neocortical prestimulus activity on stimulus detection. We trained mice in a selective whisker detection task, in which they learned to respond (lick) to target stimuli in one whisker field and ignore distractor stimuli in the contralateral whisker field. During expert task performance, we used widefield Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging to assess prestimulus and post-stimulus neuronal activity broadly across frontal and parietal cortices. We found that lower prestimulus activity correlated with enhanced stimulus detection: lower prestimulus activity predicted response versus no response outcomes and faster reaction times. The activity predictive of trial outcome was distributed through dorsal neocortex, rather than being restricted to whisker or licking regions. Using principal component analysis, we demonstrate that response trials are associated with a distinct and less variable prestimulus neuronal subspace. For single units, prestimulus choice probability was weak yet distributed broadly, with lower than chance choice probability correlating with stronger sensory and motor encoding. These findings support a low amplitude, low variability, optimal prestimulus cortical state for stimulus detection that presents globally and predicts response outcomes for both target and distractor stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.453568" rel="alternate" title="Global, Low Amplitude Cortical State Predicts Response Outcomes in a Selective Detection Task (4 tweets)"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.30.454539</id><title>Engineering adoptive T cell therapy to co-opt Fas ligand-mediated death signaling in ovarian cancer enhances therapeutic efficacy (4 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.833194+00:00</updated><author><name>Kristin G.

Greenberg</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Background: In the U.S., more than 50% of ovarian cancer patients die within 5 years of diagnosis, highlighting the need for innovations such as engineered T cell therapies. Mesothelin (Msln) is an attractive immunotherapy target for this cancer, as it is overexpressed by the tumor and contributes to malignant and invasive phenotypes, making antigen loss disadvantageous to the tumor. We previously showed that adoptively transferred T cells engineered to be Msln-specific (TCR1045) preferentially accumulate within established ovarian tumors, delay tumor growth and significantly prolong survival in the ID8VEGF mouse model. However, T cell persistence and anti-tumor activity were not sustained, and we and others have previously detected FasL in the tumor vasculature and the tumor microenvironment (TME) of human and murine ovarian cancers, which can induce apoptosis in infiltrating lymphocytes expressing Fas receptor (Fas). Methods: To concurrently overcome this mechanism for potential immune evasion and enhance T cell responses, we generated an immunomodulatory fusion protein (IFP) containing the Fas extracellular binding domain fused to a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain, rather than the natural death domain. T cells engineered to express TCR1045 alone or in combination with the IFP were transferred into ID8VEGF-tumor bearing mice and evaluated for persistence, proliferation, anti-tumor cytokine production, and therapeutic efficacy. Results: Relative to T cells modified only to express TCR1045, T cells engineered to express both TCR1045 and a Fas IFP preferentially persisted in the TME of tumor-bearing mice due to improved T cell proliferation and survival. Moreover, adoptive immunotherapy with IFP+ T cells significantly prolonged survival in tumor-bearing mice, relative to TCR1045 T cells lacking the IFP. Conclusions: Fas/FasL signaling can mediate T cell death in the ovarian cancer microenvironment, as well as induce activation-induced cell death, an apoptotic mechanism responsible for regulating T cell expansion. Upregulation of FasL by tumor cells and tumor vasculature represents a mechanism for protecting growing tumors from attack by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. As many solid tumors overexpress FasL, an IFP that converts the Fas-mediated death signal into pro-survival and proliferative signals may provide an opportunity to enhance engineered adoptive T cell therapy against many malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.30.454539" rel="alternate" title="Engineering adoptive T cell therapy to co-opt Fas ligand-mediated death signaling in ovarian cancer enhances therapeutic efficacy (4 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-07-31T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.01.454622</id><title>Data Storage Based on Combinatorial Synthesis of DNA Shortmers (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.833394+00:00</updated><author><name>Inbal Preuss</name></author><author><name>Zohar Yakhini</name></author><author><name>Leon Anavy</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Storage needs represent a significant burden on the economy and the environment. Some of this can potentially be offset by improved density molecular storage. The potential of using DNA for storing data is immense. DNA can be harnessed as a high density, durable archiving medium for compressing and storing the exponentially growing quantities of digital data that mankind generates. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of DNA-based data storage systems. These include exploration of different encoding and error correction schemes and the use of different technologies for DNA synthesis and sequencing. Recently, the use of composite DNA letters has been demonstrated to leverage the inherent redundancy in DNA based storage systems to achieve higher logical density, offering a more cost-effective approach. However, the suggested composite DNA approach is still limited due to its sensitivity to the stochastic nature of the process. Combinatorial assembly methods were also suggested to encode information on DNA in high density, while avoding the challenges of the stochastic system. These are based on enzynatic assembly processes for producing the synthetic DNA. In this paper, we propose a novel method to encode information into DNA molecules using combinatorial encoding and shortmer DNA synthesis, in compatibility with current chemical DNA synthesis technologies. Our approach is based on a set of easily distinguishable DNA shortmers serving as building blocks and allowing for near-zero error rates. We construct an extended combinatorial alphabet in which every letter is a subset of the set of building blocks. We suggest different combinatorial encoding schemes and explore their theoretical properties and practical implications in terms of error probabilities and required sequencing depth. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we implemented an end-to-end computer simulation of a DNA-based storage system, using our suggested combinatorial encodings. We use simulations to assess the performance of the system and the effect of different parameters. Our simulations suggest that our combinatorial approach can potentially achieve up to 6.5-fold increase in the logical density over standard DNA based storage systems, with near zero reconstruction error. Implementing our approach at scale to perform actual synthesis, requires minimal alterations to current technologies. Our work thus suggests that the combination of combinatorial encoding with standard DNA chemical synthesis technologies can potentially improve current solutions, achieving scalable, efficient and cost- effective DNA-based storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.01.454622" rel="alternate" title="Data Storage Based on Combinatorial Synthesis of DNA Shortmers (3 tweets)"/><category term="Synthetic Biology"/><published>2021-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.29.454399</id><title>Neural-specific alterations in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis and cell signaling associated with two human ganglioside GM3 Synthase Deficiency variants (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.833551+00:00</updated><author><name>Michelle Dookwah</name></author><author><name>Shannon K Wagner</name></author><author><name>Mayumi Ishihara</name></author><author><name>Seok-ho Yu</name></author><author><name>Heidi Ulrichs</name></author><author><name>Michael J Kulik</name></author><author><name>Nadja Zeltner</name></author><author><name>Stephen Dalton</name></author><author><name>Kevin A Strauss</name></author><author><name>Kazuhiro Aoki</name></author><author><name>Richard Steet</name></author><author><name>Michael Tiemeyer</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;GM3 Synthase Deficiency (GM3SD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from pathogenic variants in the ST3GAL5 gene, which encodes GM3 synthase, a glycosphingolipid (GSL)-specific sialyltransferase. This enzyme adds a single alpha3-linked sialic acid to the terminal galactose of lactosylceramide (LacCer) to produce the monosialylated ganglioside GM3. In turn, GM3 is extended by other glycosyltransferases to generate nearly all the complex gangliosides enriched in neural tissue. Pathogenic mechanisms that account for neural phenotypes associated with GM3SD are not known. To explore how loss of GM3 impacts neural-specific glycolipid glycosylation and cell signaling, GM3SD patient fibroblasts bearing one of two different ST3GAL5 variants were reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and then differentiated to neural crest cells (NCCs). GM3 and GM3-derived gangliosides were undetectable in iPSCs and NCCs from both variants, while LacCer precursor levels were elevated compared to wildtype (WT). NCCs of both variants synthesized elevated levels of neutral lacto- and globo-series, as well as minor alternatively sialylated, GSLs compared to WT. Shifts in ceramide profiles associated with iPSC and NCC GSLs were also detected in GM3SD variants. Altered GSL profiles in the GM3SD cells were accompanied by dynamic changes in the cell surface proteome, protein O-GlcNAcylation, and receptor tyrosine kinase abundance. GM3SD cells also exhibited increased apoptosis and sensitivity to erlotnib, an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. Pharmacologic inhibition of O-GlcNAcase increased protein O-GlcNAcylation and significantly rescued baseline and erlotnib-induced apoptosis. Collectively, these findings indicate broad effects on cell signaling during differentiation of GM3SD patient-derived iPSCs to NCCs. Thus, human GM3SD cells provide a novel platform to investigate structure/function relationships that connect GSL diversity to cell signaling, cell survival, and neural differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.29.454399" rel="alternate" title="Neural-specific alterations in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis and cell signaling associated with two human ganglioside GM3 Synthase Deficiency variants (3 tweets)"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><published>2021-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.24.453664</id><title>Habituation, task solving and memorization may facilitate biological invasions: the Starling example (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.833773+00:00</updated><author><name>Alexandra Rodriguez</name></author><author><name>Martine Hausberger</name></author><author><name>Philippe Clergeau</name></author><author><name>Laurence Henry</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Invasions ecology deals more and more with behavioural characteristics of invasive species. Particularly, research have focused on the personality of invaders and on their way of coping with novelty in new habitats. Traits of neophobia may limit individuals in their exploration of novel objects or the consumption of novel foods, they may stop the access to valuable ressources. Actually, in novel environments like cities, food can be unreachable in throwaway dishes with lids or hidden in the garbage or even close to frightening objects. Animals may either left the place and waste these resources, or they can express low neophobia from the beginning and manipulate the objects to reach food. They may also habituate progressively to the context and use the ressources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we analyzed the behavioural responses of individuals from three populations of European starling &lt;italic&gt;Sturnus vulgaris&lt;/italic&gt;: a population anciently settled in a rural region, a population that has recently colonized a urban area and a population of wintering migrant birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a series of tests in order to explore if individuals would habituate to a novel object and if they could remember it eight months later. We explored if individuals would be less neophobic when confronted to two novel objects successively and we tested them in a learning task involving a novel object and an attractive food. Our results show that &lt;italic&gt;Sturnus vulgaris&lt;/italic&gt; habituates rapidly to novel objects and that categorization facilitates neophobia lost when confronted to two different novel objects. Initially young birds appeared to be more skilled than adults in the learning task. Individuals from this species seem to be able to remember an object durably.

Van Raamsdonk</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Different melanoma subtypes exhibit specific and non-overlapping sets of oncogene and tumor suppressor mutations, despite a common cell of origin in melanocytes. For example, activation of the Gα&lt;sub&gt;q/11&lt;/sub&gt; signaling pathway is a characteristic initiating event in primary melanomas that arise in the dermis, uveal tract or central nervous system. It is rare in melanomas arising in the epidermis. Here, we present evidence that in the mouse, crosstalk with the epidermal microenvironment actively impairs the survival of melanocytes expressing the GNAQ&lt;sup&gt;Q209L&lt;/sup&gt; oncogene, providing a new model for oncogene specificity in cancer. The presence of epidermal cells inhibited cell division and fragmented dendrites of melanocytes expressing GNAQ&lt;sup&gt;Q209L&lt;/sup&gt; in culture, while they promoted the growth of normal melanocytes. Differential gene expression analysis of FACS sorted epidermal melanocytes showed that cells expressing GNAQ&lt;sup&gt;Q209L&lt;/sup&gt; exhibit an oxidative stress and apoptosis signature previously linked to vitiligo. Furthermore, PLCB4, the direct downstream effector of Gα&lt;sub&gt;q/11&lt;/sub&gt; signaling, is frequently mutated in cutaneous melanoma alongside P53 and NF1. Our results suggest that a deficiency of PLCB4 promotes cutaneous melanomagenesis by reducing GNAQ driven signaling. Hence, our studies reveal the flip side of the GNAQ/PLCB4 signaling pathway, which was hitherto unsuspected. In the future, understanding how epidermal crosstalk restrains the GNAQ&lt;sup&gt;Q209L&lt;/sup&gt; oncogene could suggest novel melanoma therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.453858" rel="alternate" title="Crosstalk with keratinocytes causes GNAQ oncogene specificity in melanoma (3 tweets)"/><category term="Cancer Biology"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.21261034</id><title>Running related biomechanical risk factors for overuse injuries in distance runners: A systematic review considering injury specificity and the potentials for future research (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.834099+00:00</updated><author><name>Steffen Willwacher</name></author><author><name>Markus Kurz</name></author><author><name>Johanna Robbin</name></author><author><name>Matthias Thelen</name></author><author><name>Joseph Hamill</name></author><author><name>Luke Kelly</name></author><author><name>Patrick Mai</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Objective&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify and evaluate the evidence of the most relevant running-related risk factors (RRRFs) for running-related overuse injuries (ROIs) and to suggest future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Design&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic review considering prospective and retrospective studies.

Levels of evidence for specific ROIs ranged from conflicting to moderate evidence. Running populations and methods applied varied considerably between studies.

Although delivery of a wild-type copy of the mutated gene to cells represents the most curative approach for a monogenic disease, proof-of-concept studies highlight significant efficacy caveats for brain gene therapy. Herein, we used a secretable TATk-CDKL5 protein to enhance the efficiency of a gene therapy for CDD. We found that, although AAVPHP.B_Igk-TATk-CDKL5 and AAVPHP.B_CDKL5 vectors had similar brain infection efficiency, the AAVPHP.B_Igk-TATk-CDKL5 vector led to a higher CDKL5 protein replacement due to secretion and transduction of the TATk-CDKL5 protein into the neighboring cells.

It is widely thought that integrins must be activated before they bind ligand; however, one model holds that activation follows ligand binding. As ligand-binding kinetics are not only rate limiting for cell adhesion but also have important implications for the mechanism of activation, we measure them here for integrins α4β1 and α5β1 and show that the low-affinity states bind substantially faster than the high-affinity state. On and off-rate measurements are similar for integrins on cell surfaces and ectodomain fragments. Although the extended-open conformation’s on-rate is ∼20-fold slower, its off-rate is ∼25,000-fold slower, resulting in a large affinity increase.

RTX is a potent capsaicin analog with specific biological activities resulting from its agonist activity with the transient receptor potential channel vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1). RTX has been examined as a pain reliever, and more recently, investigated for its ability to desensitize cardiac sensory fibers expressing TRPV1 to improve chronic heart failure (CHF) outcomes using validated animal models. &lt;italic&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/italic&gt; (&lt;italic&gt;C. elegans&lt;/italic&gt;) expresses orthologs of vanilloid receptors activated by capsaicin, producing antinociceptive effects. Thus, we used &lt;italic&gt;C. elegans&lt;/italic&gt; to characterize the antinociceptive properties and performed proteomic profiling to uncover specific signaling networks. After exposure to RTX, wild-type (N2) and mutant &lt;italic&gt;C. elegans&lt;/italic&gt; were placed on petri dishes divided into quadrants for heat stimulation. The thermal avoidance index was used to phenotype each tested &lt;italic&gt;C. elegans&lt;/italic&gt; experimental group. The data revealed for the first time that RTX can hamper the nocifensive response of &lt;italic&gt;C. elegans&lt;/italic&gt; to noxious heat (32°C – 35°C). The effect was reversed 6 h after RTX exposure. Additionally, we identified the RTX target, the &lt;italic&gt;C. elegans&lt;/italic&gt; transient receptor potential channel OCR-3. The proteomics and pathway enrichment analysis results suggest that Wnt signaling is triggered by the agonistic effects of RTX on &lt;italic&gt;C. elegans&lt;/italic&gt; vanilloid receptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.453516" rel="alternate" title="Resiniferatoxin hampers the nocifensive response of Caenorhabditis elegans to noxious heat, and pathway analysis revealed that the Wnt signaling pathway is involved (3 tweets)"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.453707</id><title>Opposing roles of blood-borne monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages in limbal stem cell damage after ocular injury (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.835019+00:00</updated><author><name>Chengxin Zhou</name></author><author><name>Fengyang Lei</name></author><author><name>Mirja Mittermaier</name></author><author><name>Bruce Ksander</name></author><author><name>Reza Dana</name></author><author><name>Claes H.

Previous studies have assumed that this is mediated by direct chemical injury. Here we show that LSC loss can occur even without direct chemical injury to LSCs. Elevation of anterior chamber (AC) pH causes acute uveal stress, release of inflammatory cytokines at the basal limbal tissue, and subsequent LSC death. In particular, peripherally-derived CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;−-&lt;/sup&gt;monocytes cause upregulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) at the limbus, causing LSC loss. In contrast to peripherally-derived monocytes, CX3CR1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CCR2&lt;sup&gt;−-&lt;/sup&gt;tissue-resident macrophages are protective. Pharmacological depletion of tissue-resident macrophages prior to injury exacerbates LSC loss and increases LSC vulnerability to apoptosis following exposure to TNF-α, despite reduced CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;cell infiltration into the tissue. Consistently, repopulation of the cornea by new tissue-resident macrophages after depletion reverse LSC susceptibility to inflammatory cell death. This findings have important implication in LSC protection after chemical injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Significance&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limbal stem cell (LSC) loss after chemical burn is a significant clinical problem that has long been thought to be the result of direct chemical injury. This study demonstrates the existence of competing inflammatory mechanism responsible for LSC death, mediated by infiltrating peripheral monocytes that antagonize and overcome the protective role of tissue-resident macrophages. Thus, enhancing the role of tissue-resident macrophages while suppressing that of infiltrating monocytes could be a novel therapeutic strategy for LSC survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.453707" rel="alternate" title="Opposing roles of blood-borne monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages in limbal stem cell damage after ocular injury (3 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.453697</id><title>Specialized subsets of innate-like T cells and dendritic cells protect from lethal pneumococcal infection in the lung (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.835208+00:00</updated><author><name>Mallory Paynich Murray</name></author><author><name>Catherine M.

They carry out protective responses during infections, but the mechanisms for protection are not completely understood. Here, we investigated their roles during pulmonary infection with &lt;italic&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/italic&gt;. Following infection, innate-like T cells rapidly increased in lung tissue, in part through recruitment, but TCR activation and cytokine production occurred mostly in IL-17-producing NKT17 and γδ T cells. NKT17 cells were preferentially located outside the vasculature prior to infection, as were CD103&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dendritic cells (cDC1), which were important both for antigen presentation to NKT17 cells and γδ T cell activation. Whereas IL-17A-producing γδ T cells also were numerous, GM-CSF was exclusive to NKT17 cells and contributed to iNKT cell-mediated protection. These studies demonstrate how particular cellular interactions and responses of functional subsets of innate-like T cells contribute to protection from pathogenic lung infection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.453697" rel="alternate" title="Specialized subsets of innate-like T cells and dendritic cells protect from lethal pneumococcal infection in the lung (3 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.28.454154</id><title>Muscarinic receptors mediate motivation via preparatory neural activity in humans (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.835444+00:00</updated><author><name>John P.

A corresponding effect in humans would be important clinically, since anticholinergic drugs are frequently used in Parkinson’s disease, a condition that can also disrupt motivation. Reward and dopamine make us more ready to respond, as indexed by reaction times (RT), and move faster, sometimes termed vigour. These effects may be controlled by preparatory processes that can be tracked using EEG. We measured vigour in a placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of trihexyphenidyl (THP), a muscarinic antagonist, with an incentivised eye movement task and EEG. Participants responded faster and with greater vigour when incentives were high, but THP blunted these motivation effects, suggesting that muscarinic receptors facilitate invigoration by reward. Preparatory EEG build-up (contingent negative variation; CNV) was strengthened by high incentives and by muscarinic blockade. The amplitude of preparatory activity predicted both vigour and RT, although over distinct scalp regions. Frontal activity predicted vigour, whereas a larger, earlier, central component predicted RT. Indeed the incentivisation of RT was partly mediated by the CNV, though vigour was not. Moreover, the CNV mediated the drug’s effect on dampening incentives, suggesting that muscarinic receptors underlie the motivational influence on this preparatory activity. Taken together, these findings show that a muscarinic blocker used to treat Parkinson’s disease impairs motivated action in healthy people, and that medial frontal preparatory neural activity mediates this for RT.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.28.454154" rel="alternate" title="Muscarinic receptors mediate motivation via preparatory neural activity in humans (3 tweets)"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><published>2021-07-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry></feed>
