In this study, we aimed to estimate the VE when combining the ChAdOx1 vaccine as the first dose and an mRNA vaccine as the second dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This nationwide population-based cohort study estimated VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection, all-cause and COVID-19 related hospitalization and death after receiving the ChAdOx1 vaccine as the first dose followed by an mRNA vaccine as the second dose. VE estimates were obtained using a Cox regression with calendar time as underlying time and adjusted for sex, age, comorbidity, heritage and hospital admission. Information on all individuals was extracted and linked from high-quality national registries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 5,542,079 individuals were included in the analyses (97.6% of the total Danish population). A total of 144,360 were vaccinated with the ChAdOx1 vaccine as the first dose and of these 136,551 individuals received an mRNA vaccine as the second dose. A total of 1,691,464 person-years and 83,034 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection when combining the ChAdOx1 and an mRNA vaccine was 88% (95% confidence interval (CI): 83; 92) 14 days after the second dose and onwards. There were no COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths among the individuals vaccinated with the combination of the ChAdOx1 and an mRNA vaccine during the study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this study found a reduction in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection when combining the ChAdOx1 and an mRNA vaccine, compared with unvaccinated individuals. This is similar to the VE of two doses of an mRNA vaccine. Longer follow-up time is needed to confirm vaccine induced protection against severe events, such as COVID-19 related hospitalization and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.21261130" rel="alternate" title="Vaccine effectiveness when combining the ChAdOx1 vaccine as the first dose with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine as the second dose (2040 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-07-28T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.21261030</id><title>Breakthrough Symptomatic COVID-19 Infections Leading to Long Covid: Report from Long Covid Facebook Group Poll (332 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.775579+00:00</updated><author><name>Daisy Massey</name></author><author><name>Diana Berrent</name></author><author><name>Harlan Krumholz</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Vaccines have been shown to be extremely effective in preventing COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. However, a question remains whether vaccine breakthrough cases can still lead to Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), also known as Long Covid. To address this question, the Survivor Corps group, a grassroots COVID-19 organization focused on patient support and research, posted a poll to its 169,900 members that asked about breakthrough cases, Long Covid, and hospitalizations. 1,949 people who self-report being fully vaccinated have responded to date. While robust data are needed in a larger, unbiased sample to extrapolate rates to the population, we analyzed the results of this public poll to determine what people were reporting regarding Long Covid after breakthrough infection and to prompt discussion of how breakthrough cases are measured. The poll was posted in the Survivor Corps Facebook group (∼169,900 members). Of the 1,949 participants who responded to the poll, 44 reported a symptomatic breakthrough case and 24 of those reported that the case led to symptoms of Long Covid. 1 of these 24 cases was reported to have led to hospitalization in addition to Long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.21261030" rel="alternate" title="Breakthrough Symptomatic COVID-19 Infections Leading to Long Covid: Report from Long Covid Facebook Group Poll (332 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.30.454437</id><title>Highly efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cardiomyocytes: spike protein-mediated cell fusion and its inhibition (68 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.775829+00:00</updated><author><name>Chanakha K.

Cardiac damage is attributed mostly to a bystander effect: the aberrant host response to acute respiratory infection. However, direct infection of cardiac tissue by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also occurs. We examined here the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) that beat spontaneously. These cardiomyocytes express the angiotensin I converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and a subset of the proteases that mediate spike protein cleavage in the lungs, but not transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection was productive: viral transcripts accounted for about 88% of total mRNA. In the cytoplasm of infected hiPSC-CM, smooth walled exocytic vesicles contained numerous 65-90 nm particles with typical ribonucleocapsid structures, and virus-like particles with knob-like spikes covered the cell surface. To better understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 spread in hiPSC-CM we engineered an expression vector coding for the spike protein with a monomeric emerald-green fluorescent protein fused to its cytoplasmic tail (S-mEm). Proteolytic processing of S-mEm and the parental spike were equivalent. Live cell imaging tracked spread of S-mEm signal from cell to cell and documented formation of syncytia. A cell-permeable, peptide-based molecule that blocks the catalytic site of furin abolished cell fusion. A spike mutant with the single amino acid change R682S that inactivates the furin cleavage site was fusion inactive. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in hiPSC-CM and furin activation of its spike protein is required for fusion-based cytopathology. This hiPSC-CM platform provides an opportunity for target-based drug discovery in cardiac COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.30.454437" rel="alternate" title="Highly efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cardiomyocytes: spike protein-mediated cell fusion and its inhibition (68 tweets)"/><category term="Microbiology"/><published>2021-07-30T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.21261041</id><title>The impact of large mobile air purifiers on aerosol concentration in classrooms and the reduction of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (58 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.776106+00:00</updated><author><name>F.

Especially in schools, the duration of stay is long and the number of people in the rooms is large, increasing the risk of infection. This problem particularly affects schools without pre-installed ventilation systems that are equipped with filters and/or operate with fresh air. Here, the aerosol concentration is reduced by natural ventilation. In this context, we are investigating the effect of large mobile air purifiers (AP) with HEPA filters on particle concentration and their suitability for classroom use in a primary school in Germany. The three tested APs differ significantly in their air outlet characteristics. Measurements of the number of particles, the particle size distribution, and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration were carried out in the classroom with students (April/May 2021) and with an aerosol generator without students. In this regard, the use of APs leads to a substantial reduction in aerosol particles. At the same time, the three APs are found to have differences in their particle decay rate, noise level, and flow velocity. In addition to the measurements, the effect of various influencing parameters on the potential inhaled particle dose was investigated using a calculation model. The parameters considered include the duration of stay, particle concentration in exhaled air, respiratory flow rate, virus lifetime, ventilation interval, ventilation efficiency, AP volumetric flow, as well as room size. Based on the resulting effect diagrams, significant recommendations can be derived for reducing the risk of infection from virus-laden aerosols. Finally, the measurements were compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, as such tools can aid the optimal placement and configuration of APs and can be used to study the effect of the spread of aerosols from a source in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.21261041" rel="alternate" title="The impact of large mobile air purifiers on aerosol concentration in classrooms and the reduction of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (58 tweets)"/><category term="Public and Global Health"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.24.21261040</id><title>Novel risk factors for Coronavirus disease-associated mucormycosis (CAM): a case control study during the outbreak in India (51 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.776302+00:00</updated><author><name>Umang Arora</name></author><author><name>Megha Priyadarshi</name></author><author><name>Varidh Katiyar</name></author><author><name>Manish Soneja</name></author><author><name>Prerna Garg</name></author><author><name>Ishan Gupta</name></author><author><name>Vishwesh Bharadiya</name></author><author><name>Parul Berry</name></author><author><name>Tamoghna Ghosh</name></author><author><name>Lajjaben Patel</name></author><author><name>Radhika Sarda</name></author><author><name>Shreya Garg</name></author><author><name>Shubham Agarwal</name></author><author><name>Veronica Arora</name></author><author><name>Aishwarya Ramprasad</name></author><author><name>Amit Kumar</name></author><author><name>Rohit Kumar Garg</name></author><author><name>Parul Kodan</name></author><author><name>Neeraj Nischal</name></author><author><name>Gagandeep Singh</name></author><author><name>Pankaj Jorwal</name></author><author><name>Arvind Kumar</name></author><author><name>Upendra Baitha</name></author><author><name>Ved Prakash Meena</name></author><author><name>Animesh Ray</name></author><author><name>Prayas Sethi</name></author><author><name>Immaculata Xess</name></author><author><name>Naval Vikram</name></author><author><name>Sanjeev Sinha</name></author><author><name>Ashutosh Biswas</name></author><author><name>Alok Thakar</name></author><author><name>Sushma Bhatnagar</name></author><author><name>Anjan Trikha</name></author><author><name>Naveet Wig</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The epidemiology of the Coronavirus-disease associated mucormycosis (CAM) syndemic is poorly elucidated. We aimed to identify risk factors that may explain the burden of cases and help develop preventive strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We performed a case-control study comparing cases diagnosed with CAM and those who had recovered from COVID-19 without developing mucormycosis (controls). Information on comorbidities, glycemic control, and practices related to COVID-19 prevention and treatment was recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;352 patients (152 cases and 200 controls) diagnosed with COVID-19 during April-May 2021 were included. In the CAM group, symptoms of mucormycosis began a mean 18.9 (SD 9.1) days after onset of COVID-19, and predominantly rhino-sinus and orbital involvement was present. All, but one, CAM cases carried conventional risk factors of diabetes and steroid use. On multivariable regression, increased odds of CAM were associated with the presence of diabetes (adjusted OR 3.5, 95%CI 1.1-11), use of systemic steroids (aOR 7.7,95% CI 2.4-24.7), prolonged use of cloth and surgical masks (vs no mask, aOR 6.9, 95%CI 1.5-33.1), and repeated nasopharyngeal swab testing during the COVID-19 illness (aOR 1.6,95% CI 1.2-2.2). Zinc therapy, probably due to its utility in immune function, was found to be protective (aOR 0.05, 95%CI 0.01-0.19). Notably, the requirement of oxygen supplementation or hospitalization did not affect the risk of CAM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judicious use of steroids and stringent glycemic control are vital to preventing mucormycosis. Use of clean masks, preference for N95 masks if available, and minimizing swab testing after the diagnosis of COVID-19 may further reduce the incidence of CAM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.24.21261040" rel="alternate" title="Novel risk factors for Coronavirus disease-associated mucormycosis (CAM): a case control study during the outbreak in India (51 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.21261093</id><title>Protection afforded by the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines in fully vaccinated cohorts with and without prior infection (34 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.776859+00:00</updated><author><name>Laith J.

Here, we investigated whether persons vaccinated after a prior infection have better protection against future infection than those vaccinated without prior infection. Effect of prior infection was assessed in Qatar’s population, where the Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351) variants dominate incidence, using two national retrospective, matched-cohort studies, one for the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine, and one for the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine. Incidence rates of infection among BNT162b2-vaccinated persons, with and without prior infection, were estimated, respectively, at 1.66 (95% CI: 1.26-2.18) and 11.02 (95% CI: 9.90-12.26) per 10,000 person-weeks. The incidence rate ratio was 0.15 (95% CI: 0.11-0.20). Analogous incidence rates among mRNA-1273-vaccinated persons were estimated at 1.55 (95% CI: 0.86-2.80) and 1.83 (95% CI: 1.07-3.16) per 10,000 person-weeks. The incidence rate ratio was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.34-2.05). Prior infection enhanced protection of those BNT162b2-vaccinated, but not those mRNA-1273-vaccinated. These findings may have implications for dosing, interval between doses, and potential need for booster vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.21261093" rel="alternate" title="Protection afforded by the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines in fully vaccinated cohorts with and without prior infection (34 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.453673</id><title>Multivariate mining of an alpaca immune repertoire identifies potent cross-neutralising SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies (19 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.777175+00:00</updated><author><name>Leo Hanke</name></author><author><name>Daniel J.

Here we combine phage display, multivariate enrichment, and novel sequence analysis techniques to annotate an entire nanobody repertoire from an immunized alpaca. We combine this approach with a streamlined screening strategy to identify numerous anti-SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies, and use neutralization assays and Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) epitope mapping to characterize their potency and specificity. Epitope mapping revealed that the binding site is a key determinant of neutralization potency, rather than affinity alone. The most potent nanobodies bind to the receptor binding motif of the RBD, directly preventing interaction with the host cell receptor ACE2, and we identify two exceptionally potent members of this category (with monomeric IC50s around 13 and 16 ng/ml). Other nanobodies bind to a more conserved epitope on the side of the RBD, and are able to potently neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 founder virus (42 ng/ml), the beta variant (B.1.351/501Y.V2) (35 ng/ml), and also cross-neutralize the more distantly related SARS-CoV-1 (0.46 μg/ml). The approach presented here is well suited for the screening of phage libraries to identify functional nanobodies for various biomedical and biochemical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.453673" rel="alternate" title="Multivariate mining of an alpaca immune repertoire identifies potent cross-neutralising SARS-CoV-2 nanobodies (19 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.21261042</id><title>Robust antibody levels in both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals after BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (13 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.777728+00:00</updated><author><name>Hamad Ali</name></author><author><name>Abdelmohsen Al-Terki</name></author><author><name>Sardar Sindhu</name></author><author><name>Barrak Alahmad</name></author><author><name>Maha Hammad</name></author><author><name>Salman Al-Sabah</name></author><author><name>Mohammad Alghounaim</name></author><author><name>Mohammad H.

Given their increased susceptibility to COVID-19, the question arises whether individuals with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and other metabolic conditions can respond effectively to the mRNA-based vaccine. We aimed to evaluate the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralizing antibodies in people with T2DM and/or other metabolic risk factors (hypertension and obesity) compared to those without. This study included 262 people that took two doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) mRNA vaccine. Both T2DM and non-diabetic individuals had a robust response to vaccination as demonstrated by their high antibody titers. However, both SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralizing antibodies titers were lower in people with T2DM. Their levels were 154±49.1 vs. 138±59.4BAU/mL for IgG and 87.1±11.6 vs. 79.7±19.5% for neutralizing antibodies in individuals without diabetes compared to those with T2DM, respectively. In a multiple linear regression adjusted for individual characteristics, comorbidities, previous COVID-19 infection and duration since second vaccine dose, diabetics had 13.86 BAU/ml (95%CI: −27.08 to −0.64BAU/ml, p=0.041) less IgG antibodies and 4.42% (95%CI: −8.53 to −0.32%, p=0.036) less neutralizing antibodies than non-diabetics. Hypertension and obesity did not show significant changes in antibody titers. Taken together, both type-2 diabetic and non-diabetic individuals elicited strong immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine; nonetheless, lower levels were seen in people with diabetes. Continuous monitoring of the antibody levels might be a good indicator to guide personalized needs for further booster shots to maintain adaptive immunity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.21261042" rel="alternate" title="Robust antibody levels in both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals after BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (13 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.24.21261065</id><title>COVID-Q: validation of the first COVID-19 questionnaire based on patient-rated symptom gravity (7 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.778240+00:00</updated><author><name>G Spinato</name></author><author><name>C Fabbris</name></author><author><name>F Conte</name></author><author><name>A Menegaldo</name></author><author><name>L Franz</name></author><author><name>P Gaudioso</name></author><author><name>F Cinetto</name></author><author><name>C Agostini</name></author><author><name>G Costantini</name></author><author><name>P Boscolo-Rizzo</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Objectives&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of the present study was to develop and validate the CoronaVirus Disease – 2019 (COVID-19) Questionnaire (COVID-Q), a novel symptom questionnaire specific for COVID-19 patients, to provide a comprehensive evaluation which may be helpful for physicians.. A secondary goal of the present study was to evaluate the performance of the COVID-Q in identifying subjects at higher risk of being tested positive for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Material and methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consecutive non-hospitalized adults who underwent nasopharyngeal and throat swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection at Treviso Hospital in March 2020, were enrolled. Subjects were divided into positive (cases) and negative (controls) in equal number. All of them gave consent and answered the COVID-Q. Patients not able to answer the COVID-Q due to clinical conditions were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parallel Analysis and Principal Component Analysis were used to identify clusters of items measuring the same dimension. The Item Response Theory (IRT)-based analyses evaluated the functioning of item categories, the presence of clusters of local dependence among items, item fit within the model and model fit to the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answers obtained from 230 COVID-19 cases (113 males, and 117 females; mean age 55 years, range 20-99 years) and 230 controls (61 males, and 169 females; mean age 46 years, range 21-89) were analyzed. Parallel analysis led to the extraction of six components, which corresponded to as many clinical presentation patterns: asthenia, influenza-like symptoms, ear and nose symptoms, breathing issues, throat symptoms, and anosmia/ageusia. The final IRT models retained 27 items as significant for symptom assessment. The total score on the questionnaire was significantly associated with positivity to the molecular SARS-CoV-2 test: subjects with multiple symptoms were significantly more likely to be affected by COVID-19 (p &amp;lt; .001). Older age and male gender also represented risk factors. Presence of breathing issues and anosmia/ageusia were significantly related to positivity to SARS-CoV-2 (p &amp;lt; 0.001). None of the examined comorbidities had a significant association with COVID-19 diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the analyses, COVID-Q could be validated since the aspects it evaluated were overall significantly related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The application of the novel COVID-Q to everyday clinical practice may help identifying subjects who are likely to be affected by COVID-19 and address them to a nasopharyngeal swab in order to achieve an early diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;What is already known about this topic?&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 symptoms are widely known. Lots of studies have been published regarding self-administered questionnaires in order to characterize and know as much as possible regarding this disease. By the way, no specific questionnaires have been validated, yet, and there is no consensus regarding this topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;What does this article add?&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper shows the COVID-Q, a novel symptom questionnaire specific for COVID-19 patients. The aim is to provide a comprehensive evaluation that may be helpful to clinicians in order to suspect SARS-CoV-2 infection or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.24.21261065" rel="alternate" title="COVID-Q: validation of the first COVID-19 questionnaire based on patient-rated symptom gravity (7 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.21261146</id><title>Laboratory Study of Physical Barrier Efficiency for Worker Protection against SARS-CoV-2 while Standing or Sitting (7 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.778699+00:00</updated><author><name>Jacob Bartels</name></author><author><name>Cheryl Fairfield Estill</name></author><author><name>I-Chen Chen</name></author><author><name>Dylan Neu</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Transparent barriers were installed as a response to the SARS-COV-2 pandemic in many customer-facing industries. Transparent barriers are an engineering control that are utilized to intercept air traveling between customers to workers. Information on the effectiveness of these barriers against aerosols is limited. In this study, a cough simulator was used to represent a cough from a customer. Two optical particle counters were used (one on each side of the barrier, labeled reference and worker) to determine the number of particles that migrated around a transparent barrier. Nine barrier sizes and a no barrier configuration were tested with six replicates each. Tests of these 10 configurations were conducted for both sitting and standing scenarios to represent configurations common to nail salons and grocery stores, respectively. Barrier efficiency was calculated using a ratio of the particle count results (reference/worker). Barriers had better efficiency when they were 9 to 39 cm (3.5 to 15.5”) above cough height and at least 91 cm (36”) wide, 92% and 93% respectively. Barriers that were 91 cm (36”) above table height for both scenarios blocked 71% or more of the particles between 0.35–0.725 µm and 68% for particles between 1 to 3 µm. A barrier that blocked an initial cough was effective at reducing particle counts. While the width of barriers was not as significant as height in determining barrier efficiency it was important that a barrier be placed where interactions between customers and workers are most frequent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.26.21261146" rel="alternate" title="Laboratory Study of Physical Barrier Efficiency for Worker Protection against SARS-CoV-2 while Standing or Sitting (7 tweets)"/><category term="Occupational and Environmental Health"/><published>2021-07-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.30.454402</id><title>Structures of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 neutralizing antibodies provide insights into cocktail design against concerning variants (7 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.779186+00:00</updated><author><name>Shuo Du</name></author><author><name>Pulan Liu</name></author><author><name>Zhiying Zhang</name></author><author><name>Tianhe Xiao</name></author><author><name>Ayijiang Yasimayi</name></author><author><name>Weijin Huang</name></author><author><name>Youchun Wang</name></author><author><name>Yunlong Richard Cao</name></author><author><name>Xiaoliang Sunney Xie</name></author><author><name>Junyu Xiao</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 variants could seriously dampen the global effort to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, we investigated the humoral antibody responses of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients and vaccinees towards circulating variants, and identified a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that could efficiently neutralize the B.1.351 (Beta) variant. Here we investigate how these mAbs target the B.1.351 spike protein using cryo-electron microscopy. In particular, we show that two superpotent mAbs, BD-812 and BD-836, have non-overlapping epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike. Both block the interaction between RBD and the ACE2 receptor; and importantly, both remain fully efficacious towards the B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants. The BD-812/BD-836 pair could thus serve as an ideal antibody cocktail against the SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.30.454402" rel="alternate" title="Structures of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 neutralizing antibodies provide insights into cocktail design against concerning variants (7 tweets)"/><category term="Biochemistry"/><published>2021-08-01T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.21261025</id><title>Clinical echocardiography does not indicate cardiac dysfunction in critically ill Covid-19 patients (6 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.779745+00:00</updated><author><name>Henrik Isackson</name></author><author><name>Anders Larsson</name></author><author><name>Miklos Lipcsey</name></author><author><name>Robert Frithiof</name></author><author><name>Frank A.

From this group 34 underwent echocardiographic examination of which 25 were included in the study, and compared to 44 non-echo patients. Demographic analysis compared standard parameters and previous morbidities between the echo and non-echo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standard echocardiographic parameters were analysed indicating a reduced left ventricular function as assessed by global longitudinal strain and very discrete increases in wall thickness in the group as a whole. A group comparison between the outcomes survival and death was carried out. Right sided dimensions and functional parameters did not indicate major strain. An increased maximum tricuspid valve regurgitation velocity indicating increased pulmonary arterial pressure was significantly associated with death, but failed to maintain significance when corrected for multiple comparison. Biochemical cardiac markers and D-dimer correlated to initiation of echocardiography and mortality. Tricuspid regurgitation maximum velocity was positively correlated with maximum troponin I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggests that there is no clear negative effect on cardiac function in critical SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are indications that pulmonary pressure elevation carries a negative predictive outcome suggesting pulmonary disease as the major driver of mortality.

Additionally, accurate assessment of the evolution, extent and dynamics of the outbreak are required to understand the transmission of the virus amongst seemingly unrelated cases and provide critical epidemiological information. To address these challenges, we evaluated a new high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS), respiratory viral panel (RVP) that includes 40 viral pathogens with the aim of analyzing viral subtypes, mutational variants of SARS-CoV-2, model to understand the spread of the virus in the state of Georgia, USA, and to assess other circulating viruses in the same population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study evaluated a total of 522 samples that included 483 patient samples and 42 synthetic positive control material. The performance metrics were calculated for both clinical and reference control samples by comparing detection results with the RT-PCR assay. The limit of detection (LoD) studies were conducted as per the FDA guidelines. Inference and visualization of the phylogeny of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences were performed through the Nextstrain Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool, utilizing the associated augur and auspice toolkits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The performance metrics calculated using both the clinical samples and the reference controls revealed a PPA, NPA and accuracy of 95.98%, 85.96% and 94.4%, respectively. The LoD was determined to be 10 copies/ml with all 25 replicates detected across two different runs. The clade for pangolin lineage B that contains certain distant variants, including P4715L in ORF1ab, Q57H in ORF 3a and, S84L in ORF8 covarying with the D614G spike protein mutation were the most prevalent, early in the pandemic, in Georgia, USA. In our analysis, isolates from the same county formed paraphyletic groups, which indicated virus transmission between counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study demonstrates the clinical and public health utility of the NGS-RVP to identify novel variants that can provide actionable information to prevent or mitigate emerging viral threats, models that provide insights into viral transmission patterns and predict transmission/ resurgence of regional outbreaks and provide critical information on co-circulating respiratory viruses that might be independent factors contributing to the global disease burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.24.21261046" rel="alternate" title="Respiratory Viral Sequencing Panel identifies SARS-CoV-2 variants, transmission and other co-circulating viruses in Georgia, USA: A Diagnostic and Epidemiologic Tool for Mass Surveillance in COVID-19 Pandemic (6 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.29.454261</id><title>COVID-ONE-humoral immune: The One-stop Database for COVID-19-specific Antibody Responses and Clinical Parameters (6 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.782095+00:00</updated><author><name>Zhaowei Xu</name></author><author><name>Yang Li</name></author><author><name>Qing Lei</name></author><author><name>Likun Huang</name></author><author><name>Dan-yun Lai</name></author><author><name>Shu-juan Guo</name></author><author><name>He-wei Jiang</name></author><author><name>Hongyan Hou</name></author><author><name>Yun-xiao Zheng</name></author><author><name>Xue-ning Wang</name></author><author><name>Jiaoxiang Wu</name></author><author><name>Ming-liang Ma</name></author><author><name>Bo Zhang</name></author><author><name>Hong Chen</name></author><author><name>Caizheng Yu</name></author><author><name>Jun-biao Xue</name></author><author><name>Hai-nan Zhang</name></author><author><name>Huan Qi</name></author><author><name>Siqi Yu</name></author><author><name>Mingxi Lin</name></author><author><name>Yandi Zhang</name></author><author><name>Xiaosong Lin</name></author><author><name>Zongjie Yao</name></author><author><name>Huiming Sheng</name></author><author><name>Ziyong Sun</name></author><author><name>Feng Wang</name></author><author><name>Xionglin Fan</name></author><author><name>Sheng-ce Tao</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by SARS-CoV-2, varies with regard to symptoms and mortality rates among populations. Humoral immunity plays critical roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery from COVID-19. However, differences in immune responses and clinical features among COVID-19 patients remain largely unknown. Here, we report a database for COVID-19-specific IgG/IgM immune responses and clinical parameters (COVID-ONE humoral immune). COVID-ONE humoral immunity is based on a dataset that contains the IgG/IgM responses to 21 of 28 known SARS-CoV-2 proteins and 197 spike protein peptides against 2,360 COVID-19 samples collected from 783 patients. In addition, 96 clinical parameters for the 2,360 samples and information for the 783 patients are integrated into the database. Furthermore, COVID-ONE humoral immune provides a dashboard for defining samples and a one-click analysis pipeline for a single group or paired groups. A set of samples of interest is easily defined by adjusting the scale bars of a variety of parameters. After the START button is clicked, one can readily obtain a comprehensive analysis report for further interpretation.

Spatial studies of infectious disease epidemics typically use symptomatic infections (cases) to estimate incidence rates (cases/total population), often misinterpreting them as infection risks (infections/total population) or disease risks (cases/infected population). We examined these three measures in a pediatric cohort (N≈3,000) over two chikungunya epidemics and one Zika epidemic and in a household cohort (N=1,793) over one COVID-19 epidemic in Nicaragua. Across different analyses and all epidemics, case incidence rates considerably underestimated both risk-based measures. Spatial infection risk differed from spatial disease risk, and typical case-only approaches precluded a full understanding of the spatial seroprevalence patterns. For epidemics of pathogens that cause many subclinical infections, relying on case-only datasets and misinterpreting incidence rates, as is common, results in substantial bias, a general finding applicable to many pathogens of high human concern.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.21261038" rel="alternate" title="Epidemics of chikungunya, Zika, and COVID-19 reveal bias in case-based mapping (5 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.21261039</id><title>Geographical concentration of COVID-19 cases by social determinants of health in 16 large metropolitan areas in Canada – a cross-sectional study (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.783598+00:00</updated><author><name>Yiqing Xia</name></author><author><name>Huiting Ma</name></author><author><name>Gary Moloney</name></author><author><name>Héctor A.

Studies have revealed inequalities along social determinants of health, but little investigation was conducted surrounding geographic concentration within cities. We quantified social determinants of geographic concentration of COVID-19 cases across sixteen census metropolitan areas (CMA) in four Canadian provinces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used surveillance data on confirmed COVID-19 cases at the level of dissemination area. Gini (co-Gini) coefficients were calculated by CMA based on the proportion of the population in ranks of diagnosed cases and each social determinant using census data (income, education, visible minority, recent immigration, suitable housing, and essential workers) and the corresponding share of cases. Heterogeneity was visualized using Lorenz (concentration) curves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geographic concentration was observed in all CMAs (half of the cumulative cases were concentrated among 21-35% of each city’s population): with the greatest geographic heterogeneity in Ontario CMAs (Gini coefficients, 0.32-0.47), followed by British Columbia (0.23-0.36), Manitoba (0.32), and Québec (0.28-0.37). Cases were disproportionately concentrated in areas with lower income, education attainment, and suitable housing; and higher proportion of visible minorities, recent immigrants, and essential workers. Although a consistent feature across CMAs was concentration by proportion visible minorities, the magnitude of concentration by social determinants varied across CMAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Interpretation&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature of geographical concentration of COVID-19 cases was consistent across CMAs, but the pattern by social determinants varied. Geographically-prioritized allocation of resources and services should be tailored to the local drivers of inequalities in transmission in response to SARS-CoV-2’s resurgence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.23.21261039" rel="alternate" title="Geographical concentration of COVID-19 cases by social determinants of health in 16 large metropolitan areas in Canada – a cross-sectional study (3 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.24.21261076</id><title>The U.S. COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey, 2020-2021: Continuous real-time measurement of COVID-19 symptoms, risks, protective behaviors, testing and vaccination (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.784141+00:00</updated><author><name>Joshua A.

Tibshirani</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The U.S. COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) is a large, cross-sectional, Internet-based survey that has operated continuously since April 6, 2020. By inviting a random sample of Facebook active users each day, CTIS collects information about COVID-19 symptoms, risks, mitigating behaviors, mental health, testing, vaccination, and other key priorities. The large scale of the survey – over 20 million responses in its first year of operation – allows tracking of trends over short timescales and allows comparisons at fine demographic and geographic detail. The survey has been repeatedly revised to respond to emerging public health priorities. In this paper, we describe the survey methods and content and give examples of CTIS results that illuminate key patterns and trends and help answer high-priority policy questions relevant to the COVID-19 epidemic and response. These results demonstrate how large online surveys can provide continuous, real-time indicators of important outcomes that are not subject to public health reporting delays and backlogs. The CTIS offers high value as a supplement to official reporting data by supplying essential information about behaviors, attitudes toward policy and preventive measures, economic impacts, and other topics not reported in public health surveillance systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Significance statement&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) has operated continuously since April 6, 2020, collecting over 20 million responses. The largest public health survey ever conducted in the United States, CTIS was designed to facilitate detailed demographic and geographic analyses, track trends over time, and accommodate rapid response to emerging priorities. Using examples of CTIS results illuminating trends in symptoms, risks, mitigating behaviors, testing and vaccination in relation to evolving high-priority policy questions over 12 months of the pandemic, we illustrate the value of online surveys for tracking patterns and trends in COVID outcomes as an adjunct to official reporting, and showcase unique insights that would not be visible through traditional public health reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.24.21261076" rel="alternate" title="The U.S. COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey, 2020-2021: Continuous real-time measurement of COVID-19 symptoms, risks, protective behaviors, testing and vaccination (3 tweets)"/><category term="Health Informatics"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry></feed>
