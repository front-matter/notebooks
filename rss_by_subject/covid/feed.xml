There is open discussion regarding whether low D3 is caused by the infection or if deficiency negatively affects immune defense. The aim of this study was to collect further evidence on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic literature search was performed to identify retrospective cohort as well as clinical studies on COVID-19 mortality rates versus D3 blood levels. Mortality rates from clinical studies were corrected for age, sex and diabetes. Data were analyzed using correlation and linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;One population study and seven clinical studies were identified, which reported D3 blood levels pre-infection or on the day of hospital admission. They independently showed a negative Pearson correlation of D3 levels and mortality risk (r(17)=-.4154, p=.0770/r(13)=-.4886, p=.0646). For the combined data, median (IQR) D3 levels were 23.2 ng/ml (17.4 – 26.8), and a significant Pearson correlation was observed (r(32)=-.3989, p=.0194). Regression suggested a theoretical point of zero mortality at approximately 50 ng/ml D3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two datasets provide strong evidence that low D3 is a predictor rather than a side effect of the infection. Despite ongoing vaccinations, we recommend raising serum 25(OH)D levels to above 50 ng/ml to prevent or mitigate new outbreaks due to escape mutations or decreasing antibody activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Trial registration&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not applicable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.22.21263977" rel="alternate" title="COVID-19 mortality risk correlates inversely with vitamin D3 status, and a mortality rate close to zero could theoretically be achieved at 50 ng/ml 25(OH)D3: Results of a systematic review and meta-analysis (2714 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264260</id><title>The impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on Alpha &amp; Delta variant transmission (2074 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.377975+00:00</updated><author><name>David W Eyre</name></author><author><name>Donald Taylor</name></author><author><name>Mark Purver</name></author><author><name>David Chapman</name></author><author><name>Tom Fowler</name></author><author><name>Koen B Pouwels</name></author><author><name>A Sarah Walker</name></author><author><name>Tim EA Peto</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pre-Delta, vaccination reduced transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from individuals infected despite vaccination, potentially via reducing viral loads. While vaccination still lowers the risk of infection, similar viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals infected with Delta question how much vaccination prevents onward transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We performed a retrospective observational cohort study of contacts of SARS-CoV-2-infected index cases using contact testing data from England. We used multivariable logistic regression to investigate the impact of index case and contact vaccination on transmission, and how this varies with Alpha and Delta variants (classified using S-gene detection/calendar trends) and time since second vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;51,798/139,164(37.2%) contacts tested were PCR-positive. Two doses of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 vaccines in Alpha variant index cases independently reduced PCR-positivity in contacts (aOR, adjusted odds ratio vs. unvaccinated=0.18[95%CI 0.12-0.29] and 0.37[0.22-0.63] respectively). The Delta variant attenuated vaccine-associated reductions in transmission: two BNT162b2 doses reduced Delta transmission (aOR=0.35[0.26-0.48]), more than ChAdOx1 (aOR=0.64[0.57-0.72]; heterogeneity p&amp;lt;0.001). Variation in viral load (Ct values) explained only a modest proportion of vaccine-associated transmission reductions. Transmission reductions declined over time since second vaccination, for Delta reaching similar levels to unvaccinated individuals by 12 weeks for ChAdOx1 and attenuating substantially for BNT162b2. Protection from vaccination in contacts also declined in the 3 months after second vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination reduces transmission of Delta, but by less than the Alpha variant. The impact of vaccination decreased over time. Factors other than PCR-measured viral load are important in vaccine-associated transmission reductions. Booster vaccinations may help control transmission together with preventing infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264260" rel="alternate" title="The impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on Alpha &amp; Delta variant transmission (2074 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.30.462488</id><title>Durability of immune responses to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (489 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.378183+00:00</updated><author><name>Mehul S.

However, reports of waning vaccine efficacy, coupled with the emergence of variants of concern that are resistant to antibody neutralization, have raised concerns about the potential lack of durability of immunity to vaccination. We recently reported findings from a comprehensive analysis of innate and adaptive immune responses in 56 healthy volunteers who received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccination. Here, we analyzed antibody responses to the homologous Wu strain as well as several variants of concern, including the emerging Mu (B.1.621) variant, and T cell responses in a subset of these volunteers at six months (day 210 post-primary vaccination) after the second dose. Our data demonstrate a substantial waning of antibody responses and T cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, at 6 months following the second immunization with the BNT162b2 vaccine. Notably, a significant proportion of vaccinees have neutralizing titers below the detection limit, and suggest a 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; booster immunization might be warranted to enhance the antibody titers and T cell responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.30.462488" rel="alternate" title="Durability of immune responses to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (489 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21263864</id><title>COVID-19 Vaccine Breakthrough Infections in Veterans Health Administration (475 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.411546+00:00</updated><author><name>Aditya Sharma</name></author><author><name>Gina Oda</name></author><author><name>Mark Holodniy</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been accompanied by rising concern of vaccine breakthrough due to SARS-CoV-2 variants, waning protection over time, differential vaccine effectiveness, and regional resurgence of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Characterizing the frequency and drivers of vaccine breakthrough is necessary to inform COVID-19 control efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We performed a retrospective cohort study of vaccine breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated persons in Veterans Health Administration. We applied Cox proportional hazard models to estimate cumulative incidence, assess differences in outcomes by vaccine, and identify associations with individual characteristics as well as time-dependent geographic variation in COVID-19 incidence, proportion of delta variant, and vaccine coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 3,032,561 fully vaccinated persons, documented SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 11,197 (0.37%) and COVID-19 hospitalization occurred in 2,080 (0.07%). Compared to Ad26.COV2.S, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 had lower occurrence of documented SARS-CoV-2 infection (aHR 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.58; aHR 0.36; 95% CI 0.33-0.38; respectively) and COVID-19 hospitalization (aHR 0.56, 95% CI 0.47-0.66; aHR 0.30; 0.25-0.35; respectively). Documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization were associated with younger age, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, number of comorbidities, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Regional proportion of delta variant and county-level COVID-19 incidence were predictors of vaccine breakthrough events; county-level vaccine coverage was inversely associated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine breakthrough was rare among fully vaccinated persons. mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 were more protective against documented SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization compared to Ad26.COV2.S.

However, the safety of the third (booster) dose has not been fully established yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Objective&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluate the short-term, self-reported and physiological reactions to the third BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 (booster) vaccine dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Design&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prospective observational study, in which participants are equipped with a smartwatch and fill in a daily questionnaire via a dedicated mobile application for a period of 21 days, starting seven days before the vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Setting&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Israel-wide third (booster) vaccination campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Participants&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of 1,609 (18+ years of age) recipients of at least one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine between December 20, 2020, and September 15, 2021, out of a larger cohort of 2,912 prospective study participants. 1,344 of the participants were recipients of the third vaccine dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Measurements&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily self-reported questionnaires regarding local and systemic reactions, mood level, stress level, sport duration, and sleep quality. Heart rate, heart rate variability and blood oxygen saturation level were continuously measured by Garmin Vivosmart 4 smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extent of systemic reactions reported following the third (booster) dose administration is similar to that reported following the second dose (p-value=0.305) and considerably greater than that reported following the first dose (p-value&amp;lt;0.001). Our analyses of self-reported well-being indicators as well as the objective heart rate and heart rate variability measures recorded by the smartwatches further support this finding. Focusing on the third dose, reactions were more apparent in younger participants (p-value&amp;lt;0.01), in women (p-value&amp;lt;0.001), and in participants with no underlying medical conditions (p-value&amp;lt;0.001).

Indeed, it has been suggested that the death rate in developing countries may be far lower than in high-income countries—an outcome that would be starkly different from the typical pattern for many other infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We systematically reviewed the literature to identify all serology studies in developing countries that were conducted using representative samples of specimens collected by early 2021. For each of the antibody assays used in these serology studies, we identified data on assay characteristics, including the extent of seroreversion over time. We analyzed the serology data using a Bayesian model that incorporates conventional sampling uncertainty as well as uncertainties about assay sensitivity and specificity. We then calculated IFRs using individual case reports or aggregated public health updates, including age-specific estimates whenever feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seroprevalence in many developing country locations was markedly higher than in high-income countries but still far short of herd immunity. In most locations, seroprevalence among older adults was similar to that of younger age-groups. Age-specific IFRs were 1.3-2.5x higher than in high-income countries. The median value of population IFR was 0.5% among developing countries with satisfactory death reporting as of 2016, compared to a median of 0.05% for other developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The burden of COVID-19 is far higher in developing countries than in high-income countries, reflecting a combination of elevated transmission to middle-aged and older adults as well as limited access to adequate healthcare. These results underscore the critical need to accelerate the provision of vaccine doses to vulnerable populations in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Key Points&lt;/title&gt;&lt;list list-type="simple"&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;label&gt;‐&lt;/label&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age-specific prevalence and infection fatality rate (IFR) of COVID-19 for developing countries has not been well assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;label&gt;‐&lt;/label&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seroprevalence in developing countries (as measured by antibodies against SARS-CoV-2) is markedly higher than in high-income countries but still far short of herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;label&gt;‐&lt;/label&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seroprevalence among older adults is broadly similar to that of younger age-groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;label&gt;‐&lt;/label&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age-specific IFRs in developing countries are roughly twice those of high-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;label&gt;‐&lt;/label&gt;&lt;p&gt;Population IFR in developing countries with satisfactory death reporting (based on UN/WHO data as of 2016) is ten times higher than in other developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;label&gt;‐&lt;/label&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results underscore the urgency of disseminating vaccines to vulnerable people in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.21264325" rel="alternate" title="Assessing the Burden of COVID-19 in Developing Countries: Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, and Public Policy Implications (264 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.30.21264363</id><title>SARS-CoV-2 infections elicit higher levels of original antigenic sin antibodies compared to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations (230 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.593973+00:00</updated><author><name>Elizabeth M.

Here, we characterized the magnitude and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 spike-reactive antibodies from 10 acutely infected health care workers and 23 participants who received mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We found that infection and primary mRNA vaccination elicited S1 and S2-reactive antibodies, while secondary vaccination boosted mostly S1 antibodies. Using magnetic bead-based absorption assays, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infections elicited a large proportion of original antigenic sin-like antibodies that bound efficiently to common seasonal human coronaviruses but poorly to SARS-CoV-2.

As in the human disease, monocytes, and macrophages in SARS-CoV-2 infected MISTRG6-hACE2 are central to disease pathology. Here, we describe SARS-CoV-2 uptake in tissue resident human macrophages that is enhanced by virus specific antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 replicates in these human macrophages as evidenced by detection of double-stranded RNA, subgenomic viral RNA and expression of a virally encoded fluorescent reporter gene; and it is inhibited by Remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral replication. Although early IFN deficiency leads to enhanced disease, blocking either viral replication with Remdesivir or the downstream IFN stimulated cascade by injecting anti-IFNAR2 &lt;italic&gt;in vivo&lt;/italic&gt; in the chronic stages of disease attenuates many aspects of the overactive immune-inflammatory response, especially the inflammatory macrophage response, and most consequentially, the chronic disease itself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.461948" rel="alternate" title="Viral replication in human macrophages enhances an inflammatory cascade and interferon driven chronic COVID-19 in humanized mice (176 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.21264272</id><title>Associations between SARS-CoV-2 variants and risk of COVID-19 hospitalization among confirmed cases in Washington State: a retrospective cohort study (175 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.650345+00:00</updated><author><name>Miguel I.

Using a retrospective cohort study, we assessed the risk of hospitalization following infection with nine variants of concern or interest (VOC/VOI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study includes individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in the Washington Disease Reporting System and with available viral genome data, from December 1, 2020 to July 30, 2021. The main analysis was restricted to cases with specimens collected through sentinel surveillance. Using a Cox proportional hazards model with mixed effects, we estimated hazard ratios (HR) for the risk of hospitalization following infection with a VOC/VOI, adjusting for age, sex, and vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Findings&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 27,814 cases, 23,170 (83.3%) were sequenced through sentinel surveillance, of which 726 (3.1%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19. Higher hospitalization risk was found for infections with Gamma (HR 3.17, 95% CI 2.15-4.67), Beta (HR: 2.97, 95% CI 1.65–5.35), Delta (HR: 2.30, 95% CI 1.69-3.15), and Alpha (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.26–1.99) compared to infections with an ancestral lineage. Following VOC infection, unvaccinated patients show a similar higher hospitalization risk, while vaccinated patients show no significant difference in risk, both when compared to unvaccinated, ancestral lineage cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Interpretation&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infection with a VOC results in a higher hospitalization risk, with an active vaccination attenuating that risk. Our findings support promoting hospital preparedness, vaccination, and robust genomic surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.21264272" rel="alternate" title="Associations between SARS-CoV-2 variants and risk of COVID-19 hospitalization among confirmed cases in Washington State: a retrospective cohort study (175 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.21264163</id><title>Four SARS-CoV-2 vaccines induce quantitatively different antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants (172 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.652213+00:00</updated><author><name>Marit J. van Gils</name></author><author><name>A.

We performed a head-to-head comparison of the ability of sera from individuals vaccinated with either one of four vaccines (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, AZD1222 or Ad26.COV2.S) to recognize and neutralize the four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs; Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta). Four weeks after completing the vaccination series, SARS-CoV-2 wild-type neutralizing antibody titers were highest in recipients of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 (median titers of 1891 and 3061, respectively), and substantially lower in those vaccinated with the adenovirus vector-based vaccines AZD1222 and Ad26.COV2.S (median titers of 241 and 119, respectively). VOCs neutralization was reduced in all vaccine groups, with the largest (5.8-fold) reduction in neutralization being observed against the Beta variant.

One variant may escape immunity elicited by another, and the delta VOC has been reported to escape beta elicited immunity (1). Systematic mapping of the serological distance of current and emerging variants will likely guide the design of vaccines which can target all variants. Here we isolated and serologically characterized SARS-CoV-2 which evolved from an ancestral strain in a person with advanced HIV disease and delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance. This virus showed evolving escape from self antibody neutralization immunity and decreased Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine neutralization sensitivity. We mapped neutralization of evolved virus and ancestral, beta and delta variant viruses by antibodies elicited by each VOC in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals. Beta virus showed moderate (7-fold) and delta slight escape from neutralizing immunity elicited by ancestral virus infection. In contrast, delta virus had stronger escape from beta elicited immunity (12-fold), and beta virus even stronger escape from delta immunity (34-fold). Evolved virus had 9-fold escape from ancestral immunity, 27-fold escape from delta immunity, but was effectively neutralized by beta immunity. We conclude that beta and delta are serologically distant, further than each is from ancestral, and that virus evolved in prolonged infection during advanced HIV disease is serologically close to beta and far from delta. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is diverging into distinct serological phenotypes and that vaccines tailored to one variant may become vulnerable to infections with another.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.14.21263564" rel="alternate" title="Divergence of delta and beta variants and SARS-CoV-2 evolved in prolonged infection into distinct serological phenotypes (72 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.16.21263642</id><title>Face mask fit modifications that improve source control performance (67 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.656161+00:00</updated><author><name>Francoise M.

Modifications such as mask braces, earloop straps, knotting and tucking, and double masking have been proposed to improve mask fit. However, the data on source control are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;METHODS&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of mask fit modifications was determined by conducting fit tests on human subjects and simulator manikins and by performing simulated coughs and exhalations using a source control measurement system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;RESULTS&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical masks without modification blocked ≥56% of cough aerosols and ≥42% of exhaled aerosols. Modifying fit by crossing the earloops or placing a bracket under the mask did not increase performance, while using earloop toggles, an earloop strap, and knotting and tucking the mask increased performance. The most effective modifications for improving source control performance were double masking and using a mask brace. Placing a cloth mask over a medical mask blocked ≥85% of cough aerosols and ≥91% of exhaled aerosols.

These impacts are less well understood in low-and middle-income countries, where mortality surveillance before the pandemic was patchy. Although limited all-cause mortality data are available in India, interpreting this data remains a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Objective&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use existing data on all-cause mortality from civil registration systems of twelve Indian states comprising around 60% of the national population to understand the scale and timing of excess deaths in India during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We characterize the available data, discuss the various reasons why these data are incomplete, and estimate the extent of coverage in the data. Comparing the pandemic period to 2019, we estimate excess mortality in twelve Indian states, and extrapolate our estimates to the rest of India. We explore sensitivity of the estimates to various assumptions, and present optimistic and pessimistic scenarios along with our central estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 12 states with available all-cause mortality data, we document an increase of 28% in deaths during April 2020-May 2021 relative to expectations from 2019. This level of increase in mortality, if it applies nationally, would imply 2.8-2.9 million excess deaths. More limited data from June 2021 increases national estimates of excess deaths during April 2020-June 2021 to 3.8 million. With more optimistic or pessimistic assumptions, excess deaths during this period could credibly lie between 2.8 million and 5.2 million. We find that the scale of estimated excess deaths is broadly consistent with expectations based on seroprevalence data and international data on COVID-19 fatality rates. Moreover, there is a strong association between the timing of excess deaths, and of recorded COVID-19 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Contribution&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that the surveillance of pandemic mortality in India has been extremely poor, with around 8-10 times as many excess deaths as officially recorded COVID-19 deaths. Our findings highlight the utility of all-cause mortality data, as well as the significant challenges in interpreting such data from LMICs. These data reveal that India is among the countries most severely impacted by the pandemic. It is likely that in absolute terms India has seen the highest number of pandemic excess deaths of any country in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.30.21264376" rel="alternate" title="Estimates of pandemic excess mortality in India based on civil registration data (47 tweets)"/><category term="Public and Global Health"/><published>2021-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.25.21263542</id><title>COVID-19 attack ratio among children critically depends on the time to removal and activity levels (46 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.657740+00:00</updated><author><name>Jianhong Wu</name></author><author><name>Nicola Luigi Bragazzi</name></author><author><name>Francesca Scarabel</name></author><author><name>Zachary McCarthy</name></author><author><name>Jummy David</name></author><author><name> </name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The attack ratio in a subpopulation is defined as the total number of infections over the total number of individuals in this subpopulation.

We describe the relationship between this attack ratio among children, the time to remove infected individuals from the transmission chain and the children-to-children daily contact rate, while considering the increased transmissibility of virus variants (using the Delta variant as an example). We further illustrate the generality and applicability of the methodology established by performing an analysis of the attack ratio of COVID-19 among children in the Canadian population. The clinical attack ratio, the number of symptomatic infections over the total population can be informed from the attack ratio, and both can be reduced substantially via a combination of higher vaccine coverage in the vaccine eligible population, reduced social mixing among children, and rapid testing and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.25.21263542" rel="alternate" title="COVID-19 attack ratio among children critically depends on the time to removal and activity levels (46 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.17.21263549</id><title>A systematic review of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease (44 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.659560+00:00</updated><author><name>Melissa M Higdon</name></author><author><name>Brian Wahl</name></author><author><name>Carli B Jones</name></author><author><name>Joseph G Rosen</name></author><author><name>Shaun A Truelove</name></author><author><name>Anurima Baidya</name></author><author><name>Anjalika A Nande</name></author><author><name>Parisa A ShamaeiZadeh</name></author><author><name>Karoline K Walter</name></author><author><name>Daniel R Feikin</name></author><author><name>Minal K Patel</name></author><author><name>Maria Deloria Knoll</name></author><author><name>Alison L Hill</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Billions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered around the world, dramatically reducing SARS-CoV-2 incidence in some settings.

Vaccine metrics collected include effects against asymptomatic infection, any infection, symptomatic COVID-19, and severe outcomes including hospitalization and death, for both partial and complete vaccination, and against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. In addition, we review the epidemiological principles behind the design and interpretation of vaccine effects and explain important sources of heterogeneity between studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.17.21263549" rel="alternate" title="A systematic review of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease (44 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.25.21264097</id><title>Age-Specific Changes in Virulence Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (36 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.661302+00:00</updated><author><name>David N.

Tuite</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novel variants of concern (VOCs) have been associated with both increased infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. The virulence of SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to age. Whether relative increases in virulence of novel VOCs is similar across the age spectrum, or is limited to some age groups, is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontario, Canada testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between February 7 and August 30, 2021 (n=233,799). Cases were classified as N501Y-positive VOC, probable Delta VOC, or VOC undetected. We constructed age-specific logistic regression models to evaluate the effects of N501Y-postive or Delta VOC infections on infection severity, using hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death as outcome variables. Models were adjusted for sex, time, health unit, vaccination status, comorbidities, immune compromise, long-term care residence, healthcare worker status, and pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infection with either N501Y-positive or Delta VOCs was associated with significant elevations in risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death in younger and older adults, compared to infections where a VOC was not detected. Delta VOC increased hospitalization risk in children under 10 by a factor of 2.5 (adjusted odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: 1.2 to 5.1) compared to non-VOC. For most VOC-outcome combinations there was no heterogeneity in adverse outcomes by age. However, there was an inverse relationship between age and relative increase in risk of death with delta VOC, with younger age groups showing a greater relative increase in risk of death than older individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Interpretation&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 VOCs appear to be associated with increased relative virulence of infection in all age groups, though low absolute numbers of outcomes in younger individuals make estimates in these groups imprecise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.25.21264097" rel="alternate" title="Age-Specific Changes in Virulence Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (36 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21263801</id><title>Analysis of overdispersion in airborne transmission of Covid-19 (33 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.662657+00:00</updated><author><name>Swetaprovo Chaudhuri</name></author><author><name>Prasad Kasibhatla</name></author><author><name>Arnab Mukherjee</name></author><author><name>William Pan</name></author><author><name>Glenn Morrison</name></author><author><name>Sharmistha Mishra</name></author><author><name>Vijaya Kumar Murty</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Superspreading events and overdispersion are hallmarks of the Covid-19 pandemic. To gain insight into the nature and controlling factors of these superspreading events and heterogeneity in transmission, we conducted mechanistic modeling of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by infectious aerosols using real-world occupancy data from a large number of full-service restaurants in ten US metropolises. Including a large number of factors that influence disease transmission in these settings, we demonstrate the emergence of a stretched tail in the probability density function of secondary infection numbers indicating strong heterogeneity in individual infectivity. Derived analytical results further demonstrate that variability in viral loads and variability in occupancy, together, lead to overdispersion in the number of secondary infections arising from individual index cases. Our analysis, connecting mechanistic understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by aerosols with observed large-scale epidemiological characteristics of Covid-19 outbreaks, adds an important dimension to the mounting body of evidence with regards to the determinants of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by aerosols in indoor settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21263801" rel="alternate" title="Analysis of overdispersion in airborne transmission of Covid-19 (33 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.21.21263915</id><title>Impact of vaccine hesitancy on secondary COVID-19 outbreaks in the US (29 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.663250+00:00</updated><author><name>Alfonso de Miguel Arribas</name></author><author><name>Alberto Aleta</name></author><author><name>Yamir Moreno</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 outbreak has become the worst pandemic in at least a century. To fight this disease, a global effort led to the development of several vaccines at an unprecedented rate. There have been, however, several logistic issues with its deployment, from their production and transport, to the hesitancy of the population to be vaccinated. For different reasons, an important amount of individuals is reluctant to get the vaccine, something that hinders our ability to control and - eventually - eradicate the disease. In this work, we analyze the impact that this hesitancy might have in a context in which a more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern spreads through a partially vaccinated population. We use age-stratified data from surveys on vaccination acceptance, together with age-contact matrices to inform an age-structured SIR model set in the US. Our results clearly show that higher vaccine hesitancy ratios led to larger outbreaks. A closer inspection of the stratified infection rates also reveals the important role played by the youngest groups. Our results could shed some light on the role that hesitancy will play in the near future and inform policy-makers and the general public of the importance of reducing it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.21.21263915" rel="alternate" title="Impact of vaccine hesitancy on secondary COVID-19 outbreaks in the US (29 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-09-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.462326</id><title>Metabolic snapshot of plasma samples reveals new pathways implicated in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis (29 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.665685+00:00</updated><author><name>Oihane E.

Variations in the metabolic reaction to SARS-CoV-2 infection could explain the striking differences in the susceptibility to infection and the risk of severe disease. Here, we used untargeted metabolomics to examine novel metabolic pathways related to SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 clinical severity using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (CE-TOF-MS) in plasma samples. We included 27 patients with confirmed COVID-19 early after symptom onset who were prospectively followed and 29 healthcare workers heavily exposed to SARS-CoV-2 but with low susceptibility to infection (‘nonsusceptible’). We found that the metabolite profile was predictive of the study group. We identified a total of 55 metabolites as biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or COVID-19 clinical severity. We report the discovery of new plasma biomarkers for COVID-19 that provide mechanistic explanations for the clinical consequences of SARS-CoV-2, including mitochondrial and liver dysfunction as a consequence of hypoxemia (citrulline, citrate, and BAIBA), energy production and amino acid catabolism (L-glycine, L-alanine, L-serine, L-proline, L-aspartic acid and L-histidine), endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis (citrulline, L-ADMA, 2-AB, and Neu5Ac), and we found interconnections between these pathways. In summary, in this first report of the metabolomic profile of individuals with severe COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility by CE-MS, we define several metabolic pathways implicated in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 clinical progression that could be developed as biomarkers of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.462326" rel="alternate" title="Metabolic snapshot of plasma samples reveals new pathways implicated in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis (29 tweets)"/><category term="Biochemistry"/><published>2021-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.22.21263998</id><title>Risk factors associated with development and persistence of long COVID (27 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.668590+00:00</updated><author><name>Yusuke Miyazato</name></author><author><name>Shinya Tsuzuki</name></author><author><name>Shinichiro Morioka</name></author><author><name>Mari Terda</name></author><author><name>Satoshi Kutsuna</name></author><author><name>Sho Saito</name></author><author><name>Yumiko Shimanishi</name></author><author><name>Kozue Takahashi</name></author><author><name>Mio Sanada</name></author><author><name>Masako Akashi</name></author><author><name>Chika Kuge</name></author><author><name>Yasuyo Osanai</name></author><author><name>Keiko Tanaka</name></author><author><name>Michiyo Suzuki</name></author><author><name>Kayoko Hayakawa</name></author><author><name>Norio Ohmagari</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long COVID has been a social concern.

Demographic and clinical data, and the presence and duration of long COVID were obtained. We identified factors associated with development and persistence of long COVID using multivariate logistic and linear regression analysis, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed 457 of 526 responses (response rate, 86.9%). The median age was 47 years, and 378 patients (84.4%) had mild disease in acute phase. The number of patients with any symptoms after 6 and 12 months after onset or diagnosis were 120 (26.3%) and 40 (8.8%), respectively. Women were at risk for development of fatigue (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.31-3.14), dysosmia (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.24-2.93), dysgeusia (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.02-2.39), and hair loss (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.77-5.09), and were at risk for persistence of any symptoms (coefficient 38.0, 95% CI 13.3-62.8). Younger age and low body mass index were risk factors for developing dysosmia (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.98, and OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.99, respectively) and dysgeusia (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-1.00, and OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.98, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified risk factors for the persistence as well as development of long COVID.

The hypothesis for the time to recovery endpoint is evaluated first, and if superiority is declared on time to recovery, the hypothesis for the second co-primary endpoint of hospitalisation/death is then evaluated. To determine futility, we pre-specified a clinically meaningful benefit in time to first reported recovery as a hazard ratio of 1.2 or larger (equating to approximately 1.5 days benefit in the colchicine arm, assuming 9 days recovery in the usual care arm).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial opened on April 2, 2020, with randomisation to colchicine starting on March 04, 2021 and stopping on May 26, 2021, because the pre-specified time to recovery futility criterion was met. The primary analysis model included 2755 SARS-CoV-2 positive participants, randomised to colchicine (n=156), usual care (n=1145), and other treatments (n=1454). Time to first self-reported recovery was similar in the colchicine group compared with usual care with an estimated hazard ratio of 0.919 [95% credible interval 0.72 to 1.16] and an estimated increase of 1.14 days [−1.86 to 5.21] in median time to self-reported recovery for colchicine versus usual care. The probability of meaningful benefit in time to recovery was very low at 1.8%. Results were similar in comparisons with concurrent controls. COVID-19 related hospitalisations/deaths were similar in the colchicine group versus usual care, with an estimated odds ratio of 0.76 [0.28 to 1.89] and an estimated difference of −0.4% [−2.7% to 2.4]. One serious adverse event occurred in the colchicine group and one in usual care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colchicine did not improve time to recovery in people at higher risk of complications with COVID-19 in the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Trial registration&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISRCTN86534580.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.20.21263828" rel="alternate" title="Colchicine for COVID-19 in adults in the community (PRINCIPLE): a randomised, controlled, adaptive platform trial (26 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.21.21258385</id><title>Using genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 to support contact tracing and public health surveillance in rural Humboldt County, California (23 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.672162+00:00</updated><author><name>Gunnar Stoddard</name></author><author><name>Allison Black</name></author><author><name>Patrick Ayscue</name></author><author><name>Dan Lu</name></author><author><name>Jack Kamm</name></author><author><name>Karan Bhatt</name></author><author><name>Lienna Chan</name></author><author><name>Amy L Kistler</name></author><author><name>Joshua Batson</name></author><author><name>Angela Detweiler</name></author><author><name>Michelle Tan</name></author><author><name>Norma Neff</name></author><author><name>Joseph L DeRisi</name></author><author><name>Jeremy Corrigan</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;During the COVID-19 pandemic within the United States, much of the responsibility for diagnostic testing and epidemiologic response has relied on the action of county-level departments of public health. Here we describe the integration of genomic surveillance into epidemiologic response within Humboldt County, a rural county in northwest California. Through a collaborative effort, 853 whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes were generated, representing ∼58% of the 1,449 SARS-CoV-2-positive cases detected in Humboldt County as of mid-March 2021. Phylogenetic analysis of these data was used to develop a comprehensive understanding of SARS-CoV-2 introductions to the county and to support contact tracing and epidemiologic investigations of all large outbreaks in the county. In the case of an outbreak on a commercial farm, viral genomic data were used to validate reported epidemiologic links and link additional cases within the community who did not report a farm exposure to the outbreak. During a separate outbreak within a skilled nursing facility, genomic surveillance data were used to rule out the putative index case, detect the emergence of an independent Spike:N501Y substitution, and verify that the outbreak had been brought under control. These use cases demonstrate how developing genomic surveillance capacity within local public health departments can support timely and responsive deployment of genomic epidemiology for surveillance and outbreak response based on local needs and priorities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.21.21258385" rel="alternate" title="Using genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 to support contact tracing and public health surveillance in rural Humboldt County, California (23 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.26.21264145</id><title>Racial and ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality within Texas carceral settings (22 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.673432+00:00</updated><author><name>Neal Marquez</name></author><author><name>Destiny Moreno</name></author><author><name>Amanda Klonsky</name></author><author><name>Sharon Dolovich</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Several analyses have highlighted racial and ethnic disparities related to COVID-19 health outcomes across the United States. Less focus has been placed on more localized contexts, such as carceral settings, where racial and ethnic inequities in COVID-19 health outcomes also exist, but the proximal drivers of inequality are different. In this study, we analyzed mortality rates among incarcerated people in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) to assess racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 mortality. We obtained monthly demographic and mortality information of the TDCJ population from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2021 from TDCJ monthly reports and open record requests filed by the Texas Justice Initiative. We estimated the risk of COVID-19 mortality for the Hispanic and Black population relative to the White population using a Bayesian regression framework, adjusting for sex and age. In the first 12 months of the pandemic, Hispanic and Black all-cause mortality rates were higher than that of the White population, reversing the pattern observed the 12 months prior. Adjusted risk of COVID-19 mortality relative to the White population was 1.96 (CI 1.32–2.93) for the Hispanic population and 1.66 (CI 1.10–2.52) for the Black population. We find that COVID-19 mortality has disproportionately impacted Hispanic and Black individuals within the TDCJ population. As the proximal mechanisms which drive these inequalities are likely different than those which lead to racial inequalities in the non-incarcerated populations, future studies should look to assess and address the specific drivers of COVID-19 related disparities in carceral settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.26.21264145" rel="alternate" title="Racial and ethnic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality within Texas carceral settings (22 tweets)"/><category term="Public and Global Health"/><published>2021-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.21.21263740</id><title>The Pandemic Brain: neuroinflammation in healthy, non-infected individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic (22 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.674243+00:00</updated><author><name>Ludovica Brusaferri</name></author><author><name>Zeynab Alshelh</name></author><author><name>Daniel Martins</name></author><author><name>Minhae Kim</name></author><author><name>Akila Weerasekera</name></author><author><name>Hope Housman</name></author><author><name>Erin J.

In fact, accumulating evidence indicates a global increase in the incidence of fatigue, brain fog and depression, including among non-infected, since the pandemic onset. Motivated by previous evidence linking those symptoms to neuroimmune activation in other pathological contexts, we hypothesized that subjects examined after the enforcement of lockdown/stay-at-home measures would demonstrate increased neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We performed simultaneous brain Positron Emission Tomography / Magnetic Resonance Imaging in healthy volunteers either before (n=57) or after (n=15) the 2020 Massachusetts lockdown, using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28, a radioligand for the glial marker 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO). First, we compared [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 signal across pre- and post-lockdown cohorts. Then, we evaluated the link between neuroinflammatory signals and scores on a questionnaire assessing mental and physical impacts of the pandemic. Further, we investigated multivariate associations between the spatial pattern of [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 post-lockdown changes and constitutive brain gene expression in &lt;italic&gt;post-mortem&lt;/italic&gt; brains (Allen Human Brain Atlas). Finally, in a subset (n=13 pre-lockdown; n=11 post-lockdown), we also used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify brain (thalamic) levels of myoinositol (mIns), another neuroinflammatory marker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Findings&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PBR28 and mIns signals were overall stable pre-lockdown, but markedly elevated after lockdown, including within brain regions previously implicated in stress, depression and “sickness behaviors”.

A bottleneck in the application of basic research findings to patients is the enormous cost, time, and effort required for high-throughput screening of potential drugs&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for given therapeutic targets. Recent advances in 3D docking simulations have not solved this problem, given that 3D protein structures with sufficient resolution are not always available and that they are computationally expensive to obtain. Here we have developed LIGHTHOUSE, a graph-based deep learning approach for discovery of the hidden principles underlying the association of small-molecule compounds with target proteins, and we present its validation by identifying potential therapeutic compounds for various human diseases. Without any 3D structural information for proteins or chemicals, LIGHTHOUSE estimates protein-compound scores that incorporate known evolutionary relations and available experimental data. It identified novel therapeutics for cancer, lifestyle-related disease, and bacterial infection. Moreover, LIGHTHOUSE predicted ethoxzolamide as a therapeutic for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and this agent was indeed effective against alpha, beta, gamma, and delta variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that are rampant worldwide. Given that ethoxzolamide is already approved for several diseases, it could be rapidly deployed for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. We envision that LIGHTHOUSE will bring about a paradigm shift in translational medicine, providing a bridge from bench side to bedside.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.25.461785" rel="alternate" title="LIGHTHOUSE illuminates therapeutics for a variety of diseases including COVID-19 (22 tweets)"/><category term="Systems Biology"/><published>2021-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21264018</id><title>Rapid replacement of the Beta variant by the Delta variant in South Africa (21 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.675885+00:00</updated><author><name>Houriiyah Tegally</name></author><author><name>Eduan Wilkinson</name></author><author><name>Christian L.

Here we show rapid replacement of the Beta variant by the Delta variant, a highly transmissible variant of concern (VOC) that emerged in India and subsequently spread around the world. The Delta variant was imported to South Africa primarily from India, spread rapidly in large monophyletic clusters to all provinces, and became dominant within three months of introduction. This was associated with a resurgence in community transmission, leading to a third wave which was associated with a high number of deaths. We estimated a growth advantage for the Delta variant in South Africa of 0.089 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.084-0.093) per day which corresponds to a transmission advantage of 46% (95% CI 44-48) compared to the Beta variant. These data provide additional support for the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant relative to other VOC and highlight how dynamic shifts in the distribution of variants contribute to the ongoing public health threat.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21264018" rel="alternate" title="Rapid replacement of the Beta variant by the Delta variant in South Africa (21 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.24.21263853</id><title>Multi-omics approach identifies novel age-, time- and treatment-related immunopathological signatures in MIS-C and pediatric COVID-19 (21 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.683601+00:00</updated><author><name>Keith Sacco</name></author><author><name>Riccardo Castagnoli</name></author><author><name>Svetlana Vakkilainen</name></author><author><name>Can Liu</name></author><author><name>Ottavia M.

In this longitudinal multi-institutional study, we used multi-omics to identify novel time- and treatment-related immunopathological signatures in children with COVID-19 (n=105) and MIS-C (n=76). pCOVID-19 was characterized by enhanced type I IFN responses, and MIS-C by type II IFN- and NF-κB dependent responses, matrisome activation, and increased levels of Spike protein. Reduced levels of IL-33 in pCOVID-19, and of CCL22 in MIS-C suggested suppression of Th2 responses. Expansion of &lt;italic&gt;TRBV11-2&lt;/italic&gt; T-cell clonotypes in MIS-C was associated with inflammation and signatures of T-cell activation, and was reversed by glucocorticoids. The association of MIS-C with the combination of HLA A*02, B*35, C*04 alleles suggests genetic susceptibility. MIS-C B cells showed higher mutation load. Use of IVIG was identified as a confounding factor in the interpretation of autoantibody levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.24.21263853" rel="alternate" title="Multi-omics approach identifies novel age-, time- and treatment-related immunopathological signatures in MIS-C and pediatric COVID-19 (21 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264207</id><title>Durability of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (AZD1222) vaccination in people living with HIV - responses to SARS-CoV-2, variants of concern and circulating coronaviruses (20 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.745036+00:00</updated><author><name>Ane Ogbe</name></author><author><name>Mathew Pace</name></author><author><name>Mustapha Bittaye</name></author><author><name>Timothy Tipoe</name></author><author><name>Sandra Adele</name></author><author><name>Jasmini Alagaratnam</name></author><author><name>Parvinder K Aley</name></author><author><name>M.

Responses to vaccination were determined by serology (IgG ELISA and MesoScale Discovery (MSD)), neutralisation, ACE-2 inhibition, gamma interferon ELISpot, activation-induced marker (AIM) assay and T cell proliferation. We show that 6 months after vaccination the majority of measurable immune responses were greater than pre-vaccination baseline, but with evidence of a decline in both humoral and cell mediated immunity. There was, however, no significant difference compared to a cohort of HIV-uninfected individuals vaccinated with the same regimen. Responses to the variants of concern were detectable, although were lower than wild type. Pre-existing cross-reactive T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike were associated with greater post-vaccine immunity and correlated with prior exposure to beta coronaviruses. These data support the on-going policy to vaccinate PWH against SARS-CoV-2, and underpin the need for long-term monitoring of responses after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264207" rel="alternate" title="Durability of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (AZD1222) vaccination in people living with HIV - responses to SARS-CoV-2, variants of concern and circulating coronaviruses (20 tweets)"/><category term="HIV/AIDS"/><published>2021-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.30.462449</id><title>Pyronaridine Protects Against SARS-CoV-2 in Mouse (18 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.747919+00:00</updated><author><name>Ana C.

One of these is remdesivir, which was originally repurposed from its use against Ebola and functions by causing early RNA chain termination. We used this as justification to evaluate three molecules we had previously identified computationally with antiviral activity against Ebola and Marburg. Out of these we previously identified pyronaridine, which inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 replication in A549-ACE2 cells. Herein, the &lt;italic&gt;in vivo&lt;/italic&gt; efficacy of pyronaridine has now been assessed in a K18-hACE transgenic mouse model of COVID-19. Pyronaridine treatment demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of viral load in the lungs of SARS CoV-2 infected mice. Furthermore, the pyronaridine treated group reduced lung pathology, which was also associated with significant reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokine and cell infiltration. Notably, pyronaridine inhibited the viral PL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; activity &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt; (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.8 µM) without any effect on M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;, indicating a possible molecular mechanism involved in its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Interestingly, pyronaridine also selectively inhibits the host kinase CAMK1 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 2.4 µM). We have also generated several pyronaridine analogs to assist in understanding the structure activity relationship for PL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; inhibition. Our results indicate that pyronaridine is a potential therapeutic candidate for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;One sentence summary&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently intense interest in discovering small molecules with direct antiviral activity against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). Pyronaridine, an antiviral drug with in vitro activity against Ebola, Marburg and SARS-CoV-2 has now statistically significantly reduced the viral load in mice along with IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-β ultimately demonstrating a protective effect against lung damage by infection to provide a new potential treatment for testing clinically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.30.462449" rel="alternate" title="Pyronaridine Protects Against SARS-CoV-2 in Mouse (18 tweets)"/><category term="Pharmacology and Toxicology"/><published>2021-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.21264194</id><title>SARS-Cov-2 Infection versus Vaccine-Induced Immunity among Veterans (17 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.749166+00:00</updated><author><name>Yinong Young-Xu</name></author><author><name>Jeremy Smith</name></author><author><name>Caroline Korves</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;With over 40 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection reported in the US and discussion of both vaccine mandates as well as boosters ongoing, we aim to examine protection conferred by previous infection compared with vaccination so that citizens and policy makers can make informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Objectives&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compare mRNA COVID-19 vaccine-induced immunity against immunity induced by previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 between June and August 2021 when the Delta variant became dominant in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective observational study comparing two groups whose incident vaccination or infection occurred within the first two months of 2021: (1) SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals who received a full mRNA vaccination - 2 doses of either Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, (2) newly infected individuals who were subdivided into those have not been vaccinated and those have been vaccinated after their infection. Matched multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was applied. We evaluated laboratory (RT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during follow-up, COVID-related hospitalization, and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Setting&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veterans Health Administration (VHA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Main outcomes&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, COVID-related hospitalization, and deaths. Protection was estimated from hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 9,539 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first two months of 2021 were matched to 14,458 and 23,105 patients fully vaccinated with Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines, during the same two months. 3,917 (41%) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were subsequently vaccinated. We plan to study this group separately. Consequently, protections were estimated among those with infection but were not subsequently vaccinated and those vaccinated with a mRNA vaccine. Among seniors, Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines offered stronger protection against infection, lowering the risk by an additional 66% [HR: 0.34 (95% CI, 0.14-0.78)] and 68% [HR: 0.32 (95% CI, 0.14-0.70)]; stronger protection against hospitalization, lowering the risk by an additional 61% [HR: 0.34 (95% CI, 0.14-0.78)] and 45% [HR: 0.34 (95% CI, 0.14-0.78)]; and stronger protection against deaths lowering the risk by an additional 95% [HR: 0.05 (95% CI, 0.004-0.62)] and 99% [HR: 0.01 (95% CI, 0.001-0.44)]. Among young adults (age &amp;lt; 65), the protections offered by vaccines were statistically equivalent to that provided by previous infection, especially in terms of absolute incidence rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the elderly (age 65 or older), two-dose mRNA vaccines provided stronger protection against infection, hospitalization, and death, compared to natural immunity.

QALY losses appear to be particularly large for closures of schools and daycares as well as restaurants and bars, and seem relatively small for wearing masks in public and closure of fitness facilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.21.21263825" rel="alternate" title="Global Burden of Covid-19 Restrictions: National, Regional and Global Estimates (16 tweets)"/><category term="Health Economics"/><published>2021-09-28T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.24.461743</id><title>Caspase-4/11 exacerbates disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection by promoting inflammation and thrombosis (16 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.749528+00:00</updated><author><name>Mostafa Eltobgy</name></author><author><name>Ashley Zani</name></author><author><name>Adam D.

Targeting inflammatory innate immunity pathways holds therapeutic promise, but effective molecular targets remain elusive. Here, we show that human caspase-4 (CASP4), and its mouse homologue, caspase-11 (CASP11), are upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infections, and that &lt;italic&gt;CASP4&lt;/italic&gt; expression correlates with severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. SARS-CoV-2-infected &lt;italic&gt;Casp11&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice were protected from severe weight loss and lung pathology, including blood vessel damage, compared to wild-type (WT) and gasdermin-D knock out (&lt;italic&gt;Gsdmd&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;italic&gt;-/-&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;italic&gt;)&lt;/italic&gt; mice. GSDMD is a downstream effector of CASP11 and CASP1. Notably, viral titers were similar in the three genotypes. Global transcriptomics of SARS-CoV-2-infected WT, &lt;italic&gt;Casp11&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;italic&gt;Gsdmd&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;italic&gt;-/-&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; lungs identified restrained expression of inflammatory molecules and altered neutrophil gene signatures in &lt;italic&gt;Casp11&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice. We confirmed that protein levels of inflammatory mediators IL-1β, IL6, and CXCL1, and neutrophil functions, were reduced in &lt;italic&gt;Casp11&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; lungs. Additionally, &lt;italic&gt;Casp11&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; lungs accumulated less von Willebrand factor, a marker for endothelial damage, but expressed more Kruppel-Like Factor 2, a transcription factor that maintains vascular integrity. Overall, our results demonstrate that CASP4/11, promotes detrimental SARS-CoV-2-associated inflammation and coagulopathy, largely independently of GSDMD, identifying CASP4/11 as a promising drug target for treatment and prevention of severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.24.461743" rel="alternate" title="Caspase-4/11 exacerbates disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection by promoting inflammation and thrombosis (16 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21263948</id><title>Demographic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant infections in Indian population (16 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.753961+00:00</updated><author><name>Ashutosh Kumar</name></author><author><name>Adil Asghar</name></author><author><name>Khursheed Raza</name></author><author><name>Ravi K.

Now, accumulating evidence suggests greater involvement of lower age and narrowing the age and sex based differences for the severity of symptoms in infections with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Delta variant (B.1.617.2) is now a globally dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain, however, current evidence on demographic characteristics for this variant are limited. Recently, delta variant caused a devastating second wave of COVID-19 in India. We performed a demographic characterization of COVID-19 cases in Indian population diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing for delta variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Objective&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine demographic characteristics of delta variant in terms of age and sex, severity of the illness and mortality rate, and post-vaccination infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Design&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cross sectional study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Setting&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demographic characteristics, including vaccination status (for two complete doses) and severity of the illness and mortality rate, of COVID-19 cases caused by wild type strain (B.1) and delta variant (B.1.617.2) of SARS-CoV-2 in Indian population were studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Participants&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 cases for which SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing was performed and complete demographic details (age, sex, and location) were available, were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Exposures&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 infection with Delta (B.1.617.2) variant and wild type (B.1) strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient metadata containing details for demographic and vaccination status (two complete doses) of the COVID-19 patients with confirmed delta variant and WT (B.1) infections were analyzed [total number of cases (N) =9500, N&lt;sub&gt;delta&lt;/sub&gt;=6238, N&lt;sub&gt;WT&lt;/sub&gt;=3262]. Further, severity of the illness and mortality were assessed in subsets of patients. Final data were tabulated and statistically analyzed to determine age and sex based differences in chances of getting infection and the severity of illness, and post-vaccination infections were compared between wild type and delta variant strains. Graphs were plotted to visualize the trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;With delta variant, in comparison to wild type (B.1) strain, higher proportion of lower age groups, particularly &amp;lt;20 year (0-9 year: 4.47% vs. 2.3%, 10-19 year: 9% vs. 7%) were affected. The proportion of women contracting infection were increased (41% vs. 36%). The higher proportion of total young (0-19 year, 10% vs. 4%) (p=.017) population and young (14% vs. 3%) as well as adult (20-59 year, 75% vs. 55%) women developed symptoms/hospitalized with delta variant in comparison to B.1 infection (p&amp;lt; .00001). The mean age of contracting infection [Delta, men=37.9 (±17.2) year, women=36.6 (±17.6) year; B.1, men=39.6 (±16.9) year and women= 40.1 (±17.4) year (p&amp;lt; .001)] as well as developing symptoms/hospitalization [Delta, men=39.6(± 17.4) year, women=35.6 (±16.9) year; B.1, men=47(±18) year and women= 49.5(±20.9) year (p&amp;lt; .001)] was considerably lower. The total mortality was about 1.8 times higher (13% vs. 7%). Risk of death increased irrespective of the sex (Odds ratio: 3.034, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.7-5.2, p&amp;lt;0.001), however, increased proportion of women (32% vs. 25%) were died. Further, multiple incidences of delta infections were noted following complete vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increased involvement of young (0-19 year) and women, lower mean age for contracting infection and symptomatic illness/hospitalization, higher mortality, and frequent incidences of post-vaccination infections with delta variant compared to wild type strain raises significant epidemiological concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Key Points&lt;/title&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Question&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant infections show varied demographic characteristics in comparison to wild type strains?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Findings&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this cross sectional study viral genomic sequences of 9500 COVID-19 patients were analyzed. As the key findings, increased involvement of young (0-19 year) and women, lower mean age for contracting infection and symptomatic illness/hospitalization, higher mortality, and frequent incidences of post-vaccination infections with delta variant in comparison to wild type (WT) strain (B.1) were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Meaning&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study suggest that delta variant has varied demographic characteristics reflecting increased involvement of the young and women, and increased lethality in comparison to wild type strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21263948" rel="alternate" title="Demographic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant infections in Indian population (16 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-09-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21264014</id><title>Neutralizing efficacy of vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 Mu variant (15 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.754756+00:00</updated><author><name>Kei Miyakawa</name></author><author><name>Sundararaj Stanleyraj Jeremiah</name></author><author><name>Hideaki Kato</name></author><author><name>Akihide Ryo</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The rise of mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2 poses an additional problem to the existing pandemic of COVID-19.

We also show that Mu, similar to the Delta variant, causes cell-to-cell fusion which can be an additional factor for the variant to escape vaccine-mediated humoral immunity.

Blood coagulation factor Xa (FXa) and SARS-CoV-2 major protease (M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;) share over 80% homology at the three-dimensional protein level. Thus, it is worth interrogating whether there is crosstalk between inhibitors and substrates between these enzymes. Here, we found that the clinically-approved FXa inhibitor apixaban targets SARS-CoV-2 M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; with a 21-fold higher potency than boceprevir (GC376). Apixaban displayed a non-competitive mechanism of inhibition towards M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;, since it targets the enzyme/substrate complex and the allosteric site onto the viral protease. Enzymatic assays were further validated in infected Calu-3 cells, which reveal that apixaban decreases the production of infectious viral particles in a dose-dependent manner, with an inhibitory potency in the micromolar range. Our results are in line with the proposed early use of anticoagulants, including FXa inhibitors, to improve clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. In this context, apixaban may display a dual mechanism of action by targeting FXa to prevent coagulopathy and, at some level, SARS-CoV-2 M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.461605" rel="alternate" title="Apixaban, an orally available anticoagulant, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication by targeting its major protease in a non-competitive way (15 tweets)"/><category term="Microbiology"/><published>2021-09-24T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21263924</id><title>PANDEMIC POLICY DESIGN VIA FEEDBACK: A MODELLING STUDY (14 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.755218+00:00</updated><author><name>Klaske Van Heusden</name></author><author><name>Greg Stewart</name></author><author><name>Sarah Otto</name></author><author><name>Guy Dumont</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous toll on human health and well-being and led to major social and economic disruptions. Public health interventions in response to burgeoning case numbers and hospitalizations have repeatedly bent down the epidemic curve in many jurisdictions, effectively creating a closed-loop dynamic system. We aim to formalize and illustrate how to incorporate principles of feedback control into pandemic projections and decision making.
Starting with a SEEIQR epidemiological model, we illustrate how feedback control can be incorporated into pandemic management using a simple design (proportional-integral or PI control), which couples recent changes in case numbers or hospital occupancy with explicit policy restrictions. We then analyse a closed-loop system between the SEEIQR model and the designed feedback controller to illustrate the potential benefits of pandemic policy design that incorporates feedback.
We first explored a feedback design that responded to hospital measured infections, demonstrating robust ability to control a pandemic despite simulating large uncertainty in reproduction number R0 (range: 1.04-5.18) and average time to hospital admission (range: 4-28 days). The second design compared responding to hospital occupancy to responding to case counts, showing that shorter delays reduced both the cumulative case count and the average level of interventions. Finally, we show that feedback is robust to changing public compliance to public health directives, and to systemic changes associated with new variants of concern and with the introduction of a vaccination program.
The negative impact of a pandemic on human health and societal disruption can be reduced by coupling models of disease propagation with models of the decision-making process. This creates a closed-loop system that better represents the coupled dynamics of a disease and public health responses. Importantly, we show that feedback control is robust to delays in both measurements and responses, and to uncertainty in model parameters and the efficacy of control measures.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21263924" rel="alternate" title="PANDEMIC POLICY DESIGN VIA FEEDBACK: A MODELLING STUDY (14 tweets)"/><category term="Public and Global Health"/><published>2021-09-24T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.16.460716</id><title>The supramolecular organization of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 virions revealed by coarse-grained models of intact virus envelopes (14 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.755382+00:00</updated><author><name>Beibei Wang</name></author><author><name>Changqing Zhong</name></author><author><name>D.

The pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has a high sequence and architecture identity with SARS-CoV, but far more people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2. Here, combining structural data from cryo-EM and structure prediction, we constructed bottom-up Martini coarse-grained models of intact SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 envelopes. Microsecond molecular dynamics simulations were performed, allowing us to explore their dynamics and supramolecular organization. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 envelopes present a spherical morphology with structural proteins forming multiple string-like islands in the membrane and clusters between heads of spike proteins. Critical differences between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 envelopes are the interaction pattern between spike proteins and the flexibility of spike proteins. Our models provide structural and dynamic insights in the SARS virus envelopes, and could be used for further investigation, such as drug design, and fusion and fission processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.16.460716" rel="alternate" title="The supramolecular organization of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 virions revealed by coarse-grained models of intact virus envelopes (14 tweets)"/><category term="Biophysics"/><published>2021-09-20T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.18.460924</id><title>Spike independent replication of human coronavirus in bat cells (14 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.755533+00:00</updated><author><name>Martin Linster</name></author><author><name>Marcus G Mah</name></author><author><name>Dolyce HW Low</name></author><author><name>Zhuang Yan</name></author><author><name>Jayanthi Jayakumar</name></author><author><name>Firdaus Samsudin</name></author><author><name>Foong Ying Wong</name></author><author><name>Peter J Bond</name></author><author><name>Ian H Mendenhall</name></author><author><name>Yvonne CF Su</name></author><author><name>Gavin JD Smith</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Bats are a likely zoonotic reservoir for a range of human pathogens including endemic human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2. Despite the high burden caused by these viruses, the factors required for the establishment and ongoing transmission in humans are not well understood, hampering efforts for pandemic preparedness. To help understand those adaptations required to cross the species barrier, we serially passaged endemic human coronavirus 229E isolates in a newly established &lt;italic&gt;Rhinolophus&lt;/italic&gt; (horseshoe bat) kidney cell line. Here we report extensive mutations, including deletions, in the virus genome that result in the loss of spike protein expression, while maintaining the capability to infect bat cells. While we observed a loss of infectivity of human cells for all viruses with spike deletions, one isolate (2613) with an insertion that results in an early stop codon, was recovered from human cells. Deep sequencing of isolate 2613 showed that the majority population had acquired additional nucleotide insertions in the spike resulting in an additional codon that restores spike function. Spike-independent replication of coronaviruses provides an alternative route for infection of host species that don’t share common cell-entry receptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.18.460924" rel="alternate" title="Spike independent replication of human coronavirus in bat cells (14 tweets)"/><category term="Microbiology"/><published>2021-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.24.461759</id><title>Protein Vaccine Induces a Durable, More Broadly Neutralizing Antibody Response in Macaques than Natural Infection with SARS-CoV-2 P.1 (13 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.756945+00:00</updated><author><name>Albert To</name></author><author><name>Teri Ann S.

Here we describe the durability and broad-spectrum VOC immunity of a prefusion-stabilized spike (S) protein adjuvanted with liquid or lyophilized CoVaccine HT™ in cynomolgus macaques. This recombinant subunit vaccine is highly immunogenic and induces robust spike-specific and broadly neutralizing antibody responses effective against circulating VOCs (B.1.351 [Beta], P.1 [Gamma], B.1.617 [Delta]) for at least 3 months after the final boost. Protective efficacy and post-exposure immunity were evaluated using a heterologous P.1 challenge nearly 3 months after the last immunization. Our results indicate that while immunization with both high and low S doses shorten and reduce viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tract, a higher antigen dose is required to provide durable protection against disease as vaccine immunity wanes. Histologically, P.1 infection causes similar COVID-19-like lung pathology as seen with early pandemic isolates. Post-challenge IgG concentrations were restored to peak immunity levels and vaccine-matched and cross-variant neutralizing antibodies were significantly elevated in immunized macaques indicating an efficient anamnestic response. Only low levels of P.1-specific neutralizing antibodies with limited breadth were observed in control (non-vaccinated but challenged) macaques suggesting that natural infection may not prevent reinfection by other VOCs. Overall, these results demonstrate that a properly dosed and adjuvanted recombinant subunit vaccine can provide long-lasting and protective immunity against circulating VOCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;One Sentence Summary&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recombinant subunit protein formulated with CoVaccine HT™ adjuvant induces superior immunity than natural infection and reduces viral load while protecting cynomolgus macaques from COVID-19-like disease caused by late SARS-CoV-2 P.1 (Gamma) challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.24.461759" rel="alternate" title="Protein Vaccine Induces a Durable, More Broadly Neutralizing Antibody Response in Macaques than Natural Infection with SARS-CoV-2 P.1 (13 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.22.21263711</id><title>Comparison of adverse events between COVID-19 and Flu vaccines (13 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.757391+00:00</updated><author><name>Prajwal Mani Pradhan</name></author><author><name>Zhoutian Shen</name></author><author><name>Changye Li</name></author><author><name>Michael J.

Our study also quantified the proportion of rare adverse events such as Guillain Barre Syndrome and Gynecological changes in the VAERS database for COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;CONCLUSIONS&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the available data and results, it appears that there were some common adverse events between Flu vaccines and COVID-19 vaccines. These identified common adverse events warrant further investigations based on the relative risk and 95% CI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.22.21263711" rel="alternate" title="Comparison of adverse events between COVID-19 and Flu vaccines (13 tweets)"/><category term="Public and Global Health"/><published>2021-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.24.21263996</id><title>Acquired peripheral nerve injuries associated with severe COVID-19 (13 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.757641+00:00</updated><author><name>Colin K.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive overview of the effectiveness profile of COVID-19 vaccines against VOC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published and preprinted randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and case-control studies that evaluated the VE against VOC (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, or Delta) were searched until 31 August 2021. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis. VE was defined as (1− estimate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven RCTs (51,169 participants), 10 cohort studies (14,385,909 participants) and 16 case-control studies (734,607 cases) were included. Eight COVID-19 vaccines (mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, Ad26.COV2.S, NVX-CoV2373, BBV152, CoronaVac, and BBIBP-CorV) were included in this analysis. Full vaccination was effective against Alpha, Beta/Gamma, and Delta variants, with VE of 88.3% (95% CI, 82.4–92.2), 70.7% (95% CI, 59.9–78.5), and 71.6% (95% CI, 64.1–77.4), respectively. But partial vaccination was less effective, with VE of 59.0% (95% CI, 51.3–65.5), 49.3% (95% CI, 33.0–61.6), and 52.6% (95% CI, 43.3–60.4), respectively. mRNA vaccines seemed to have higher VE against VOC over others, significant interactions (p&lt;sub&gt;interaction&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.10) were observed between VE and vaccine type (mRNA vaccines vs. non-mRNA vaccines).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full vaccination of COVID-19 vaccines is highly effective against Alpha variant, and moderate effective against Beta/Gamma and Delta variants. Partial vaccination has less VE against VOC. mRNA vaccines seem to have higher VE against Alpha, Beta/Gamma, and Delta variants over others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21264048" rel="alternate" title="Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern: a systematic review and meta-analysis (13 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.12.21263442</id><title>Financial and Non-financial Conflicts of Interest Among the Japanese Government Advisory Board Members Concerning Coronavirus Disease 2019 (12 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.758500+00:00</updated><author><name>Hanano Mamada</name></author><author><name>Anju Murayama</name></author><author><name>Akihiko Ozaki</name></author><author><name>Takanao Hashimoto</name></author><author><name>Hiroaki Saito</name></author><author><name>Toyoaki Sawano</name></author><author><name>Divya Bhandari</name></author><author><name>Sunil Shrestha</name></author><author><name>Tetsuya Tanimoto</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Objectives&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to assess the extent of conflicts of interest among the Japanese government COVID-19 advisory board members and elucidate the accuracy of conflicts of interest (COI) disclosure and management strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the payment data from all 79 pharmaceutical companies in Japan between 2017 and 2018 and direct research grants from the Japanese government between 2019 and 2020, we evaluated the extent of financial and non-financial COI among all 20 Japanese government COVID-19 advisory board members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese government COVID-19 advisory board members were predominantly male (75.0%) and physicians (50.0%). Between 2019 and 2020, two members (10.0%) received a total of $819,244 in government research funding. Another five members (25.0%) received $419,725 in payments, including $223,183 in personal fees, from 28 pharmaceutical companies between 2017 and 2018. The average value of the pharmaceutical payments was $20,986 (standard deviation: $81,762). Further, neither the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare nor the Japanese Cabinet Secretariat disclosed financial or non-financial COI with industry. Further, the government and had no policies for managing COI among advisory board members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study found that the Japanese government COVID-19 advisory board had financial and non-financial COI with pharmaceutical companies and the government. Further, there were no rigorous COI management strategies for the COVID-19 advisory board members.

Here, we assessed a cohort of 74 CID patients treated as monotherapy with chronic immunosuppressive drugs for functional antibody responses in serum against historical and variant SARS-CoV-2 viruses after immunization with Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. Longitudinal analysis showed the greatest reductions in neutralizing antibodies and Fc effector function capacity in individuals treated with TNF-α inhibitors, and this pattern appeared worse against the B.1.617.2 Delta virus. Within five months of vaccination, serum neutralizing titers of the majority of CID patients fell below the presumed threshold correlate for antibody-mediated protection. Thus, further vaccine boosting or administration of long-acting prophylaxis (&lt;italic&gt;e&lt;/italic&gt;.&lt;italic&gt;g&lt;/italic&gt;., monoclonal antibodies) likely will be required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in this susceptible population.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264250" rel="alternate" title="Reduced antibody activity against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 Delta virus in serum of mRNA-vaccinated patients receiving TNF-α inhibitors (12 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21263047</id><title>Anti-PF4 VITT antibodies are oligoclonal and variably inhibited by heparin (11 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.763411+00:00</updated><author><name>B Singh</name></author><author><name>A Kanack</name></author><author><name>A Bayas</name></author><author><name>G George</name></author><author><name>MY Abou-Ismail</name></author><author><name>M Kohlhagen</name></author><author><name>M Christ</name></author><author><name>M Naumann</name></author><author><name>K Moser</name></author><author><name>K Smock</name></author><author><name>A Grazioli</name></author><author><name>D Murray</name></author><author><name>A Padmanabhan</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccines have been associated with a rare thrombotic and thrombocytopenic reaction, Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) characterized by platelet-activating anti-PF4 antibodies. This study sought to assess clonality of VITT antibodies and evaluate their characteristics in antigen-based and functional platelet studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-PF4 antibodies were isolated from five patients with VITT secondary to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n=1) or Ad26.COV2.S (n=4) vaccination. For comparative studies with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), anti-PF4 antibodies were isolated from one patient with spontaneous HIT, another with “classical” HIT, and two patients with non-pathogenic (non-platelet activating) anti-PF4 antibodies. Isolated antibodies were subject to ELISA and functional testing, and mass spectrometric evaluation for clonality determination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;All five VITT patients had oligoclonal anti-PF4 antibodies (3 monoclonal, one bi- and one tri-clonal antibodies), while HIT anti-PF4 antibodies were polyclonal. Notably, like VITT antibodies, anti-PF4 antibodies from a spontaneous HIT patient were monoclonal. The techniques employed did not detect non-pathogenic anti-PF4 antibodies. The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19-associated VITT patient made an excellent recovery with heparin treatment. In vitro studies demonstrated strong inhibition of VITT antibody-induced platelet activation with therapeutic concentrations of heparin in this and one Ad26.COV2.S-associated VITT patient. Oligoclonal VITT antibodies with persistent platelet-activating potential were detected at 6 and 10 weeks after acute presentation in two patients tested. Two of the 5 VITT patients had recurrence of thrombocytopenia and one patient had focal seizures several weeks after acute presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oligoclonal anti-PF4 antibodies mediate VITT.

The repository contains over 430,000 articles as of 20 September 2021 and intends to provide a one-stop shop for COVID-19 evidence. Considering that systematic reviews conduct high-quality searches, this study assesses the comprehensiveness and currency of the repository against the total number of studies in a representative sample of COVID-19 systematic reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our sample was generated from all the studies included in the systematic reviews of COVID-19 published during April 2021. We estimated the comprehensiveness of COVID-19 L·OVE repository by determining how many of the individual studies in the sample were included in the COVID-19 L·OVE repository. We estimated the currency as the percentage of studies that were available in the COVID-19 L·OVE repository at the time the systematic reviews conducted their own search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified 83 eligible systematic reviews that included 2132 studies. COVID-19 L·OVE had an overall comprehensiveness of 99.67% (2125/2132). The overall currency of the repository, that is, the proportion of articles that would have been obtained if the search of the reviews was conducted in COVID-19 L·OVE instead of searching the original sources, was 96.48% (2057/2132). Both the comprehensiveness and the currency were 100% for randomised trials (82/82).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 L·OVE repository is highly comprehensive and current. Using this repository instead of traditional manual searches in multiple databases can save a great amount of work to people conducting systematic reviews and would improve the comprehensiveness and timeliness of evidence syntheses.

This dosing schedule is associated with inhibition of seroconversion following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, in contrast to the high levels of seroconversion following treatment with alemtuzumab and cladribine tablets. A number of emerging reports suggest that repopulation of 1-3% B cells facilitates seroconversion after CD20-depletion. The frequency of this occurring following repeated ocrelizumab treatment, after other DMT, and after treatment cessation is largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relapse data, lymphocyte and CD19 B cell numbers were extracted from phase II ocrelizumab extension study (&lt;ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="clintrialgov" xlink:href="NCT00676715"&gt;NCT00676715&lt;/ext-link&gt;) data supplied by the manufacturer via the Vivli Inc, trial data-request portal.

During this time relapses occurred at consistent disease breakthrough rates compared to people during standard therapy. In contrast most people (90-100%) exhibited more than 1% B cells during treatment with either cladribine or alemtuzumab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few people repopulate peripheral B cells with standard ocrelizumab dosing, however an extending the dosing interval by 3-6 months may allow many more people to potentially seroconvert in the relative absence of excess relapse-activity. Most people demonstrate B cell repletion within 3 months of the last treatment of alemtuzumab and cladribine. This may help protect against severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.26.21264023" rel="alternate" title="CD19 B cell repopulation after ocrelizumab, alemtuzumab and cladribine: Implications for SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations in multiple sclerosis (11 tweets)"/><category term="Neurology"/><published>2021-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.21264225</id><title>Impact of long-COVID on health-related quality of life in Japanese COVID-19 patients (11 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.764951+00:00</updated><author><name>Shinya Tsuzuki</name></author><author><name>Yusuke Miyazato</name></author><author><name>Mari Terada</name></author><author><name>Shinichiro Morioka</name></author><author><name>Norio Ohmagari</name></author><author><name>Philippe Beutels</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The empirical basis for a quantitative assessment of the disease burden imposed by long-COVID is currently scant.

A strong response was induced in monocytes and B cells, with a SARS-CoV2-specific inflammatory gene cluster distinct from that seen in influenza-A or Ebola virus-infected co-cultures, and which reproduced deviations reported in blood or lung myeloid cells from COVID-19 patients. A substantial fraction of the effect could be reproduced after individual transfection of several SARS-CoV2 proteins (Spike and some non-structural proteins), mediated by soluble factors, but not via transcriptional induction. This response was greatly muted in monocytes from healthy children, perhaps a clue to the age-dependency of COVID-19. These results suggest that the inflammatory malfunction in COVID-19 is rooted in the earliest perturbations that SARS-CoV2 induces in epithelia.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.462202" rel="alternate" title="A virus-specific monocyte inflammatory phenotype is induced by SARS-CoV2 at the immune-epithelial interface (10 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.24.461616</id><title>Broad ultra-potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants by monoclonal antibodies specific to the tip of RBD (10 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.765463+00:00</updated><author><name>Hang Ma</name></author><author><name>Yingying Guo</name></author><author><name>Haoneng Tang</name></author><author><name>Chien-Te K.

Higher transmissibility and immunologic resistance of VOCs bring unprecedented challenges to epidemic extinguishment. Here we describe a monoclonal antibody, 2G1, that neutralizes all current VOCs and has surprising tolerance to mutations adjacent to or within its interaction epitope. Cryo-electron microscopy structure showed that 2G1 bound to the tip of receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein with small contact interface but strong hydrophobic effect, which resulted in nanomolar to sub-nanomolar affinities to spike proteins. The epitope of 2G1 on RBD partially overlaps with ACE2 interface, which gives 2G1 ability to block interaction between RBD and ACE2. The narrow binding epitope but high affinity bestow outstanding therapeutic efficacy upon 2G1 that neutralized VOCs with sub-nanomolar IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt;. In SARS-CoV-2 and Beta- and Delta-variant-challenged transgenic mice and rhesus macaque models, 2G1 protected animals from clinical illness and eliminated viral burden, without serious impact to animal safety. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that 2G1 could be potentially capable of dealing with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in future. This report characterized the therapeutic antibodies specific to the tip of spike against SARS-CoV-2 variants and highlights the potential clinical applications as well as for developing vaccine and cocktail therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.24.461616" rel="alternate" title="Broad ultra-potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants by monoclonal antibodies specific to the tip of RBD (10 tweets)"/><category term="Cell Biology"/><published>2021-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.22.21263984</id><title>Consequences of COVID-19 vaccine allocation inequity in Chicago (10 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.767196+00:00</updated><author><name>Sharon Zeng</name></author><author><name>Kenley M.

However, the impact of this inequitable distribution on COVID-19 outcomes is unknown. This observational study determined the association between zip-code level vaccination rate and COVID-19 mortality in residents of 52 Chicago zip codes. After controlling for age distribution and recovery from infection, a 10% higher vaccination rate by March 28, 2021, was associated with a 39% lower relative risk of death during the peak of the spring wave of COVID-19. Using a difference-in-difference analysis, Chicago could have prevented an estimated 72% of deaths in the least vaccinated quartile of the city (vaccination rates of 17.8 – 26.9%) if it had had the same vaccination rate as the most vaccinated quartile (39.9 – 49.3%).

ISGs antagonize viral pathogens directly through diverse mechanisms acting at different stages of viral life cycles, and indirectly by modulating cell cycle and promoting programmed cell death. The mechanisms of action and viral specificities for most ISGs remain incompletely understood. To enable the high throughput interrogation of ISG antiviral functions in pooled genetic screens while mitigating the potentially confounding effects of endogenous IFN and potential antiproliferative/proapoptotic ISG activities, we adapted a CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) system for inducible ISG induction in isogenic cell lines with and without the capacity to respond to IFN. Engineered CRISPRa cell lines demonstrated inducible, robust, and specific gRNA-directed expression of ISGs, which are functional in restricting viral infection. Using this platform, we screened for ISGs that restrict SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results included ISGs previously described to restrict SARS-CoV-2 as well as multiple novel candidate antiviral factors. We validated a subset of candidate hits by complementary targeted CRISPRa and ectopic cDNA expression infection experiments, which, among other hits, confirmed OAS1 as a SARS-CoV-2 restriction factor. OAS1 exhibited strong antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, and these effects required OAS1 catalytic activity. These studies demonstrate a robust, high-throughput approach to assess antiviral functions within the ISG repertoire, exemplified by the identification of multiple novel SARS-CoV-2 restriction factors.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.22.461286" rel="alternate" title="Inducible CRISPR activation screen for interferon-stimulated genes identifies OAS1 as a SARS-CoV-2 restriction factor (10 tweets)"/><category term="Microbiology"/><published>2021-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.21.21263845</id><title>Evidence of Persisting Autoreactivity in Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (10 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.768283+00:00</updated><author><name>Matthew C.

Importantly, we have identified a relaxation of peripheral tolerance within early antibody secreting cells that emerge in patients with COVID-19 as important drivers of those responses. While often viral-specific, these extrafollicular-derived cells also display cross reactivity to autoantigens present in the inflammatory lung environment, and despite resolution of most autoreactivity within 6 months, they persisted in some patients. These results raise questions regarding autoreactive antibodies that arise during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and their persistence in patients with symptoms in Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). Through clinical autoreactive antibody screening of 95 patients with PASC and no history of autoimmune disease, we identify significant autoreactive profiles in patients with ongoing symptoms post-recovery, with 80% of patients returning positive tests for at least one autoantigen, and 40% showing breaks in tolerance to 2 or more. Anti-nuclear antigen positivity was most common, displaying positivity in 63% of patients, however, positive tests were broad and included reactivities against carbamylated protein responses, RNA polymerase III, and phospholipids. We also identify patients with reactivity against dsDNA in the PASC cohort – a reactivity not observed in acute infection even in the critically ill. These results demonstrate evidence of elevated serum autoantibodies in patients who present to PASC clinics with persistent symptoms up 14 months following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and further confirm the growing linkage between COVID-19 and observed clinical autoreactivity – even into the recovery phase of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.21.21263845" rel="alternate" title="Evidence of Persisting Autoreactivity in Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (10 tweets)"/><category term="Rheumatology"/><published>2021-09-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.24.21264081</id><title>SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness and breakthrough infections in maintenance dialysis patients (9 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.768659+00:00</updated><author><name>Harold J.

The underlying technology is an adaptation of synthetic long peptides (SLPs) previously used in cancer immunotherapy. SLPs comprising HLA class I and class II epitopes are used to stimulate antigen cross-presentation and canonical class II presentation by dendritic cells. The result is a cytotoxic T cell-mediated prompt and specific immune response against the virus-infected epithelia and a rapid and robust virus clearance.

Empirically derived breakpoints in case and mortality velocities were used to identify periods of stable, decreasing, or increasing COVID-19 burden. The associations between NPI adoption and subsequent decreases in case or death velocities were estimated using generalized linear models accounting for weekly variability shared across states. State-level NPI policies included: stay at home order, indoor public gathering ban (mild &amp;gt;10 or severe ≤10), indoor restaurant dining ban, and public mask mandate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;28,602,830 cases and 511,899 deaths were recorded. The odds of a decrease in COVID-19 case velocity were significantly elevated for stay at home (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.63-2.52), indoor dining ban (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.25-2.10), public mask mandate (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.47-3.23), and severe gathering ban (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.31-2.16).

Stay at home (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.53-2.62; AOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.25-2.87) was also associated with greater likelihood of decrease in death velocity in unadjusted and adjusted models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;NPIs employed in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic, most significantly stay at home orders, were associated with decreased COVID-19 burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.26.21264142" rel="alternate" title="Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions and COVID-19 Burden in the United States (9 tweets)"/><category term="Public and Global Health"/><published>2021-09-28T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.461855</id><title>Mutational Signatures as Sensors of Environmental Exposures: Role of Smoking in COVID-19 Vulnerabilities (9 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.770583+00:00</updated><author><name>Yoo-Ah Kim</name></author><author><name>Ermin Hodzic</name></author><author><name>Ariella Saslafsky</name></author><author><name>Damian Wojtowicz</name></author><author><name>Bayarbaatar Amgalan</name></author><author><name>Teresa M. Przytycka</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental exposures such as smoking are widely recognized risk factors in the emergence of lung diseases including lung cancer and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the strength of environmental exposures is difficult to measure, making it challenging to understand their impacts. On the other hand, some COVID-19 patients develop ARDS in an unfavorable disease progression and smoking has been suggested as a potential risk factor among others. Yet initial studies on COVID-19 cases reported contradictory results on the effects of smoking on the disease – some suggest that smoking might have a protective effect against it while other studies report an increased risk. A better understanding of how the exposure to smoking and other environmental factors affect biological processes relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection and unfavorable disease progression is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Approach&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we utilize mutational signatures associated with environmental factors as sensors of their exposure level. Many environmental factors including smoking are mutagenic and leave characteristic patterns of mutations, called mutational signatures, in affected genomes. We postulated that analyzing mutational signatures, combined with gene expression, can shed light on the impact of the mutagenic environmental factors to the biological processes. In particular, we utilized mutational signatures from lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) data set collected in TCGA to investigate the role of environmental factors in COVID-19 vulnerabilities. Integrating mutational signatures with gene expression in normal tissues and using a pathway level analysis, we examined how the exposure to smoking and other mutagenic environmental factors affects the infectivity of the virus and disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;By delineating changes associated with smoking in pathway-level gene expression and cell type proportions, our study demonstrates that mutational signatures can be utilized to study the impact of exogenous mutagenic factors on them. Consistent with previous findings, our analysis showed that smoking mutational signature (SBS4) is associated with activation of cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, leading to inflammatory responses. Smoking related changes in cell composition were also observed, including the correlation of SBS4 with the expansion of goblet cells. On the other hand, increased basal cells and decreased ciliated cells in proportion were associated with the strength of a different mutational signature (SBS5), which is present abundantly but not exclusively in smokers. In addition, we found that smoking increases the expression levels of genes that are up-regulated in severe COVID-19 cases. Jointly, these results suggest an unfavorable impact of smoking on the disease progression and also provide novel findings on how smoking impacts biological processes in lung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.461855" rel="alternate" title="Mutational Signatures as Sensors of Environmental Exposures: Role of Smoking in COVID-19 Vulnerabilities (9 tweets)"/><category term="Systems Biology"/><published>2021-09-28T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264234</id><title>A brief analysis of the COVID-19 death data in Malaysia (9 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.771071+00:00</updated><author><name>Wan Nor Arifin</name></author><author><name>Kamarul Imran Musa</name></author><author><name>Tengku Muhammad Hanis</name></author><author><name>Wan Shakira Rodzlan Hasani</name></author><author><name>Che Muhammad Nur Hidayat Che Nawi</name></author><author><name>Erwan Ershad Ahmad Khan</name></author><author><name>Mohd Azmi Suliman</name></author><author><name>Sahrol Azmi Termizi</name></author><author><name>Wira Alfatah Ab Aziz</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;In December 2019, the first cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) were detected in Wuhan, China.

Emerging evidence suggests the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 may also spread by airborne transmission. This is more likely in indoor environments, particularly with poor ventilation. In the context of potential airborne transmission, a vital mitigation strategy for the built environment is heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. HVAC features could modify virus transmission potential. A systematic review following international standards was conducted to comprehensively identify and synthesize research examining the effectiveness of filters within HVAC systems in reducing virus transmission. Twenty-three relevant studies showed that: filtration was associated with decreased transmission; filters removed viruses from the air; increasing filter efficiency (efficiency of particle removal) was associated with decreased transmission, decreased infection risk, and increased viral filtration efficiency (efficiency of virus removal); increasing filter efficiency above MERV 13 was associated with limited benefit in further reduction of virus concentration and infection risk; and filters with the same efficiency rating from different companies showed variable performance. Increasing filter efficiency may mitigate virus transmission; however, improvement may be limited above MERV 13. Adapting HVAC systems to mitigate virus transmission requires a multi-factorial approach and filtration is one factor offering demonstrated potential for decreased transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Practical Implications&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order for filtration to be an effective means of virus removal and transmission control, proper installation is required. As well, professionals should be aware of the fact that similarly rated filters from different companies may offer different virus reduction results. While increasing filtration efficiency (i.e., increasing MERV rating or moving from MERV to HEPA) is associated with virus mitigation, there appears to be diminishing returns for filters rated MERV 13 or higher. Although costs increase with filtration efficiency, filtration costs are lower than the cost of ventilation options with the equivalent reduction in transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21264025" rel="alternate" title="The impact of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning design features on the transmission of viruses, including the 2019 novel coronavirus: a systematic review of filtration (8 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.25.21264117</id><title>Lasting changes to circulating leukocytes in people with mild SARS-CoV-2 infections (8 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.771614+00:00</updated><author><name>Allison E.

Herein we investigated lasting changes to soluble inflammatory factors and cellular immune phenotype and function in individuals who had recovered from mild SARS-CoV-2 infections (n=22) compared to those that had recovered from other mild respiratory infections (n=11). Individuals who had mild SARS-CoV-2 infections had elevated levels of C-reactive protein 1-3 months after symptom onset, and changes in phenotype and function of circulating T cells that were not apparent in individuals 6-9 months post-symptom onset. Markers of monocyte activation and expression of adherence and chemokine receptors indicative of altered migratory capacity were also higher at 1-3 months post-infection in individuals who had mild SARS-CoV-2, but these were no longer elevated by 6-9 months post-infection. Perhaps most surprisingly, polyclonal activation of T cells was higher in individuals who had recently experienced a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to individuals with other recent respiratory infections. These data are indicative of prolonged immune activation and systemic inflammation that persists for up to three months after mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.25.21264117" rel="alternate" title="Lasting changes to circulating leukocytes in people with mild SARS-CoV-2 infections (8 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.25.461776</id><title>LRRC15 mediates an accessory interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (8 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.772061+00:00</updated><author><name>Jarrod Shilts</name></author><author><name>Thomas W.

Wright</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human host factors enable the virus to propagate infections that lead to COVID-19. The spike protein is the largest structural component of the virus and mediates interactions essential for infection, including with the primary ACE2 receptor. We performed two independent cell-based systematic screens to determine whether there are additional proteins by which the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can interact with human cells. We discovered that in addition to ACE2, expression of LRRC15 also causes spike protein binding. This interaction is distinct from other known spike attachment mechanisms such as heparan sulfates or lectin receptors. Measurements of orthologous coronavirus spike proteins implied the interaction was restricted to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting LRRC15 represents a novel class of spike binding interaction. We localized the interaction to the C-terminus of the S1 domain, and showed that LRRC15 shares recognition of the ACE2 receptor binding domain. From analyzing proteomics and single-cell transcriptomics, we identify LRRC15 expression as being common in human lung vasculature cells and fibroblasts. Although infection assays demonstrated that LRRC15 alone is not sufficient to permit viral entry, we present evidence it can modulate infection of human cells. This unexpected interaction merits further investigation to determine how SARS-CoV-2 exploits host LRRC15 and whether it could account for any of the distinctive features of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;In brief&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We present evidence from genome-wide screening that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with human cells expressing LRRC15. The interaction is distinct from previously known classes of spike attachment factors, and appears to have emerged recently within the coronavirus family. Although not sufficient for cell invasion, this interaction can modulate viral infection. Our data point to an unappreciated host factor for SARS-CoV-2, with potential relevance to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Highlights&lt;/title&gt;&lt;list list-type="simple"&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Two systematic cell-based screens for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding identify LRRC15 as a human host factor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Interaction with LRRC15 is reproducible in different human cell lines and independent of known glycan or ACE2 binding pathways&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The C-terminal S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike binds LRRC15 with sub-micromolar affinity, while related coronavirus spikes do not&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;p&gt;- LRRC15 is expressed in tissues with high ACE2 levels and may modulate infection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.25.461776" rel="alternate" title="LRRC15 mediates an accessory interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (8 tweets)"/><category term="Biochemistry"/><published>2021-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.462270</id><title>Data-driven approaches for genetic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 lineages (8 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.772419+00:00</updated><author><name>Fatima Mostefai</name></author><author><name>Isabel Gamache</name></author><author><name>Jessie Huang</name></author><author><name>Arnaud N’Guessan</name></author><author><name>Justin Pelletier</name></author><author><name>Ahmad Pesaranghader</name></author><author><name>David Hamelin</name></author><author><name>Carmen Lia Murall</name></author><author><name>Raphaël Poujol</name></author><author><name>Jean-Christophe Grenier</name></author><author><name>Martin Smith</name></author><author><name>Etienne Caron</name></author><author><name>Morgan Craig</name></author><author><name>Jesse Shapiro</name></author><author><name>Guy Wolf</name></author><author><name>Smita Krishnaswamy</name></author><author><name>Julie G. Hussin</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The genome of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been sequenced at an unprecedented scale, leading to a tremendous amount of viral genome sequencing data. To understand the evolution of this virus in humans, and to assist in tracing infection pathways and designing preventive strategies, we present a set of computational tools that span phylogenomics, population genetics and machine learning approaches. To illustrate the utility of this toolbox, we detail an in depth analysis of the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, using 329,854 high-quality consensus sequences published in the GISAID database during the pre-vaccination phase. We demonstrate that, compared to standard phylogenetic approaches, haplotype networks can be computed efficiently on much larger datasets, enabling real-time analyses. Furthermore, time series change of Tajima’s D provides a powerful metric of population expansion. Unsupervised learning techniques further highlight key steps in variant detection and facilitate the study of the role of this genomic variation in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with Multiscale PHATE methodology identifying fine-scale structure in the SARS-CoV-2 genetic data that underlies the emergence of key lineages. The computational framework presented here is useful for real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and could be applied to any pathogen that threatens the health of worldwide populations of humans and other organisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.462270" rel="alternate" title="Data-driven approaches for genetic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 lineages (8 tweets)"/><category term="Bioinformatics"/><published>2021-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.21.21263898</id><title>The Impact of New SARS-CoV-2 Variants on Vaccine Breakthrough: A Pilot Study on Spreading Infection in the Communities (8 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.772840+00:00</updated><author><name>Mohamad Ammar Ayass</name></author><author><name>Jin Zhang</name></author><author><name>Kevin Zhu</name></author><author><name>Wanying Cao</name></author><author><name>Natalya Griko</name></author><author><name>Victor Pashkov</name></author><author><name>Jun Dai</name></author><author><name>Trivendra Tripathi</name></author><author><name>Lina Abi Mosleh</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are effective at helping protect against severe disease and death from variants; however, incident of breakthrough infection in vaccinated patients has been increased. Therefore, we aimed to assess the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) new variants of concern in the communities and investigate vaccine breakthrough cases on our laboratory (Ayass Bioscience LLC) confirmed detection of COVID-19 variants in Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW), Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epidemiologic study has been performed at our laboratory. We studied the viral whole-genome sequence and genotyping analysis on 166 symptomatic cases of COVID-19 which were randomly selected from nasal swab positive cases assessed from June 1st to August 30th, 2021, by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) cycle threshold (CT) values. COVID-19 variants were identified to be dominated by B.1.617.2 (89.2%) and followed by AY.3 (1.8%), B.1.1.7 (4.8%), a combination of B.1.526.1 and B.1.617.2 (3%), B.1.621 (0.6%), and P.2 (0.6%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Result&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CT values showed significant difference among the three age groups: &amp;lt;30 years, 31-60 years, and &amp;gt;60 years by one-way ANOVA (N1: F (2, 118) =4.96, p=0.009; N2: F (2, 118) =4.95, p=0.009). No significant difference was observed by symptom, status of immunization, or vaccine manufacturer. A two-way ANOVA was performed to examine the effect of gender and variant group (Delta and other variants) on the CT values. The analyses revealed a statistically significant interaction between the effect of gender and variant group (N1, F (1.117) = 3.906, p = 0.05; N2, F (1, 117) = 7.402, p = 0.008).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study shows that Delta, the dominant variant of COVID-19, is spreading in the communities, and vaccine breakthrough cases occurred in the majority of Delta variant (91%) followed by AY.3 (5%), B.1.1.7 (2%) and 2% of the double variant of B.1.526.1 and B.1.617.2. The incidence of the breakthrough cases was not linked to a specific manufacturer. The CT value is likely to associate with age. This study also supports our laboratory’s ongoing efforts to sequence the SARS-CoV-2 virus from positive patient samples to identify the new viral variants and possible vaccine breakthrough mutations in the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.21.21263898" rel="alternate" title="The Impact of New SARS-CoV-2 Variants on Vaccine Breakthrough: A Pilot Study on Spreading Infection in the Communities (8 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.21264130</id><title>Effectiveness of the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 severe infections in the Israeli over 60 population: a temporal analysis done by using the national surveillance data (8 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.773157+00:00</updated><author><name>Stefano De Leo</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Last August, when the &lt;italic&gt;delta&lt;/italic&gt; variant became the dominant infection strain, Israel, one of the countries with the highest levels of vaccination in the world, faced a scary pandemic wave.

The study shows that the two-dose vaccine still works in preventing people from getting seriously sick but not with the same effectiveness observed in the first months of 2021.

The aim of the current investigation was to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched pathways in COVID-19 infection and its associated complications by bioinformatics analysis, and to provide potential targets for diagnosis and treatment. Valid next-generation sequencing (NGS) data of 93 COVID 19 samples and 100 non COVID 19 samples (GSE156063) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Gene ontology (GO) and REACTOME pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to identify the biological role of DEGs. In addition, a protein-protein interaction network, modules, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network, TF-hub gene regulatory network and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were used to identify the key genes. A total of 738 DEGs were identified, including 415 up regulated genes and 323 down regulated genes. Most of the DEGs were significantly enriched in immune system process, cell communication, immune system and signaling by NTRK1 (TRKA). Through PPI, modules, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network, TF-hub gene regulatory network analysis, ESR1, UBD, FYN, STAT1, ISG15, EGR1, ARRB2, UBE2D1, PRKDC and FOS were selected as hub genes, which were expressed in COVID-19 samples relative to those in non COVID-19 samples, respectively. Among them, ESR1, UBD, FYN, STAT1, ISG15, EGR1, ARRB2, UBE2D1, PRKDC and FOS were suggested to be diagonstic factors for COVID-19. The findings from this bioinformatics analysis study identified molecular mechanisms and the key hub genes that might contribute to COVID-19 infection and its associated complications.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.24.461631" rel="alternate" title="Screening key genes and signaling pathways in COVID-19 infection and its associated complications by integrated bioinformatics analysis (8 tweets)"/><category term="Bioinformatics"/><published>2021-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21263927</id><title>Antibody titers against the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 induced by BNT162b2 vaccination measured using automated chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (8 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.773797+00:00</updated><author><name>Hideaki Kato</name></author><author><name>Kei Miyakawa</name></author><author><name>Norihisa Ohtake</name></author><author><name>Hirofumi Go</name></author><author><name>Yutaro Yamaoka</name></author><author><name>Satoshi Yajima</name></author><author><name>Tomoko Shimada</name></author><author><name>Atsushi Goto</name></author><author><name>Hideaki Nakajima</name></author><author><name>Akihide Ryo</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levels of 50% neutralizing titer (NT50) reflect a vaccine-induced humoral immunity after the vaccination against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Measurements of NT50 are difficult to implement in large quantities. A high-throughput laboratory test is expected for determining the level of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed samples from 168 Japanese healthcare workers who had completed two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. We analyzed immunoglobulin G (IgG) index values against spike protein (SP) using automated chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay system AIA-CL and analyzed the background factors affecting antibody titer. SP IgG index was compared with 50% neutralization titers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The median SP IgG index values of the subjects (mean age = 43 years; 75% female) were 0.1, 1.35, 60.80, and 97.35 before and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the first dose, respectively. At 4 and 6 weeks after the first dose, SP IgG titers were found to have positive correlation with NT50 titer (r=0.7535 in 4 weeks; r=0.4376 in 6 weeks). Proportions of the SP IgG index values against the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants compared with the original strain were 2.029, 0.544, 1.017, and 0.6096 respectively.

We identified neuropsychiatric symptoms in intervals prior to, and following, this testing using a previously-derived set of ICD-10 codes and natural language processing terms. Primary analysis examined sociodemographic features associated with presence of at least one incident (i.e., new-onset) neuropsychiatric symptom between 90 and 150 days after an initial positive test for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 5058 children (50% female, 2.9% Asian, 6.3% Black, and 63% White; 30% Hispanic; mean age was 12.4 (IQR 8.9-15.6), 366 (7.2%) exhibited at least one new-onset neuropsychiatric symptom between 90 and 150 days following initial SARS-CoV-2 test positivity.

Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and full text of potentially relevant reviews, using a priori inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were systematic reviews examining effects of HVAC design features on virus transmission. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality using AMSTAR2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Searching identified 361 citations, 45 were potentially relevant, and 7 were included. Reviews were published between 2007 and 2021, and included 47 virus studies. Two earlier reviews (2007, 2016) of 21 studies found sufficient evidence that mechanical ventilation (airflow patterns, ventilation rates) plays a role in airborne transmission; however, both found insufficient evidence to quantify minimum mechanical ventilation requirements. One review (2017) of 9 studies examining humidity and indoor air quality found that influenza virus survival was lowest between 40% and 80% relative humidity; authors noted that ventilation rates were a confounding variable. Two reviews (2021) examined mitigation strategies for coronavirus transmission, finding droplet transmission decreased with increasing temperature and relative humidity. One review (2020) identified 14 studies examining coronavirus transmission in air-conditioning systems, finding HVAC systems played a role in virus spread during previous coronavirus outbreaks.

The approved vaccines are lifesaving yet temporary solutions to such a devastating pandemic. Viroporins are important players of the viral life cycle of SARS-Cov-2 and one of the primary determinants of its pathogenesis. We studied the two prominent viroporins of SARS-CoV-2 (i) Orf3a and (ii) Envelope (E) protein from a structural point of view. Orf3a has several hotspots of mutations which has been reported in SARS-CoV-2 with respect to SARS-CoV-1. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 Orf3a channel forming residues enhances the formation of a prominent the inter-subunit channel, which was not present in the SARS-CoV-1 Orf3a. This enhanced structural feature can be correlated with higher channelling activity in SARS-CoV-2 than in SARS-CoV-1. On the other hand, E protein is one of the most conserved protein among the SARS-CoV proteome. We found that the water molecules form networks of electrostatic interactions with the polar residues in the E protein putative wetted condition while no water channel formation was observed in the putative dewetted condition. This aqueous medium mediates the non-selective translocation of cations thus affecting the ionic homeostasis of the host cellular compartments. This ionic imbalance leads to increased inflammatory response in the host cell. Our results shed light into the mechanism of viroporin action, which can be leveraged for the development of antiviral therapeutics. Furthermore, our results corroborate with previously published transcriptomic data from COVID-19 infected lung alveolar cells where inflammatory responses and molecular regulators directly impacted by ion channelling were upregulated. These observations overlap with transcript upregulation observed in diseases having acute lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;One Sentence Summary&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Membrane permeation of Orf3a is significantly more in SARS-CoV-2 than in SARS-CoV-1 which might contribute to increased viral contagion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.26.461873" rel="alternate" title="Viroporin activity of SARS-CoV-2 Orf3a and Envelope protein impacts viral pathogenicity (7 tweets)"/><category term="Molecular Biology"/><published>2021-09-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.462373</id><title>SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern infect the respiratory tract and induce inflammatory response in wild-type laboratory mice (7 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.778440+00:00</updated><author><name>Shannon Stone</name></author><author><name>Hussin A.

These variants may also adapt to new hosts in part through mutations in the spike protein. In this study, we evaluated the infectivity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Six-week-old mice were inoculated intranasally with a representative virus from the original B.1 lineage or emerging B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 lineages. We also infected a group of mice with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (MA10). Viral load and mRNA levels of multiple cytokines and chemokines were analyzed in the lung tissues on day 3 after infection. Our data show that unlike the B.1 virus, the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 viruses are capable of infecting C57BL/6 mice and replicating at high concentrations in the lungs. The B.1.351 virus replicated to higher titers in the lungs compared to the B.1.1.7 and MA10 viruses. The levels of cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β) and chemokine (CCL2) were upregulated in response to the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 infection in the lungs. Overall, these data indicate a greater potential for infectivity and adaptation to new hosts by emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.462373" rel="alternate" title="SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern infect the respiratory tract and induce inflammatory response in wild-type laboratory mice (7 tweets)"/><category term="Microbiology"/><published>2021-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.21264328</id><title>Endemic Seasonal Coronavirus Neutralisation and COVID-19 severity (7 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.792117+00:00</updated><author><name>David A.

However, there are four known, endemic seasonal coronaviruses in humans (HCoVs) and whether antibodies for these HCoVs play a role in severity of COVID-19 disease has generated a lot of interest. Of these seasonal viruses NL63 is of particular interest as it uses the same cell entry receptor as SARS-CoV-2.We use functional, neutralising assays to investigate cross reactive antibodies and their relationship with COVID-19 severity. We analysed neutralisation of SARS-CoV-2, NL63, HKU1, and 229E in 38 COVID-19 patients and 62 healthcare workers, and a further 182 samples to specifically study the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and NL63.We found that although HCoV neutralisation was very common there was little evidence that these antibodies neutralised SARS-CoV-2. Despite no evidence in cross neutralisation, levels of NL63 neutralisating antibodies become elevated after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through infection or following vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.21264328" rel="alternate" title="Endemic Seasonal Coronavirus Neutralisation and COVID-19 severity (7 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.26.21264150</id><title>Changes in dispensing of medicines proposed for re-purposing in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia (7 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.797870+00:00</updated><author><name>Andrea L Schaffer</name></author><author><name>David Henry</name></author><author><name>Helga Zoega</name></author><author><name>Julian H Elliott</name></author><author><name>Sallie-Anne Pearson</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Purpose&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We quantified changes in dispensing of common medicines proposed for “re-purposing” due to their perceived benefits as therapeutic or preventive treatments for COVID-19 in Australia, a country with relatively low COVID-19 incidence in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We performed an interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study using nationwide dispensing claims data (January 2017-November 2020). We focused on six subsidised medicines proposed for re-purposing: hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ivermectin, colchicine, corticosteroids, and calcitriol (Vitamin D analogue). We quantified changes in monthly dispensing and initiation trends during COVID-19 (March-November 2020) using autoregressive integrated moving average models (ARIMA) and compared characteristics of initiators in 2020 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Result&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2020, we observed a 99% (95%CI 96%-103%) increase in hydroxychloroquine dispensing (of which approximately 30% attributable to new use), and a 201% increase (95%CI 186%-215%) in initiation, with a shift towards prescribing by general practitioners (42% in 2020 vs 25% in 2019) rather than specialists. These increases subsidised following regulatory restrictions on prescribing to relevant specialties. There was also a small but sustained increase in ivermectin dispensing over multiple months, with a 80% (95%CI 42%-119%) increase in initiation in May 2020 following its first identification as potentially disease-modifying in April 2020. Other than increases in March related to stockpiling among existing users, we observed no increases in initiation of calcitriol or colchicine during COVID-19. Dispensing of corticosteroids and azithromycin remained low after March 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most increases in dispensing observed early on during COVID-19 were temporary and appear to be related to stockpiling among existing users. However, we observed increases in initiation of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and a shift in prescribing patterns, indicating that a small proportion may be COVID-19 related.

For suppression of the spread of the virus infection among people, a procedure to inactivate virus in saliva may be useful, because saliva of infected persons is the major origin of droplets and aerosols that mediate viral transmission to nearby persons. We previously reported that SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly and remarkably inactivated by treatment &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt; with tea including green tea, roasted green tea, oolong tea and black tea. Tea catechin-derived compounds including theaflavins (TFs) with (a) galloyl moiety(ies) showed this activity. Although black tea is popularly consumed worldwide, a lot of people consume it with sugar, milk, lemon juice, and so on. But it has not been determined whether these ingredients may influence the inactivation effect of black tea against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it has not been revealed whether black tea is capable of inactivating variant viruses such as delta variant. Here we examined the effect of black tea on some variants in the presence or absence of sugar, milk, and lemon juice &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt;. Black tea and galloylated TFs remarkably inactivated alpha, gamma, delta and kappa variants. Intriguingly, an addition of milk but not sugar and lemon juice totally prevented black tea from inactivating alpha and delta variant viruses. The suppressive effect was also exerted by milk casein. These results suggest the possibility that intake of black tea without milk by infected persons may result in inactivation of the virus in saliva and attenuation of spread of SARS-CoV-2 to nearby persons through droplets. Clinical studies are required to investigate this possibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.461930" rel="alternate" title="Milk casein prevents inactivation effect of black tea galloylated theaflavins on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (7 tweets)"/><category term="Microbiology"/><published>2021-09-28T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.25.21264098</id><title>“Bringing testing closer to you” – Barriers and Facilitators in Implementing HIV Self-Testing among Filipino Men-Having-Sex-with-Men and Transgender Women in National Capital Region (NCR), Philippines: A Qualitative Study (7 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.803983+00:00</updated><author><name>Jeanno Lorenz G.

Furthermore, we explored the current knowledge, practices, and potential of HIVST among the MSM and TGW populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Design&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) were administered using semi-structured interviews administered in both English and Filipin. Thematic analysis of the findings was done after transcribing all audio recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Setting&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was done in the National Capital Region (NCR), Philippines using online video conferencing platforms due to mobility restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Participants&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;All study participants were either MSM or TGW, 18 to 49 years old, and residing/working in NCR. Exclusion criteria include biologically born female and/or currently on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), antiretroviral therapy (ART) medications, or an HIV-positive diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty informants were interviewed, of which 75% were MSM, and most of them preferred the use of HIVST. Facilitators and barriers to the use of HIVST were grouped into three main themes: Acceptability, distribution, and monitoring and tracking. Convenience and confidentiality, overcoming fears, and normalization of HIV testing services (HTS) in the country were why the participants preferred HIVST. Social media was recognized as a powerful tool in promoting HIVST. The use of a welcoming tone and positive language should be taken into consideration due to the prevalent HIV stigma. Informants also highlighted that confidentiality must be maintained throughout the whole HIVST process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The identified facilitators and barriers from the study may be considered by the Philippine HTS program implementers. The HIVST strategy may complement the current HTS. It will be very promising to involve the MSM and TGW communities and other key populations to know their HIV status by bringing testing closer to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS&lt;/title&gt;&lt;list list-type="order"&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gathering participants and building trust to give their insights did not pose any difficulty because the community-based organization is reputable among the key populations (MSM and TGW) and HIV advocacy in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study only involved respondents from the National Capital Region, which may limit its generalizability to other regions of the country where HIV cases are still increasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key informant interviews were done online due to the COVID-19 pandemic; thus, some reactions to the questions of the participants are not noted due to the unavailability of video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.25.21264098" rel="alternate" title="“Bringing testing closer to you” – Barriers and Facilitators in Implementing HIV Self-Testing among Filipino Men-Having-Sex-with-Men and Transgender Women in National Capital Region (NCR), Philippines: A Qualitative Study (7 tweets)"/><category term="HIV/AIDS"/><published>2021-09-28T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.20.461129</id><title>Context-aware deconvolution of cell-cell communication with Tensor-cell2cell (6 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.804193+00:00</updated><author><name>Erick Armingol</name></author><author><name>Hratch M.

Single-cell technologies measure the molecules mediating cell-cell communication, and emerging computational tools can exploit these data to decipher intercellular communication. However, current methods either disregard cellular context or rely on simple pairwise comparisons between samples, thus limiting the ability to decipher complex cell-cell communication across multiple time points, levels of disease severity, or spatial contexts. Here we present Tensor-cell2cell, an unsupervised method using tensor decomposition, which is the first strategy to decipher context-driven intercellular communication by simultaneously accounting for multiple stages, states, or locations of the cells. To do so, Tensor-cell2cell uncovers context-driven patterns of communication associated with different phenotypic states and determined by unique combinations of cell types and ligand-receptor pairs. We show Tensor-cell2cell can identify multiple modules associated with distinct communication processes (e.g., participating cell-cell and ligand receptor pairs) linked to COVID-19 severities. Thus, we introduce an effective and easy-to-use strategy for understanding complex communication patterns across diverse conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.20.461129" rel="alternate" title="Context-aware deconvolution of cell-cell communication with Tensor-cell2cell (6 tweets)"/><category term="Bioinformatics"/><published>2021-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.21264000</id><title>Pre-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 serological reactivity in rural malaria-experienced Cambodians (6 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.804389+00:00</updated><author><name>Jessica Manning</name></author><author><name>Irfan Zaidi</name></author><author><name>Chanthap Lon</name></author><author><name>Luz Angela Rosas</name></author><author><name>Jae-Keun Park</name></author><author><name>Aiyana Ponce</name></author><author><name>Jennifer Bohl</name></author><author><name>Sophana Chea</name></author><author><name>Maria Karkanitsa</name></author><author><name>Sokunthea Sreng</name></author><author><name>Huy Rekol</name></author><author><name>Char Meng Chour</name></author><author><name>Dominic Esposito</name></author><author><name>Jeffery K.

We investigated the impact of school opening with various mitigation measures (masks, rotations, mass testing) on growth rate of new cases in child cohorts ranging from kindergartens to upper secondary in Czechia, a country heavily hit by Covid-19, since April 2020 to June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our primary method is comparison of the reported infections in age cohorts corresponding to school grades undergoing different regimes. When there is no opportunity for such a comparison, we estimate corresponding coefficients from a regression model. In both the cases, we assume that district-level infections in particular cohorts depend on the school attendance and the external environment in dependence on the current overall risk contact reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The estimates of in-cohort growth rates were significantly higher for normally opened schools compared to closed schools. When prevalence is comparable in the cohorts and general population, and no further measures are applied, the in-cohort growth reduction for closed kindergartens is 29% (SE=11%); primary: 19% (7%); lower secondary: 39% (6%); upper secondary: 47% (6%). For secondary education, mitigation measures reduce school-related growth 2-6 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants and the ‘long covid’ risk, mitigation measures in schools, especially in secondary levels, should be implemented for the next school year. Some infections, however, are inevitable, even in kindergartens (where mitigation measures are difficult to implement) and primary schools (where they may not work due to low adherence).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264244" rel="alternate" title="Contribution of Schools to Covid-19 Pandemic: Evidence from Czechia (6 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.461862</id><title>ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine elicits monoclonal antibodies with potent cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 viral variants (6 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.809254+00:00</updated><author><name>Jeffrey Seow</name></author><author><name>Carl Graham</name></author><author><name>Sadie R.

Here we isolate a panel of 44 anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from an individual who received two doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine at a 12-week interval. We show that despite a relatively low serum neutralization titre, mAbs with potent neutralizing activity against the current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (B.1.1.7, P.1, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2) were obtained. The vaccine elicited neutralizing mAbs form 8 distinct competition groups and bind epitopes overlapping with neutralizing mAbs elicited following SARS-CoV-2 infection. AZD1222 elicited mAbs are more mutated than mAbs isolated from convalescent donors 1-2 months post infection. Spike reactive IgG+ B cells were still detectable 9-months post boost.

Virion structure is of interest, not only in the context of virus assembly, but also because pleomorphic variations may correlate with infectivity and pathogenicity. Detailed images of virus morphology often rely on electron microscopy, which is generally low throughput and limited in molecular identification. We have used fluorescence super-resolution microscopy combined with a rapid automated analysis pipeline to image many thousands of individual influenza virions, gaining information on their size, morphology and the distribution of membrane-embedded and internal proteins. This large-scale analysis revealed that influenza particles can be reliably characterised by length, that no spatial frequency patterning of the surface glycoproteins occurs, and that RNPs are preferentially located towards filament ends within Archetti bodies. Our analysis pipeline is versatile and can be adapted for use on multiple other pathogens, as demonstrated by its application for the size analysis of SARS-CoV-2. The ability to gain nanoscale structural information from many thousands of viruses in just a single experiment is valuable for the study of virus assembly mechanisms, host cell interactions and viral immunology, and should be able to contribute to the development of viral vaccines, anti-viral strategies and diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.461536" rel="alternate" title="High-throughput super-resolution analysis of influenza virus pleomorphism reveals insights into viral spatial organization (6 tweets)"/><category term="Microbiology"/><published>2021-09-24T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21262822</id><title>Plasma S-Adenosylmethionine is Associated with Lung Injury in COVID-19 (6 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.810425+00:00</updated><author><name>Evgeny Kryukov</name></author><author><name>Alexander Ivanov</name></author><author><name>Vladimir Karpov</name></author><author><name>Valery Alexandrin</name></author><author><name>Alexander Dygai</name></author><author><name>Maria Kruglova</name></author><author><name>Gennady Kostiuchenko</name></author><author><name>Sergei Kazakov</name></author><author><name>Aslan Kubatiev</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Objective&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) are indicators of global transmethylation and may play an important role as markers of severity of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The levels of plasma SAM and SAH were determined in patients admitted with COVID-19 (n = 56, mean age = 61).

Unique to this study is a multivariate approach that has yet to be fully explored by previous research.

Here we tested 411 sequential plasma samples collected up to 480 days post symptoms onset (d.a.o) from 214 convalescents of COVID-19 across clinical spectrum without re-exposure history after recovery and vaccination of SARS-CoV-2, using authentic SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization (MN) assays. COVID-19 convalescents free of re-exposure and vaccination could maintain relatively stable anti-RBD IgG and MN titers during 400∼480 d.a.o after the peak at around 120 d.a.o and the subsequent decrease. Undetectable neutralizing activity started to occur in mild and asymptomatic infections during 330 to 480 d.a.o with an overall rate of 14.29% and up to 50% for the asymptomatic infections. Significant decline in MN titers was found in 91.67% COVID-19 convalescents with ≥ 50% decrease in MN titers when comparing the available peak and current MN titers (≥ 300 d.a.o). Antibody-dependent immunity could also provide protection against most of circulating variants after one year, while significantly decreased neutralizing activities against the Beta, Delta and Lambda variants were found in most of individuals. In summary, our results indicated that neutralizing antibody responses could last at least 480 days in most COVID-19 convalescents despite of the obvious decline of neutralizing activity, while the up to 50% undetectable neutralizing activity in the asymptomatic infections is of great concern.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.18.21263550" rel="alternate" title="Persistent while declined neutralizing antibody responses in the convalescents of COVID-19 across clinical spectrum during the 16 months follow up (5 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.26.21264152</id><title>Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) in Treating Non-ventilated COVID-19 Patients with Moderate to Severe Hypoxia is Pharmacoeconomically Favorable When Appropriately Targeted (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.814983+00:00</updated><author><name>Matthew Poremba</name></author><author><name>Matthew Dehner</name></author><author><name>Alexandra Perreiter</name></author><author><name>Ashley Semma</name></author><author><name>Kimberly Mills</name></author><author><name>George Sakoulas</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior studies have shown that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19, but the high costs of IVIG leave questions as to its pharmacoeconomic value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital costs of 2 IVIG vs. non-IVIG COVID-19 patient groups were compared.

The second cohort consisted of patients enrolled in a previously published randomized open-label prospective study of 14 COVID-19 patients receiving standard of care (SOC) versus 13 patients who received SOC plus IVIG (Octagam 10%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the first case control population, mean total direct costs including IVIG for the treatment group was $21,982 per IVIG-treated case versus $42,431 per case for matched non-IVIG receiving controls, representing a net cost reduction of $20,449 (48%) per case. For the second (randomized) group, mean total direct costs including IVIG for the treatment group was $28,268 per case versus $62,707 per case for untreated controls, representing a net cost reduction of $34,439 (55%) per case. 24% of the non-IVIG patients had hospital costs exceeded $80,000, as compared to none of the IVIG patient host (p=0.016, Fisher exact test).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;When allocated to the appropriate patient type (moderate to severe illness without end-organ comorbidities and age &amp;lt;70 years), IVIG can significantly reduce hospital costs in COVID-19 care. More importantly, it may reduce the demand on scare critical care resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.26.21264152" rel="alternate" title="Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) in Treating Non-ventilated COVID-19 Patients with Moderate to Severe Hypoxia is Pharmacoeconomically Favorable When Appropriately Targeted (5 tweets)"/><category term="Health Economics"/><published>2021-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.26.21264135</id><title>Descriptive characteristics of continuous oximetry measurement in moderate to severe COVID-19 patients (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.816850+00:00</updated><author><name>Jonathan Aryeh Sobel</name></author><author><name>Jeremy Levy</name></author><author><name>Ronit Almog</name></author><author><name>Anat Reiner Benaim</name></author><author><name>Asaf Miller</name></author><author><name>Danny Eytan</name></author><author><name>Joachim A.

However, reports on SpO2 characteristics (patterns and dynamics) are scarce and none, to our knowledge, has analysed high resolution continuous SpO2 in COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;SpO2 signal sampled at 1Hz and clinical data were collected from COVID-19 departments at the Rambam Health Care Campus (Haifa, Israel) between May 1st, 2020 and February 1st, 2021. Data from a total of 367 COVID-19 patients, totalling 27K hours of continuous SpO2 recording, could be retrieved, including 205 non-critical and 162 critical cases. Desaturations based on different SpO2 threshold definitions and oximetry derived digital biomarkers (OBMs) were extracted and compared across severity and support levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Findings&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;An absolute SpO2 threshold at 93% was the most efficient in discriminating between critical and non-critical patients without support or under oxygen support. Under no support, the non-critical group depicted a fold change (FC) of 1 &lt;italic&gt;·&lt;/italic&gt;8 times more frequent desaturations compared to the critical group. However, the hypoxic burden was 1 &lt;italic&gt;·&lt;/italic&gt;6 times more important in critical versus non-critical patients. Other OBMs depicted significant differences, notably the percentage of time below 93% SpO2 (CT93) was the most discriminating OBM. Mechanical ventilation depicted a strong effect on SpO2 by significantly reducing the frequency (1 &lt;italic&gt;·&lt;/italic&gt;85 FC) and depth (1 &lt;italic&gt;·&lt;/italic&gt;21 FC) of desaturations. OBMs related to periodicity and hypoxic burden were markedly affected up to several hours before the initiation of the mechanical ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Interpretation&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first report investigating continuous SpO2 measurements in hospitalized patients affected with COVID-19. SpO2 characteristics differ between critical and non-critical patients and are impacted by the level of support. OBMs from high resolution SpO2 signal may enable to anticipate clinically relevant events, monitoring of treatment response and may be indicative of future deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Funding&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Milner Foundation, The Placide Nicod fundation and the Technion Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems center (MLIS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.26.21264135" rel="alternate" title="Descriptive characteristics of continuous oximetry measurement in moderate to severe COVID-19 patients (5 tweets)"/><category term="Intensive Care and Critical Care Medicine"/><published>2021-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.26.21264067</id><title>Effect of different disease-modifying therapies on humoral response to BNT162b2 vaccine in Sardinian multiple sclerosis patients (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.817297+00:00</updated><author><name>Maristella Pitzalis</name></author><author><name>Maria Laura Idda</name></author><author><name>Valeria Lodde</name></author><author><name>Annalisa Loizedda</name></author><author><name>Monia Lobina</name></author><author><name>Magdalena Zoledzwieska</name></author><author><name>Francesca Virdis</name></author><author><name>Giuseppe Delogu</name></author><author><name>Federica Pirinu</name></author><author><name>Maria Giuseppina Marini</name></author><author><name>Maura Mingoia</name></author><author><name>Jessica Frau</name></author><author><name>Lorena Lorefice</name></author><author><name>Maria Fronza</name></author><author><name>Daniele Carmagini</name></author><author><name>Elisa Carta</name></author><author><name>Valeria Orrù</name></author><author><name>Sergio Uzzau</name></author><author><name>Paolo Solla</name></author><author><name>Federica Loi</name></author><author><name>Marcella Devoto</name></author><author><name>Maristella Steri</name></author><author><name>Edoardo Fiorillo</name></author><author><name>Matteo Floris</name></author><author><name>Ignazio Roberto Zarbo</name></author><author><name>Eleonora Cocco</name></author><author><name>Francesco Cucca</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Objectives&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination against COVID-19 is highly recommended to patients affected by multiple sclerosis (MS); however, the impact of MS disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) on the immune response following vaccination has been only partially investigated. Here, we aimed to elucidate the effect of DMTs on the humoral immune response to mRNA-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in MS patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We obtained sera from 912 Sardinian MS patients and 63 healthy controls 30 days after the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine and tested them for SARS-CoV-2 response using anti-Spike (S) protein-based serology. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was assessed by anti-Nucleocapsid (N) serology. Patients were either untreated or undergoing treatment with a total of 13 different DMTs. Differences between treatment groups comprised of at least 10 patients were assessed by generalized linear mixed-effects model. Demographic and clinical data and smoking status were analyzed as additional factors potentially influencing humoral immunity from COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS patients treated with natalizumab, teriflunomide, azathioprine, fingolimod, ocrelizumab, and rituximab showed significantly lower humoral responses compared to untreated patients. We did not observe a statistically significant difference in response between patients treated with the other drugs (dimethyl fumarate, interferon, alemtuzumab and glatiramer acetate) and untreated patients. In addition, older age, male, sex and active smoking were significantly associated with lower antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2. MS patients previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 had significantly higher humoral responses to vaccine than uninfected patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humoral response to BNT162b2 is significantly influenced by the specific DMTs followed by patients, as well as by other factors such as previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, age, sex, and smoking status. These results are important to inform targeted strategies to prevent clinically relevant COVID-19 in MS patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.26.21264067" rel="alternate" title="Effect of different disease-modifying therapies on humoral response to BNT162b2 vaccine in Sardinian multiple sclerosis patients (5 tweets)"/><category term="Allergy and Immunology"/><published>2021-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.21264156</id><title>Inequalities in COVID-19 inequalities research: who had the capacity to respond?

Here we report the persistence of nAb responses over 12 months after infection despite its decreasing trend noticed from 6 months. The study included sera from 358 individuals who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 between January and May 2020. Samples were collected at 6 and 12 months after onset. The titers of IgG to the viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) and receptor-binding domain of the spike protein (RBD) were measured by CLEIA. The nAb titer was determined using lentivirus-based pseudovirus or authentic virus. Antibody titers of NP-IgG, RBD-IgG, and nAbs were higher in severe and moderate cases than in mild cases at 12 months after onset. While the nAb levels were likely to confer adequate protection against wild-type viral infection, the neutralization activity to recently circulating variants in some of the mild cases (∼30%) was undermined, implying the susceptibility of reinfection to the variants of concerns (VOCs). COVID-19 convalescent individuals have robust humoral immunity even at 12 months after infection albeit that the medical history and background of patients could affect the function and dynamics of antibody response to the VOCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.21264013" rel="alternate" title="Persistence of robust humoral immune response in COVID-19 convalescent individuals over 12 months after infection (5 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21263911</id><title>A MUC5B gene polymorphism, rs35705950-T, confers protective effects in COVID-19 infection (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.821684+00:00</updated><author><name>Anurag Verma</name></author><author><name>Jessica Minnier</name></author><author><name>Jennifer E Huffman</name></author><author><name>Emily S Wan</name></author><author><name>Lina Gao</name></author><author><name>Jacob Joseph</name></author><author><name>Yuk-Lam Ho</name></author><author><name>Wen-Chih Wu</name></author><author><name>Kelly Cho</name></author><author><name>Bryan R Gorman</name></author><author><name>Nallakkandi Rajeevan</name></author><author><name>Saiju Pyarajan</name></author><author><name>Helene Garcon</name></author><author><name>James B Meigs</name></author><author><name>Yan V Sun</name></author><author><name>Peter D Reaven</name></author><author><name>John E McGeary</name></author><author><name>Ayako Suzuki</name></author><author><name>Joel Gelernter</name></author><author><name>Julie A Lynch</name></author><author><name>Jeffrey M Petersen</name></author><author><name>Seyedeh Maryam Zekavat</name></author><author><name>Pradeep Natarajan</name></author><author><name>Cecelia J Madison</name></author><author><name>Sharvari Dalal</name></author><author><name>Darshana N Jhala</name></author><author><name>Mehrdad Arjomandi</name></author><author><name>Elise Gatsby</name></author><author><name>Kristine E Lynch</name></author><author><name>Robert A Bonomo</name></author><author><name>Mat Freiberg</name></author><author><name>Gita A Pathak</name></author><author><name>Jin J Zhou</name></author><author><name>Curtis J Donskey</name></author><author><name>Ravi K Madduri</name></author><author><name>Quinn S Wells</name></author><author><name>Rose DL Huang</name></author><author><name>Renato Polimanti</name></author><author><name>Kyong-Mi Chang</name></author><author><name>Katherine P Liao</name></author><author><name>Philip S Tsao</name></author><author><name>Peter W.F.

The analysis was performed within each ancestry group in the MVP, adjusting for sex, age, age&lt;sup&gt;2,&lt;/sup&gt; and first twenty principal components followed by a trans-ethnic meta-analysis. We then pursued replication and performed a meta-analysis with the trans-ethnic summary statistics from the HGI.

To date there have been four major variants (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta) that have tested the efficacy of the vaccines and have led to some breakthrough infections amongst vaccinated populations. Here, we evaluate the potency of a previously described mAb J08 against these variants using cell-based assays and delve into the molecular details of the binding interaction using cryo-EM. We show that mAb J08 is unique because it has low nanomolar affinity against the VoCs, binds high on the receptor binding domain (RBD) ridge and is therefore unaffected by most mutations, and can bind in the RBD-up and -down conformations. These findings further validate the phase II/III human clinical trial underway using mAb J08 as a monoclonal therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;One sentence summary&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monoclonal antibody J08 can potently neutralize wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern by binding to the ridge of the receptor binding domain in up and down conformations and thereby avoid the effects of current escape mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.462234" rel="alternate" title="Structural insights of a highly potent pan-neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 human monoclonal antibody (5 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.462109</id><title>Use of eVLP-based vaccine candidates to broaden immunity against SARS-CoV-2 variants (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.824979+00:00</updated><author><name>Jasminka Bozic</name></author><author><name>Tanvir Ahmed</name></author><author><name>Barthelemy Ontsouka</name></author><author><name>Anne-Catherine Fluckiger</name></author><author><name>Abebaw Diress</name></author><author><name>Tamara Berthoud</name></author><author><name>Xiaoyang Yuan</name></author><author><name>Lanjian Yang</name></author><author><name>Francisco Diaz-Mitoma</name></author><author><name>David E.

We produced VBI-2905a, an enveloped virus-like particle (eVLP)-based vaccine candidate expressing prefusion spike protein from the Beta variant that contains several escape mutations. VBI-2905a protected hamsters against infection with a Beta variant virus and induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies against Beta RBD. In a heterologous vaccination regimen, a single injection of VBI-2905a in animals previously immunized with VBI-2902, a vaccine candidate expressing S from ancestral SARS-CoV-2, hamsters were equally protected against Beta variant infection. As an alternate strategy to broaden immunity, we produced a trivalent vaccine expressing the prefusion spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 together with unmodifed S from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Relative to immunity induced against the ancestral strain, the trivalent vaccine VBI-2901a induced higher and more consistent antibody binding and neutralizing responses against a panel of variants including Beta, Delta, Kappa, and Lambda, with evidence for broadening of immunity rather than just boosting cross-reactive antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.462109" rel="alternate" title="Use of eVLP-based vaccine candidates to broaden immunity against SARS-CoV-2 variants (5 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.461909</id><title>Face masks impair reconstruction of acoustic speech features and higher-level segmentational features in the presence of a distractor speaker (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.825261+00:00</updated><author><name>Chandra Leon Haider</name></author><author><name>Nina Suess</name></author><author><name>Anne Hauswald</name></author><author><name>Hyojin Park</name></author><author><name>Nathan Weisz</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Face masks have become a prevalent measure during the Covid-19 pandemic to counteract the transmission of SARS-CoV 2. An unintended “side-effect” of face masks is their adverse influence on speech perception especially in challenging listening situations. So far, behavioural studies have not pinpointed exactly which feature(s) of speech processing face masks affect in such listening situations. We conducted an audiovisual (AV) multi-speaker experiment using naturalistic speech (i.e. an audiobook). In half of the trials, the target speaker wore a (surgical) face mask, while we measured the brain activity of normal hearing participants via magnetoencephalography (MEG). A decoding model on the clear AV speech (i.e. no additional speaker and target speaker not wearing a face mask) was trained and used to reconstruct crucial speech features in each condition. We found significant main effects of face masks on the reconstruction of acoustic features, such as the speech envelope and spectral speech features (i.e. pitch and formant frequencies), while reconstruction of higher level features of speech segmentation (phoneme and word onsets) were especially impaired through masks in difficult listening situations, i.e. when a distracting speaker was also presented. Our findings demonstrate the detrimental impact face masks have on listening and speech perception, thus extending previous behavioural results. Supporting the idea of visual facilitation of speech is the fact that we used surgical face masks in our study, which only show mild effects on speech acoustics. This idea is in line with recent research, also by our group, showing that visual cortical regions track spectral modulations. Since hearing impairment usually affects higher frequencies, the detrimental effect of face masks might pose a particular challenge for individuals who likely need the visual information about higher frequencies (e.g. formants) to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.461909" rel="alternate" title="Face masks impair reconstruction of acoustic speech features and higher-level segmentational features in the presence of a distractor speaker (5 tweets)"/><category term="Neuroscience"/><published>2021-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264242</id><title>Clinical Trial of Efficacy and Toxicity of Disoproxil Tenofovir Fumarate and Emtricitabine for Mild to Moderate SARS-CoV-2 Infections (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.825622+00:00</updated><author><name>E.A.G.

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with clinical suspicion of mild to moderate respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 who were treated at an outpatient clinic. Patients were randomly recruited to take 10 days of TDF (300 mg/day), TDF (300 mg/day) combined with FTC (200 mg/day) or placebo Vitamin C (500 mg/day). The primary parameter was the score of symptoms and predictive signs of COVID-19, assessed on the seventh day of patient follow-up. From a total of 309 patients with clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2, 227 met the inclusion criteria and were randomly distributed into the following groups: (a) 75 (one did not initiate treatment) in the TDF group; (b) 74 in the TDF combined with FTC group; and (c) 77 in the Vitamin C group (placebo). Of the 226 patients, 139 (62%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Fever (≥37.8°C), ageusia or dysgeusia, anosmia or dysosmia, and two or more clinical symptoms or signs were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. There was no significant change in clinical score based on clinical symptoms and signs between treatment groups. Patients with mild to moderate infection by SARS-CoV-2 had higher concentrations of G-CSF, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α compared to patients without infection. Patients with mild to moderate respiratory infection, with fever (≥37.8°C), loss of smell, loss of taste and two or more symptoms, have a better prediction for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 showed higher and more persistent proinflammatory cytokines profile compared to patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2. Pharmacological intervention with TDF or TDF combined with FTC did not change the clinical signs and symptoms score in mild to moderate respiratory infection in patients with SARS-CoV-2 compared to the Vitamin C group (placebo).&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264242" rel="alternate" title="Clinical Trial of Efficacy and Toxicity of Disoproxil Tenofovir Fumarate and Emtricitabine for Mild to Moderate SARS-CoV-2 Infections (5 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.462006</id><title>The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine induces polyfunctional T cell responses with features of longevity (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.826309+00:00</updated><author><name>Gisella Guerrera</name></author><author><name>Mario Picozza</name></author><author><name>Silvia D’Orso</name></author><author><name>Roberta Placido</name></author><author><name>Marta Pirronello</name></author><author><name>Alice Verdiani</name></author><author><name>Andrea Termine</name></author><author><name>Carlo Fabrizio</name></author><author><name>Flavia Giannessi</name></author><author><name>Manolo Sambucci</name></author><author><name>Maria Pia Balice</name></author><author><name>Carlo Caltagirone</name></author><author><name>Antonino Salvia</name></author><author><name>Angelo Rossini</name></author><author><name>Luca Battistini</name></author><author><name>Giovanna Borsellino</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown to be effective in preventing hospitalization for severe COVID-19. However, multiple reports of break-through infections and of waning antibody titers have raised concerns on the durability of the vaccine, and current discussions on vaccination strategies are centered on evaluating the opportunity of a third dose administration. Here, we monitored T cell responses to the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in 71 healthy donors vaccinated with the Pfizer–BioNTech mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) for up to 6 months after vaccination. We find that vaccination induces the development of a sustained anti-viral memory T cell response which includes both the CD4+ and the CD8+ lymphocyte subsets. These lymphocytes display markers of polyfunctionality, are fit for interaction with cognate cells, show features of memory stemness, and survive in significant numbers the physiological contraction of the immune response. Collectively, this data shows that vaccination with BNT162b2 elicits an immunologically competent and potentially long-lived SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell population. Understanding the immune responses to BNT162b2 provides insights on the immunological basis of the clinical efficacy of the current vaccination campaign and may instruct future vaccination strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.462006" rel="alternate" title="The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine induces polyfunctional T cell responses with features of longevity (5 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-09-28T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.25.21264082</id><title>Contact surveys reveal heterogeneities in age-group contributions to SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in the United States (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.826656+00:00</updated><author><name>Taylor Chin</name></author><author><name>Dennis M.

Quantifying population contact rates is important for understanding the impact of physical distancing policies and for modeling COVID-19, but contact patterns have changed substantially over time due to shifting policies and behaviors. There are surprisingly few empirical estimates of age-structured contact rates in the United States both before and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic that capture these changes. Here, we use data from six waves of the Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Survey (BICS), which collected detailed contact data between March 22, 2020 and February 15, 2021 across six metropolitan designated market areas (DMA) in the United States. Contact rates were low across all six DMAs at the start of the pandemic. We find steady increases in the mean and median number of contacts across these localities over time, as well as a greater proportion of respondents reporting a high number of contacts. We also find that young adults between ages 18 and 34 reported more contacts on average compared to other age groups. The 65 and older age group consistently reported low levels of contact throughout the study period. To understand the impact of these changing contact patterns, we simulate COVID-19 dynamics in each DMA using an age-structured mechanistic model. We compare results from models that use BICS contact rate estimates versus commonly used alternative contact rate sources. We find that simulations parameterized with BICS estimates give insight into time-varying changes in relative incidence by age group that are not captured in the absence of these frequently updated estimates. We also find that simulation results based on BICS estimates closely match observed data on the age distribution of cases, and changes in these distributions over time. Together these findings highlight the role of different age groups in driving and sustaining SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the U.S. We also show the utility of repeated contact surveys in revealing heterogeneities in the epidemiology of COVID-19 across localities in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.25.21264082" rel="alternate" title="Contact surveys reveal heterogeneities in age-group contributions to SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in the United States (5 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21264032</id><title>Modeling the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in a partially vaccinated population (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.826880+00:00</updated><author><name>Ugo Avila-Ponce de León</name></author><author><name>Eric Avila-Vales</name></author><author><name>Kuan-lin Huang</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;In a population with ongoing vaccination, the trajectory of a pandemic is determined by how the virus spreads in unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals that exhibit distinct transmission dynamics based on different levels of natural and vaccine-induced immunity. We developed a mathematical model that considers both subpopulations and immunity parameters including vaccination rates, vaccine effectiveness, and a gradual loss of protection. The model forecasted the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in the US under varied transmission and vaccination rates. We further obtained the control reproduction number and conducted sensitivity analyses to determine how each parameter may affect virus transmission.

We included individuals over 18 years of age. Independent variables included socio-demographic data of the participants and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination and pandemic. Our outcome variable was COVID-19 vaccination status, measured through “yes/no” answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most participants had been vaccinated against the COVID-19 (87.8%), while about half had been vaccinated against the influenza (52.5%). Multivariate analysis identified that increased age and higher level of education were associated with an increased likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination. Also, participants working in health services, participants without a previous COVID-19 diagnosis and those with previous seasonal influenza vaccination history had a greater probability to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, increased self-perceived severity of COVID-19, knowledge regarding COVID-19, and trust in COVID-19 vaccines and scientists were associated with COVID-19 vaccine uptake. On the other hand, the likelihood of vaccination was lower for participants who were more concerned about the side effects of COVID-19 vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the factors affecting individuals’ decision to take a COVID-19 vaccine is essential to improve the COVID-19 vaccination coverage rate.

Patients and outcomes were propensity score matching of factors which may affect COVID-19 infection rate and severity was performed. COVID-19 infections were confirmed through laboratory testing. Severe infection was defined as those who underwent tracheostomy, continuous renal replacement therapy, intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;R&lt;sc&gt;esults&lt;/sc&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 8070 individuals with positive covid-19 test and 12015 controls were identified. In people aged 60 or older, in those insured with Medicaid, and in the disabled, the proportion corresponding to the severe group of patients showed a tendency to increase. The infection rate of COVID-19 was highest in pulmonary disease (adjusted odds ratio 1.88, 95% confidence interval 1.70 to 2.03), and hyperlipidemia (0.73, 0.67 to 0.80) had a lower infection rate. Disease severity was highest in kidney disease (5.59, 2.48 to 12.63), and lower in hyperlipidemia (0.78, 0.60 to 1.00).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;C&lt;sc&gt;onclusions&lt;/sc&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is less bias as the government pays for all tests and treatments related to COVID-19 included in the data used in this study. Using propensity matching to reduce statistical bias, we found that most comorbidities increased the infection rate and severity of COVID-19, whereas hyperlipidemia reduced the rate and severity of infection.

Chest X-ray (CXR) is a faster, widely available, and less expensive imaging modality that may be useful in predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients. Artificial Intelligence (AI) may help expedite CXR reading times, and improve mortality prediction. We sought to develop and assess an artificial intelligence system that used chest X-rays and clinical parameters to predict mortality in COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;A retrospective study was conducted in Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, India. The study included patients who had a positive real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 and at least one available chest X-ray at the time of their initial presentation or admission. Features from CXR images and clinical parameters were used to train the Random Forest model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical data from a total of 201 patients was assessed retrospectively. The average age of the cohort was 51.4±14.8 years, with 29.4% of the patients being over the age of 60. The model, which used CXRs and clinical parameters as inputs, had a sensitivity of 0.83 [95% CI: 0.7, 0.95] and a specificity of 0.7 [95% CI: 0.64, 0.77]. The area under the curve (AUC) on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) was increased from 0.74 [95% CI: 0.67, 0.8] to 0.79 [95% CI: 0.72, 0.85] when the model included features of CXRs in addition to clinical parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Artificial Intelligence (AI) model based on CXRs and clinical parameters demonstrated high sensitivity and can be used as a rapid and reliable tool for COVID-19 mortality prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.22.21263956" rel="alternate" title="An artificial intelligence system for predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients using chest X-rays: a retrospective study (5 tweets)"/><category term="Radiology and Imaging"/><published>2021-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.24.21263766</id><title>The Report on China-Spain Joint Clinical Testing for Rapid COVID-19 Risk Screening by Eye-region Manifestations (4 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.830332+00:00</updated><author><name>Yanwei Fu</name></author><author><name>Feng Li</name></author><author><name>Paula boned Fustel</name></author><author><name>Lei Zhao</name></author><author><name>Lijie Jia</name></author><author><name>Haojie Zheng</name></author><author><name>Qiang Sun</name></author><author><name>Shisong Rong</name></author><author><name>Haicheng Tang</name></author><author><name>Xiangyang Xue</name></author><author><name>Li Yang</name></author><author><name>Hong Li</name></author><author><name>Jiao Xie</name></author><author><name>Wenxuan Wang</name></author><author><name>Yuan Li</name></author><author><name>Wei Wang</name></author><author><name>Yantao Pei</name></author><author><name>Jianmin Wang</name></author><author><name>Xiuqi Wu</name></author><author><name>Yanhua Zheng</name></author><author><name>Hongxia Tian</name></author><author><name>Mengwei Gu</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worldwide surge in coronavirus cases has led to the COVID-19 testing demand surge.

The convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based model was trained on these eye images to complete binary classification task of identifying the COVID-19 cases. The performance was measured using area under receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F1. The application programming interface was open access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Findings&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multicenter study included 2436 pictures corresponding to 657 subjects (155 COVID-19 infection, 23·6%) in development dataset (train and validation) and 2138 pictures corresponding to 478 subjects (64 COVID-19 infections, 13·4%) in test dataset. The image-level performance of COVID-19 prescreening model in the China-Spain multicenter study achieved an AUC of 0·913 (95% CI, 0·898-0·927), with a sensitivity of 0·695 (95% CI, 0·643-0·748), a specificity of 0·904 (95% CI, 0·891 -0·919), an accuracy of 0·875(0·861-0·889), and a F1 of 0·611(0·568-0·655).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Interpretation&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CNN-based model for COVID-19 rapid prescreening has reliable specificity and sensitivity.

Here, we build on existing studies characterizing early patterns of SARS-CoV-2 spread within the U.S. by analyzing detailed clinical, molecular, and viral genomic data from the state of Georgia through March 2020. We find evidence for multiple early introductions into Georgia, despite relatively sparse sampling. Most sampled sequences likely stemmed from a single introduction from Asia at least two weeks prior to the state’s first detected infection. Our analysis of sequences from domestic travelers demonstrates widespread circulation of closely-related viruses in multiple U.S. states by the end of March 2020. Our findings indicate that the early attention directed towards identifying SARS-CoV-2 in returning international travelers may have led to a failure to recognize locally circulating infections for several weeks, and points towards a critical need for rapid and broadly-targeted surveillance efforts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.19.21262615" rel="alternate" title="Unrecognized introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into the state of Georgia shaped the early epidemic (4 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-25T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.462156</id><title>Modulation of immunosuppressant drug treatment to improve SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy in mice (4 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.831246+00:00</updated><author><name>Amy V.

Avci</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically demonstrated the need for improved vaccination strategies and therapeutic responses to combat infectious diseases. However, the efficacy of vaccines has not yet been demonstrated in combination with commonly used immunosuppressive drug regimens. We sought to determine how common pharmaceutical drugs used in autoimmune disorders can alter immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We treated mice with five immunosuppressant drugs (cyclophosphamide, leflunomide, methotrexate, methylprednisolone, and mycophenolate mofetil), each with various mechanisms of action prior to and following immunization with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We assessed the functionality of antibody responses to spike protein and compared immune cell populations in mice that received no treatment with those that received continuous or temporarily suspended immune suppressive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All tested immunosuppressants significantly reduced the antibody titers in serum and functional antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in immunized mice. Temporarily halting selected immunosuppressants (methylprednisolone and methotrexate, but not cyclophosphamide) improved antibody responses significantly. Through proof-of-principle experiments utilizing a mouse model, we demonstrated that immune suppression in autoimmune disorders through pharmaceutical treatments may impair vaccine response to SARS-CoV-2, and temporary suspension of immunosuppressant treatment may be necessary to mount an effective antibody vaccine response. This work provides feasibility for future clinical assessment of the impact of immunosuppressants on vaccine efficacy in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunosuppressant regimens are widely used as therapies for a variety of diseases, including autoimmune, inflammatory, and cancer. However, immunosuppressants can impair critical immune responses to vaccination. The impact of standard immunosuppressant use on the critical, developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies has not been well-described. In this study, we use a mouse model to determine how different immunosuppressant drugs that act through different mechanisms can impair the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and how modulating these drug regimens may restore antibody levels and function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.462156" rel="alternate" title="Modulation of immunosuppressant drug treatment to improve SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy in mice (4 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.21.21263713</id><title>Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people experiencing homelessness in Toronto during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (4 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.831414+00:00</updated><author><name>Linh Luong</name></author><author><name>Michaela Beder</name></author><author><name>Rosane Nisenbaum</name></author><author><name>Aaron Orkin</name></author><author><name>Jonathan Wong</name></author><author><name>Cynthia Damba</name></author><author><name>Ryan Emond</name></author><author><name>Suvendrini Lena</name></author><author><name>Vanessa Wright</name></author><author><name>Mona Loutfy</name></author><author><name>Cindy Bruce-Barrett</name></author><author><name>Wilfred Cheung</name></author><author><name>Yick Kan Cheung</name></author><author><name>Victoria Williams</name></author><author><name>Miriam Vanmeurs</name></author><author><name>Andrew Boozary</name></author><author><name>Harvey Manning</name></author><author><name>Joe Hester</name></author><author><name>Stephen W.

This study reports the point prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during testing conducted at sites serving people experiencing homelessness in Toronto during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also explored the association between site characteristics and prevalence rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included individuals who were staying at shelters, encampments, COVID-19 physical distancing sites, and drop-in and respite sites and completed outreach-based testing for SARS-CoV-2 during the period April 17 to July 31, 2020. We examined test positivity rates over time and compared them to rates in the general population of Toronto. Negative binomial regression was used to examine the relationship between each shelter-level characteristic and SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates. We also compared the rates across 3 time periods (T1: April 17-April 25; T2: April 26-May 23; T3: May 24-June 25).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 8.5% (394/4657). Site-specific rates showed great heterogeneity with infection rates ranging from 0% to 70.6%. Compared to T1, positivity rates were 0.21 times lower (95% CI: 0.06, 0.75) during T2 and 0.14 times lower (95% CI: 0.043, 0.44) during T3. Most cases were detected during outbreak testing (384/394 [97.5%]) rather than active case finding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Interpretation&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the first wave of the pandemic, rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection at sites for people experiencing homelessness in Toronto varied significantly over time. The observation of lower rates at certain sites may be attributable to overall time trends, expansion of outreach-based testing to include sites without known outbreaks and/or individual site characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.21.21263713" rel="alternate" title="Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people experiencing homelessness in Toronto during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (4 tweets)"/><category term="Public and Global Health"/><published>2021-09-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264239</id><title>SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen in urine of hospitalized patients with Covid-19 (4 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.831697+00:00</updated><author><name>N Veyrenche</name></author><author><name>A Pisoni</name></author><author><name>S Debiesse</name></author><author><name>K Bollore</name></author><author><name>AS Bedin</name></author><author><name>A Makinson</name></author><author><name>C Niel</name></author><author><name>C Alcocer-Cordellat</name></author><author><name>AM Mondain</name></author><author><name>V Le Moing</name></author><author><name>P Van de Perre</name></author><author><name>E Tuaillon</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Introduction&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (N-Ag) can be detected in the blood of patients with Covid-19. In this study, we used a highly sensitive and specific nucleocapsid-Ag assay to explore the presence of N-Ag in urine during the course of Covid-19, and explore its relationship with the severity of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Material and Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urine and blood samples were collected from 82 patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection proven by PCR and included in the COVIDotheque. We explored the presence of N-Ag in urine and blood using the AAZ N-Ag test, studied the kinetics of the marker according to the time since the onset of symptoms and evaluated the association between N-Ag levels, clinical severity and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first and second weeks of Covid-19, hospitalized patients tested positive for urinary N-Ag (81.25% and 71.79%, respectively) and blood N-Ag (93.75% and 94.87%, respectively). N-Ag levels in urine and blood were moderately correlated with the number of days after the onset of symptoms (r=-0.43, p&amp;lt;0.0001; r=-0.55 p&amp;lt;0.0001, respectively). The follow up of seven SARS-CoV-2 infected patients confirmed the waning of N-Ag in urine and blood over the course of the disease. High urinary N-Ag levels were associated with the absence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-IgG (N-IgG), admission in intensive care units, high C-reactive protein levels, lymphopenia, eosinopenia, and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study demonstrate that N-Ag is present in the urine of patients hospitalized in the early phase of Covid-19. As a direct marker of SARS-CoV-2, urinary N-Ag reflects the dissemination of viral compounds in the body. Urine N-Ag is a promising marker to predict adverse evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264239" rel="alternate" title="SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen in urine of hospitalized patients with Covid-19 (4 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.21264298</id><title>A HOME-TREATMENT ALGORITHM BASED ON ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS TO PREVENT HOSPITALIZATION OF PATIENTS WITH EARLY COVID-19: A MATCHED-COHORT STUDY (COVER 2) (4 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.831947+00:00</updated><author><name>Elena Consolaro</name></author><author><name>Fredy Suter</name></author><author><name>Nadia Rubis</name></author><author><name>Stefania Pedroni</name></author><author><name>Chiara Moroni</name></author><author><name>Elena Pastò</name></author><author><name>Maria Vittoria Paganini</name></author><author><name>Grazia Pravettoni</name></author><author><name>Umberto Cantarelli</name></author><author><name>Norberto Perico</name></author><author><name>Annalisa Perna</name></author><author><name>Tobia Peracchi</name></author><author><name>Piero Ruggenenti</name></author><author><name>Giuseppe Remuzzi</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background and Aim&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;While considerable success has been achieved in the management of patients hospitalized with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), far less progress has been made with early outpatient treatment. We assessed whether the implementation of a home treatment algorithm – designed based upon on a pathophysiologic and pharmacologic rationale - during the initial, mild phase of COVID-19, could effectively reduce hospital admissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fully academic, matched-cohort study evaluated outcomes in 108 consecutive consenting patients with mild COVID-19 managed at home by their family doctors from January 2021 to May 2021, according to the proposed treatment algorithm and in 108 age-, sex-, and comorbidities-matched patients who were given other therapeutic schedules (&lt;ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov"&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/ext-link&gt;: &lt;ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="clintrialgov" xlink:href="NCT04854824"&gt;NCT04854824&lt;/ext-link&gt;). The primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospitalization. Analyses were by intention-to-treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;One (0.9%) patient in the ‘recommended’ cohort and 12 (11.1%) in the ‘control’ cohort were admitted to hospital (P=0.0136). The proposed algorithm reduced, by 85%, the cumulative length of hospital stays (from 141 to 19 days) and related costs (from € 60.316 to € 9.058). Only 9.8 patients needed to be treated with the recommended algorithm to prevent one hospitalization event. The rate of resolution of major symptoms was numerically, but not significantly, higher in the ‘recommended’ compared to the ‘control’ cohort (97.2% versus 93.5%, respectively; P=0.322).

The participant was divided into two groups based on RT-PCR results: COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 group. The proportion of positive signs &amp;amp; symptoms, rapid antibody test, abnormal findings in chest x-ray, and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) value were then compared between both groups. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy (DOR) were calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total 141 pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 cases were recruited for this study. This consist of 62 COVID-19 cases (43.9%) and 79 non COVID-19 pregnant women (56.1%). The sensitivity, spesificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic accuracy of each parameter are as follow: clinical sign &amp;amp; symptoms (24.19%, 75.95%, 3.92%, 96.11%, 65.87%), rapid antibody test (72.73%, 35.06%, 4.35%, 96.94%, 36.53%), chest x-ray (40.68%, 59.45%, 3.92%, 96.11%, 58.76%), and NLR &amp;gt; 5.8 (41.38%, 72%, 5.66%, 96.80%, 70.81%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of combined screening methods can classify pregnant women with high-risk COVID-19 before definitively diagnosed with RT-PCR.

We used electron microscopy based polyclonal epitope mapping (EMPEM) to characterize the antibody specificities against β-CoV spike proteins in sera from healthy donors (HDs) or SARS-2 convalescent donors (CDs). We observed that most HDs possessed antibodies specific to seasonal human CoVs (HCoVs) OC43 and HKU1 spike proteins while the CDs showed reactivity across all human β-CoVs. Detailed molecular mapping of spike-antibody complexes revealed epitopes that were differentially targeted by antibodies in preexisting and convalescent serum.

Here, serum of Beta variant infected patients revealed reduced cross-neutralization of non-VOC virus. From these patients, we isolated Beta-specific and cross-reactive receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibodies. The Beta-specificity results from recruitment of novel VOC-specific clonotypes and accommodation of VOC-defining amino acids into a major non-VOC antibody class that is normally sensitive to these mutations. The Beta-elicited cross-reactive antibodies share genetic and structural features with non-VOC-elicited antibodies, including a public VH1-58 clonotype targeting the RBD ridge independent of VOC mutations. These findings advance our understanding of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 shaped by antigenic drift with implications for design of next-generation vaccines and therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;One sentence summary&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant elicits lineage-specific antibodies and antibodies with neutralizing breadth against wild-type virus and VOCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.30.462420" rel="alternate" title="SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant infection elicits potent lineage-specific and cross-reactive antibodies (4 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.462344</id><title>Protection of Hamsters Challenged with SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern by Two Doses of MVC-COV1901 Vaccine Followed by a Single Dose of Beta Variant Version of MVC-COV1901 (4 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.833108+00:00</updated><author><name>Tsun-Yung Kuo</name></author><author><name>Chia-En Lien</name></author><author><name>Yi-Jiun Lin</name></author><author><name>Meei-Yun Lin</name></author><author><name>Chung-Chin Wu</name></author><author><name>Wei-Hsuan Tang</name></author><author><name>Ya-Shan Chuang</name></author><author><name>Luke Tzu-Chi</name></author><author><name>Charles Chen Liu</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The current fight against COVID-19 is compounded by the Variants of Concern (VoCs), which can diminish the effectiveness of vaccines, increase viral transmission and severity of disease. MVC-COV1901 is a protein subunit vaccine based on the prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-2P) adjuvanted with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide. Here we used the Delta variant to challenge hamsters innoculated with S-2P based on the ancestral strain or the Beta variant in two-dose or three-dose regimens. Two doses of ancestral S-2P followed by the third dose of Beta variant S-2P was shown to induce the highest neutralizing antibody titer against live SARS-CoV-2 of the ancestral strain as well as all VoCs. All regimens of vaccination were able to protect hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant challenge and reduce lung live virus titer. Three doses of vaccination significantly reduced lung viral RNA titer, regardless of using the ancestral or Beta variant S-2P as the third dose.

Moreover the combination of the five different IgG titers increased the correlation to the neutralizing antibody titers than if considered individually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiplex immunoassays have the potential to improve diagnostic performances, especially for ancient infection or mild form of the disease presenting weaker antibody titers.

Efforts to control such infections typically focus on the practice of strict contact-avoidance measures. Yet, contact rates and their relation to transmission, and the impact of control measures, are seldom quantified. Here, we quantify the response of contact rates, transmission and new cases of COVID-19 to public health contact-restriction orders, and the associations among these three variables, in the Canadian province of British Columbia (BC) and within its two most densely populated regional health authorities: Fraser Health Authority (FHA) and Vancouver Coastal Health Authority (VCHA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We obtained time series for self-reported close-contact rates from the BC Mix COVID-19 Survey, new reported cases of COVID-19 from the BC Center for Disease Control, and transmission rates based on dynamic model fits to reported cases. Our study period was from September 13, 2020 to February 19, 2021, during which three public health contact-restriction orders were introduced (October 26, November 7 and November 19, 2020). We used segmented linear regression to quantify impacts of public health orders, Pearson correlation to assess the instantaneous relation between contact rates and transmission, and vector autoregressive modeling to study the lagged relations among the three variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, declines in contact rates and transmission occurred concurrently with the announcement of public health orders, whereas declines in new cases showed a reporting delay of roughly two weeks. The impact of the first public health order (October 26, 2020) on contact rates and transmission was more pronounced than that of the other two health orders. Contact rates and transmission on the same day were strongly correlated (correlation coefficients = 0.64, 0.53 and 0.34 for BC, FHA, and VCHA, respectively). Moreover, contact rates were a significant time-series driver of COVID-19 and explained roughly 30% and 18% of the variation in new cases and transmission, respectively. Interestingly, increases in transmission and new cases were followed by reduced rates of contact: overall, average daily cases explained about 10% of the variation in provincial contact rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that close-contact rates were a significant driver of transmission of COVID-19 in British Columbia, Canada and that they varied in response to public health orders. Our results also suggest a possible feedback, by which contact rates respond to recent changes in reported cases. Our findings help to explain and validate the commonly assumed, but rarely measured, response of close contact rates to public health guidelines and their impact on the dynamics of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21263649" rel="alternate" title="Social contacts and transmission of COVID-19 in British Columbia, Canada (4 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-09-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.20.21263172</id><title>The kinetic of SARS-CoV-2 antibody (Ab) decline determines the threshold for Ab persistence up to one year (4 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.840570+00:00</updated><author><name>Erika Garner-Spitzer</name></author><author><name>Angelika Wagner</name></author><author><name>Michael Kundi</name></author><author><name>Hannes Stockinger</name></author><author><name>Anna Repic</name></author><author><name>Anna-Margarita Schoetta</name></author><author><name>Venugopal Gudipati</name></author><author><name>Johannes B.

Vaccination rollout is frequently supplemented with advisory from public health authorities for continuation of physical distancing measures. Compliance with these measures is waning while more transmissible virus variants such as Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2) have emerged. In this work, we considered a population where the waning of compliance depends on vaccine coverage. We used a SARS-CoV-2 transmission model which captures the feedback between compliance, infection incidence, and vaccination coverage to investigate factors that contribute to the increase of the prevalence of infection during the initial stages of the vaccination rollout as compared to no vaccination scenario. We analysed how the vaccine uptake rate affects cumulative numbers of new infections three and six months after the start of vaccination. Our results suggest that the combination of fast waning compliance in non-vaccinated population, low compliance in vaccinated population and more transmissible virus variants may result in a higher cumulative number of new infections than in a situation without vaccination. These adverse effects can be alleviated if vaccinated individuals do not revert to pre-pandemic contact rates, and if non-vaccinated individuals remain compliant with physical distancing measures. Both require convincing, clear and appropriately targeted communication strategies by public health authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns are in progress in many countries around the world. As the vaccination coverage increases, the compliance with physical distancing measures aimed at reducing virus transmission may decline. Using a socio-epidemiological model we identify factors that are the drivers of increased transmission when SARS-CoV-2 prevalence is higher than the projected prevalence without vaccination. To maximize the benefits of vaccination campaigns, compliance in vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups should be targeted prioritizing one group over the other depending on the vaccination rate, the efficacy of vaccine in blocking the infection, and the circulating variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.22.21263944" rel="alternate" title="The importance of sustained compliance with physical distancing during COVID-19 vaccination rollout (4 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-09-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.22.21263949</id><title>Who is at risk of poor mental health following COVID-19 outpatient management?

The objectives of our study was to phenotype individuals at highest risk of mental health disorders among COVID-19 outpatients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a binational online survey study with adult non-hospitalized COVID-19 convalescents (Austria/AT: n=1157, Italy/IT: n= 893). Primary endpoints were positive screening for depression and anxiety (PHQ-4, Patient Health Questionnaire) and self-perceived overall mental health and quality of life rated with 4 point Likert scales. Psychosocial stress was surveyed with a modified PHQ stress module. Associations of the mental health with socio-demographic variables, COVID-19 course and recovery data were assessed by multi-parameter random forest and serial univariable modeling. Mental disorder risk subsets were defined by self-organizing map and hierarchical clustering algorithms. The survey analyses are publicly available (&lt;ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://im2-ibk.shinyapps.io/mental_health_dashboard/"&gt;https://im2-ibk.shinyapps.io/mental_health_dashboard/&lt;/ext-link&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study cohorts, 4.6 (IT)/6% (AT) of participants reported depression and/or anxiety before to infection. At a median of 79 days (AT)/96 days (IT) post COVID-19 onset, 12.4 (AT)/19.3% (IT) of subjects were screened positive for anxiety and 17.3 (AT)/23.2% (IT) for depression. Over one-fifth of the respondents rated their overall mental health (AT: 21.8%, IT: 24.1%) or quality of life (AT: 20.3%, IT: 25.9%) as fair or poor. In both study collectives, psychosocial stress, high numbers of acute and persistent COVID-19 complaints and the presence of acute neurocognitive symptoms (impaired concentration, confusion, forgetfulness) were the strongest correlates of deteriorating mental health and poor quality of life. In clustering analysis, these variables defined a ‘high risk’ subset with particularly high propensity of post-COVID-19 mental health impairment and decreased quality of life. Pre-existing depression or anxiety was associated with an increased symptom burden during acute COVID-19 and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study revealed a bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 symptoms and mental health. We put forward specific acute symptoms of the disease as ‘red flags’ of mental health deterioration which should prompt general practitioners to identify COVID-19 patients who may benefit from early psychological and psychiatric intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Trial registration&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov"&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/ext-link&gt;: &lt;ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="clintrialgov" xlink:href="NCT04661462"&gt;NCT04661462&lt;/ext-link&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.22.21263949" rel="alternate" title="Who is at risk of poor mental health following COVID-19 outpatient management?

The mucosal antibody was IgA dominant. In the nasal epithelial lining fluid (NELF) of asymptomatic paediatric patients, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 1 (S1) specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) was induced early. Their plasma S1-specific IgG levels were higher than symptomatic patients. More adult with mild disease had NELF S1-specific IgA than those with severe/critical illness. Within the first week of diagnosis, higher S1-specific antibodies in NELF and plasma and lower vial loads were detected in paediatric than adult patients with mild disease. The IgA and IgG levels correlated positively with the surrogate neutralization readout. The detectable NELF ‘neutralizing’ S1-specific IgA in the first week after diagnosis correlated with a rapid decline in viral load.

Monitoring of wastewater is a useful tool for assessing community prevalence given that fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 occurs in high concentrations by infected individuals, regardless of whether they are asymptomatic or symptomatic. Using tools that are part of the wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) approach, combined with molecular analyses, wastewater monitoring becomes a key piece of information used to assess trends and quantify the scale and dynamics of COVID-19 infection in a specific community, municipality, or area of service. This study investigates a six-month long SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification in influent wastewater from four municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) serving the Charlotte region of North Carolina (NC) using both RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR platforms. Influent wastewater was analyzed for the nucleocapsid (N) genes N1 and N2. Both RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR performed well for detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 using the N1 target, while for the N2 target RT-ddPCR was more sensitive. SARS-CoV-2 concentration ranged from 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; copies/L for all four plants. Both RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR showed a significant moderate to a strong positive correlation between SARS-CoV-2 concentrations and the 7-day rolling average of clinically reported COVID-19 cases using a lag that ranged from 7 to 12 days. A major finding of this study is that despite small differences, both RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR performed well for tracking the SARS-CoV-2 virus across WWTP of a range of sizes and metropolitan service functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21258047" rel="alternate" title="Tracking the temporal variation of COVID-19 surges through wastewater-based epidemiology during the peak of the pandemic: a six-month long study in Charlotte, North Carolina (3 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-09-24T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21260526</id><title>Validation of the Panbio™ COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test (Abbott) to screen for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Sint Maarten: a diagnostic accuracy study (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.851206+00:00</updated><author><name>Colin King</name></author><author><name>Eva Lista-de Weever</name></author><author><name>Maria Henry</name></author><author><name>Radjin Steingrover</name></author><author><name>Chérina Fleming</name></author><author><name>Richard Panneflek</name></author><author><name>Sanne van Kampen</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Objectives&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Control of the pandemic has required countries to look for other forms of tests besides the gold standard real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Rapid antigen tests (RAT), though less sensitive than RT-PCR, offer the possibility of rapid, inexpensive and early detection of the most infectious COVID-19 cases. Only very few studies have assessed the performance of the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 RAT among asymptomatic people or in Latin America. This study set out to validate this test among people attending the public test street in Sint Maarten, Dutch Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;People of all ages were recruited from the public COVID-19 test street regardless of COVID-19 symptoms. They received a nasopharyngeal swab for the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 RAT and the RT-PCR Qtower. Diagnostic accuracy of the RAT was compared to the RT-PCR among the overall study population and for subgroups with/without symptoms, with/without close contact and different Ct values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a RT-PCR Ct cut-off value of &amp;lt;33, 119 out of 1,411 people (8.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Most were asymptomatic (59%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the RAT was 84% (95% CI 76.2-90.1) and 99.9% (95% CI 99.6-100) respectively. The sensitivity reduced to 67.6% (95% CI: 49.5%, 82.6%) among people without symptoms, regardless of whether they were in close contact with a known COVID-19 case.

To address this, we used a previously published model, combined with neutralization data for four vaccines - mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, NVX-CoV2373, and CoronaVac - to evaluate long-term dynamics of neutralizing antibody and to predict time-varying efficacy against the Delta variant by specific vaccine, age group, and clinical severity. We found that booster vaccination produces higher neutralization titers compared with titers observed following primary-series vaccination for all vaccines studied. We estimate the efficacies of mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 against Delta variant infection to be 63.5% (95%CI: 51.4-67.3%) and 78.4% (95%CI: 72.2-83.5%), respectively, 14-30 days after the second dose, and that efficacies decreased to 36.0% (95%CI: 24.1-58.0%) and 38.5% (95%CI: 28.7-49.1%) 6-8 months later. After administration of booster doses, efficacies against the Delta variant would be 97.0% (95%CI: 96.4-98.5%) and 97.2% (95.7-98.1%). All four vaccines are predicted to provide good protection against severe illness from the Delta variant after both primary and booster vaccination. Long-term monitoring and surveillance of antibody dynamics and vaccine protection, as well as further validation of neutralizing antibody or other markers that can serve as correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants are needed to inform COVID-19 pandemic preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21263715" rel="alternate" title="Prediction of long-term kinetics of vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibody and time-varying vaccine-specific efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant by clinical endpoint (3 tweets)"/><category term="Public and Global Health"/><published>2021-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.30.462514</id><title>Ad26.COV2.S Prevents SARS-CoV-2 Induced Pathways of Inflammation and Thrombosis in Hamsters (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.851877+00:00</updated><author><name>Malika Aid</name></author><author><name>Samuel J.

Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates type I interferon, myeloid, and inflammatory signatures similar to human disease, and that weight loss can be prevented with vaccines. However, the impact of vaccination on transcriptional programs associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis and protective adaptive immune responses is unknown. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 challenge in hamsters stimulates antiviral, myeloid, and inflammatory programs as well as signatures of complement and thrombosis associated with human COVID-19. Notably, single dose immunization with Ad26.COV2.S, an adenovirus serotype 26 vector (Ad26)-based vaccine expressing a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, prevents the upregulation of these pathways such that the gene expression profiles of vaccinated hamsters are comparable to uninfected animals. Finally, we show that Ad26.COV2.S vaccination induces T and B cell signatures that correlate with binding and neutralizing antibody responses. These data provide further insights into the mechanisms of Ad26.COV2.S based protection against severe COVID-19 in hamsters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Author Summary&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we show that vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S protected SARS-CoV-2 challenged hamsters from developing severe COVID-19 disease by attenuating excessive proinflammatory responses, such as IL-6 and IL-1, macrophages and neutrophils signaling. Ad26 vaccination also prevented the upregulation of pathways associated with thrombosis such coagulation and clotting cascades associated with infection, and the transcriptomic profiles of vaccinated animals were largely comparable to control uninfected hamsters. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 challenged unvaccinated hamsters showed significant increase of these proinflammatory and prothrombotic pathways and significant weight loss compared to vaccinated hamsters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.30.462514" rel="alternate" title="Ad26.COV2.S Prevents SARS-CoV-2 Induced Pathways of Inflammation and Thrombosis in Hamsters (3 tweets)"/><category term="Microbiology"/><published>2021-09-30T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.23.21264017</id><title>Assessing the impact of temperature and humidity exposures during early infection stages on case-fatality of COVID-19: a modelling study in Europe (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.852430+00:00</updated><author><name>Jingbo Liang</name></author><author><name>Hsiang-Yu Yuan</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although associations between key weather indicators (i.e. temperature and humidity) and COVID-19 mortality has been reported, the relationship between these exposures among different timing in early infection stages (from virus exposure up to a few days after symptom onset) and the probability of death after infection (also called case fatality rate, CFR) has yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We estimated the instantaneous CFR of eight European countries using Bayesian inference in conjunction with stochastic transmission models, taking account of delays in reporting the number of newly confirmed cases and deaths.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine induced humoral and cell-mediated immune response in patients previously treated with anti-CD20 antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Medrxiv and SSRN using variations of search terms “anti-CD20”, “vaccine” and “COVID” and included original studies up to August 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;,2021. We excluded studies with missing data on humoral or cell-mediated immune response, unspecified methodology of response testing, unspecified timeframes between vaccination and blood sampling or low number of participants (≤ 3). We excluded individual patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or incomplete vaccine courses. Primary endpoints were humoral and cell-mediated immune response rates. Pre-specified subgroups were time of vaccination after anti-CD20 therapy (&amp;lt; vs &amp;gt; 6 months), time point of response testing after vaccination (&amp;lt; vs &amp;gt; 4 weeks) and disease entity (autoimmune vs cancer vs renal transplant). We used random-effects models of proportions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Findings&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety studies were assessed. Inclusion criteria were met by 23 studies comprising 1342 patients. Overall rate of humoral response was 0.41 (95% CI 0.35 – 0.47). Overall rate of cell-mediated immune responses was 0.71 (95% CI 0.47 – 0.90). Longer time interval since last anti-CD20 therapy was associated with higher humoral response rates &amp;gt; 6 months 0.63 (95% CI 0.53 – 0.72) vs &amp;lt; 6 months 0.2 (95% CI 0.03 – 0.43); p = 0.001. Compared to patients with haematological malignancies or autoimmune diseases, anti-CD20 treated kidney transplant recipients showed the lowest vaccination response rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Interpretation&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients on anti-CD20 therapies can develop humoral and cell-mediated immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, but subgroups such as kidney transplant recipients or those with very recent B-cell depleting therapy are at high risk for non-seroconversion and should be individually assessed for personalized SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies.

A lot of people were out of jobs, many households were careful of their spending and a greater social fracture of the population in fourteen different countries has emerged. We considered periods of infection spread during the first and second wave in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and countries in Africa, that is developed and developing countries alongside their social-economic data. We established a mathematical and statistical relationship between Theil and Gini index, then we studied the relationship between the data from epidemiology and socio-economic determinants using several machine learning and deep learning methods. High correlations were observed between some of the socio-economic and epidemiologic parameters and we predicted three of the socio-economic variables in order to validate our results.

Musser</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The ARTIC Network provides a common resource of PCR primer sequences and recommendations for amplifying SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The initial tiling strategy was developed with the reference genome Wuhan-01, and subsequent iterations have addressed areas of low amplification and sequence drop out. Recently, a new version (V4) was released, based on new variant genome sequences, in response to the realization that some V3 primers were located in regions with key mutations. Herein, we compare the performance of the ARTIC V3 and V4 primer sets with a matched set of 663 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples sequenced with an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument. We observe general improvements in sequencing depth and quality, and improved resolution of the SNP causing the D950N variation in the spike protein. Importantly, we also find nearly universal presence of spike protein substitution G142D in Delta-lineage samples. Due to the prior release and widespread use of the ARTIC V3 primers during the initial surge of the Delta variant, it is likely that the G142D amino acid substitution is substantially underrepresented among early Delta variant genomes deposited in public repositories. In addition to the improved performance of the ARTIC V4 primer set, this study also illustrates the importance of the primer scheme in downstream analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Importance&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARTIC Network primers are commonly used by laboratories worldwide to amplify and sequence SARS-CoV-2 present in clinical samples. As new variants have evolved and spread, it was found that the V3 primer set poorly amplified several key mutations. In this report, we compare the results of sequencing a matched set of samples with the V3 and V4 primer sets. We find that adoption of the ARTIC V4 primer set is critical for accurate sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike region. The absence of metadata describing the primer scheme used will negatively impact the downstream use of publicly available SARS-Cov-2 sequencing reads and assembled genomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.461949" rel="alternate" title="Analysis of the ARTIC version 3 and version 4 SARS-CoV-2 primers and their impact on the detection of the G142D amino acid substitution in the spike protein (3 tweets)"/><category term="Bioinformatics"/><published>2021-09-28T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.29.21264261</id><title>World Science against COVID-19: Gender and Geographical Distribution of Research (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.854672+00:00</updated><author><name>Julio González-Álvarez</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;In just a year and a half, an enormous volume of scientific research has been generated throughout the world to study a virus/disease that turned into a pandemic.

Senegal, in particular, has been noted for its relative success in mitigating the spread and impact of COVID-19. We report original research findings on COVID-19 beliefs and prevention behaviors in a sample of Senegalese adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multi-modal cross-sectional study was conducted to describe COVID-19 beliefs and prevention behaviors in a sample of Senegalese adults and to identify potential predictors of prevention behaviors. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistics were generated to describe the sample and explore potential correlations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mask wearing, hand washing, and use of hand sanitizer were most frequently reported. Social distancing and staying at home were also reported albeit to a lower degree. We also identified a range of psychosocial and demographic predictors for COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Men, compared to women, had lower odds (OR=0.59) of reporting prevention behaviors. Rural residents (vs. urban; OR=1.49) and participants with at least a high school education (vs. less than high school education; OR=1.33) were more likely to report COVID-19 prevention behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Discussion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders and decision makers in Senegal and across Africa can use place-based evidence like ours to address COVID-19 risk factors and intervene effectively with policies and programming.

However, the relationship between microbiota and COVID-19 severity progression is still being assessed. This study aimed to analyse the diversity and taxonomic composition of the nasopharyngeal microbiota, to determine its association with COVID-19 clinical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods and Findings&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samples came from a retrospective cohort of adult patients with COVID-19, hospitalised in a tertiary centre. To study the nasopharyngeal microbiota, we utilized 16S rRNA sequencing. Raw sequences were processed by QIIME2. The associations between the microbiota, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and all-cause mortality were analysed by multiple logistic regression (OR; 95%CI), adjusted for age, gender, and comorbidity. 177 patients were included: median age 68.0 years, 57.6% males, 59.3% had a Charlson comorbidity index ≥3, and 89.2% with pneumonia. The microbiota α diversity indexes were lower in patients with a fatal outcome, and this association persisted after adjustment for the main confounders; whereas the β diversity analysis showed a significant clustering, grouping the patients with a fatal outcome. After multivariate adjustment, the presence of &lt;italic&gt;Selenomonas spp&lt;/italic&gt;., &lt;italic&gt;Filifactor spp&lt;/italic&gt;., &lt;italic&gt;Actinobacillus spp&lt;/italic&gt;., or &lt;italic&gt;Chroococcidiopsis spp&lt;/italic&gt;., was associated with a reduced risk of IMV (adjusted OR 0.06[95%CI 0.01–0.0.47], p = 0.007).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microbiota diversity and taxonomic composition are related to COVID-19 severity. Higher diversity and the presence of certain genera in the nasopharyngeal microbiota seem to be early biomarkers of a favourable clinical evolution in hospitalised patients with moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.461924" rel="alternate" title="Nasopharyngeal Microbiota as an early severity biomarker in COVID-19 hospitalised patients: a retrospective cohort study in a Mediterranean area (3 tweets)"/><category term="Microbiology"/><published>2021-09-28T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.21.21263883</id><title>Immune profile and responses of a novel Dengue DNA vaccine encoding EDIII-NS1 consensus design based on Indo-African sequences (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.864458+00:00</updated><author><name>Arun Sankaradoss</name></author><author><name>Suraj Jagtap</name></author><author><name>Junaid Nazir</name></author><author><name>Shefta E-Moula</name></author><author><name>Ayan Modak</name></author><author><name>Joshuah Fialho</name></author><author><name>Meenakshi Iyer</name></author><author><name>Jayanthi S Shastri</name></author><author><name>Mary Dias</name></author><author><name>Ravisekhar Gadepalli</name></author><author><name>Alisha Aggarwal</name></author><author><name>Manoj Vedpathak</name></author><author><name>Sachee Agrawal</name></author><author><name>Awadhesh Pandit</name></author><author><name>Amul Nisheetha</name></author><author><name>Anuj Kumar</name></author><author><name>Mohamed Shafi</name></author><author><name>Swathi Balachandra</name></author><author><name>Tina Damodar</name></author><author><name>Moses Muia Masika</name></author><author><name>Patrick Mwaura</name></author><author><name>Omu Anzala</name></author><author><name>Kar Muthumani</name></author><author><name>Ramanathan Sowdhamini</name></author><author><name>Guruprasad R.

The ongoing COVID pandemic highlights the need to tackle viral variants and expand the number of antigens and assess diverse delivery systems. To address some of these key issues, we have created a Dengue DNA vaccine candidate with the EDIII region as the key antigen given the promise of this segment in not causing ADE, a challenge with this disease. In addition, we have added the NS1 region to broaden the immune response. Following a large Dengue viral sequencing exercise in India, complemented with data from east Africa, our approach was to generate a consensus of four serotypes ED3-NS1 vaccine to explore tackling the issue of diversity. Our &lt;italic&gt;In silico&lt;/italic&gt; structural analysis of EDIII consensus vaccine sequence revealed that epitopes are structurally conserved and immunogenic across HLA diversity. Vaccination of mice with this construct induced pan-serotype neutralizing antibodies and antigen-specific T cell responses. Furthermore, the DNA vaccination confers protection against DENV challenge in AG129 mice. Finally, assaying of intracellular staining for IFN-γ, immunoglobulin IgG2(a/c) /IgG1 ratios as well as immune gene profiling suggested a strong Th1-dominant immune response. Our Dengue DNA platform with a focus on Indo-African sequences offers an approach for assessing cross reactive immunity in animal models and lays the foundation for human vaccine roll out either as a stand-alone or mix and match strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.21.21263883" rel="alternate" title="Immune profile and responses of a novel Dengue DNA vaccine encoding EDIII-NS1 consensus design based on Indo-African sequences (3 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.14.21263403</id><title>Evaluation Of A New “All In One” Sars-Cov-2 Antigen-Detecting Rapid Diagnostic Test And Self-Test: Diagnostic Performance And Usability On Child And Adult Population (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.865762+00:00</updated><author><name>Thierry Prazuck</name></author><author><name>Anne Gravier</name></author><author><name>Daniela Pires-Roteira</name></author><author><name>Aurelie Theillay</name></author><author><name>Sandra Pallay</name></author><author><name>Mathilda Colin</name></author><author><name>Raphael Serreau</name></author><author><name>Laurent Hocqueloux</name></author><author><name>Nino Guy Cassuto</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The control of the COVID-19 epidemics has been one of top global health priorities for the last eighteen months. To that end, more reliable and easy-to-use diagnostic tests are necessary. Young children are still not eligible to vaccination and it is important to find a way to easily test this key population regularly. With that in mind, we evaluated a new innovative easy two-step self-test named COVID-VIRO ALL IN&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; developed by AAZ that uses a sampling nasal sponge instead of a classic nasal swab. Mirroring the previous study conducted on the first generation of COVID-VIRO&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; antigenic self-test, we first performed a multicentre, prospective study on 124 adults and children, in a point-of-care setting. Sensitivity, specificity and overall acceptance of the COVID-VIRO ALL IN&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; antigen self-test compared to RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal samples were evaluated at 93.02%, 100% and 97,5%, respectively. We then performed a multicentre, prospective, usability study to evaluate the ease of use of COVID-VIRO ALL IN&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; in real life on 68 laypersons, all adults. Globally, 99% of them considered the instructions material good, 98% executed the procedure well, and all of them interpreted the results correctly. The usability was then specifically investigated on 40 children and teenagers participants, comparing both COVID-VIRO&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; first generation and the new COVID-VIRO ALL IN&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;. All of them found COVID-VIRO ALL IN&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; much easier to use and much more comfortable. For young children, the COVID-VIRO ALL IN&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; self-test appears to be safer (less risk of trauma compare to nasal swabs and no liquid exposure) easier to use than classic COVID self-tests and giving immediate result which is not the case for RT-PCR done on saliva samples (currently done in routine for kids in French schools). It could be an adapted tool for future mass screening campaigns in schools or at home under adult supervision for kids from the age of 3.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.14.21263403" rel="alternate" title="Evaluation Of A New “All In One” Sars-Cov-2 Antigen-Detecting Rapid Diagnostic Test And Self-Test: Diagnostic Performance And Usability On Child And Adult Population (3 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.20.461073</id><title>Personal care formulations demonstrate virucidal efficacy against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern: implications for hand hygiene (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.866232+00:00</updated><author><name>Sayandip Mukherjee</name></author><author><name>Carol K.

These VOC have rapidly spread through multiple geographies being enabled by high transmission rates and/or high viral load compared to the original parent strain. Consequently, the altered phenotypes of these VOC have posed greater challenges to diagnostic and clinical management of COVID-19. Despite considerable progress being made on vaccine roll out, practicing proper hand hygiene has been advocated as a consistent precautionary intervention as more virulent VOC continue to emerge and spread across geographies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two variants of concern, namely beta and delta, have recently been shown to escape antibody-mediated neutralization by virtue of acquired mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein which binds to the human ACE2 receptor for cellular entry. In this report we have empirically determined the efficacy of a range of personal care formulations in inactivating the beta and delta variants of SARS-CoV-2. High titres of these variants were exposed to marketed personal care formulations from Unilever under standard in-vitro suspension test-based conditions relevant to end-user habits. All the formulations demonstrated greater than 99.9% reduction in viral infective titres. The rate of inactivation by these products were comparable to that of the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus tested under the same conditions. Therefore, it can be concluded that well-designed personal care formulations when tested under consumer-centric conditions, and with proven efficacy against the parent strain of SARS-CoV-2 will continue to be effective against extant and emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. This is through their broad-spectrum mode of action (disruption of lipid bilayer of the host-derived viral envelope, denaturation of envelop and nucleocapsid proteins, and disruption of genome) which is independent of the escape mutations that facilitate immune evasion or enhanced transmissibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.20.461073" rel="alternate" title="Personal care formulations demonstrate virucidal efficacy against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern: implications for hand hygiene (3 tweets)"/><category term="Microbiology"/><published>2021-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.18.21263630</id><title>The International Sexual Health And Reproductive Health Survey (I-SHARE-1): A Cross-Sectional Multi-Country Analysis of Adults from 30 Countries Prior to and During the Initial COVID-19 Wave (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.868037+00:00</updated><author><name>Jennifer Toller Erausquin</name></author><author><name>Rayner K.

Primary outcomes included sexual behaviors, partner violence, and SRH service utilization, and we compared three months prior to and three months after policy measures to mitigate COVID-19. We used established indicators and analyses pre-specified in our protocol. We conducted meta-analyses for primary outcomes and graded the certainty of the evidence using Cochrane methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Findings&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Descriptive analyses included 22,724 individuals in 25 countries. Five additional countries with sample sizes &amp;lt;200 were included in descriptive meta-analyses. Respondents were mean age 34 years; most identified as women (15160; 66.7%), cis-gender (19432; 86.6%) and heterosexual (16592; 77.9%). Among 4546 respondents with casual partners, condom use stayed steady for 3374 (74.4%); 640 (14.1%) reported a decline. Fewer respondents reported physical or sexual partner violence during COVID-19 measures (1063/15144, 7.0%) than before (1469/15887, 9.3%). COVID-19 measures impeded access to condoms (933/10790, 8.7%), contraceptives (610/8175, 7.5%), and HIV/STI testing (750/1965, 30.7%). Pooled estimates from meta-analysis indicate during COVID-19 measures, 32.3% (95% CI 23.9-42.1) of people needing HIV/STI testing had hindered access, 4.4% (95% CI 3.4-5.4) experienced partner violence, and 5.8% (95% CI 5.4-8.2) decreased casual partner condom use (moderate certainty of evidence for each outcome). Meta-analysis findings were robust in sensitivity analyses that examined country income level, sample size, and sampling strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Interpretation&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial COVID-19 wave impacted SRH behaviors and access to services across diverse global settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Funding&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;United States National Institutes of Health, Latvia National Research Programme to Lessen the Effects of COVID-19&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Research in context Evidence before this study&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced billions of people to shelter in place, altering social and sexual relationships worldwide. In many settings, COVID-19 undercut already precarious health infrastructure and health service provision. However, there is limited evidence to date about changes to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) during the initial wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections (COVID-19 disease). Most studies have focused on high-income countries, rather than examining broader regional and global trends. To address this gap, our team organized a multi-country, cross-sectional online survey as part of a global consortium. Consortium research teams in 30 low, middle, and high-income countries collaboratively developed the survey instrument using existing measures and items adapted for COVID-19. Topics included sociodemographic characteristics; compliance with COVID-19 mitigation measures; couple and family relationships; sexual behavior; contraceptive use and barriers to access; access to reproductive healthcare; abortion; sexual violence and intimate partner violence (IPV); HIV/STI testing and treatment; and optional sections including female genital cutting and early marriage; mental health; and food insecurity. This multi-country, cross-sectional study aimed to better understand SRH prior to and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in participating countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Added value of this study&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted in thirty diverse settings during a pandemic. In addition to providing needed evidence about SRH during COVID-19 across low-, middle-, and high-income countries, the study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of a new framework for global health collaboration. Using an inclusive open science approach, we were able to harmonize key sexual health variables across countries. Our use of online data collection and large reliance on convenience sampling provides both challenges and opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Implications of all the available evidence&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This multi-country study provides detailed sexual and behavioral data across diverse global settings. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 measures during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic impacted sexual and reproductive health behaviors and access to services worldwide. In particular, our findings show a sizable proportion of people needing SRH services including HIV/STI testing and abortion reported that their access to these services was limited due to COVID-19 measures. These results suggest the need for expanded use of decentralized SRH interventions that can be implemented in emergency settings, such as self-testing, self-collection, and telemedicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.18.21263630" rel="alternate" title="The International Sexual Health And Reproductive Health Survey (I-SHARE-1): A Cross-Sectional Multi-Country Analysis of Adults from 30 Countries Prior to and During the Initial COVID-19 Wave (3 tweets)"/><category term="Public and Global Health"/><published>2021-09-27T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.18.21263783</id><title>The Delta Variant Had Negligible Impact on COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness in the USA (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.869486+00:00</updated><author><name>Ben Blaiszik</name></author><author><name>Carlo Graziani</name></author><author><name>James L.

Due to its high transmissibility, its prevalence in the U.S.A. grew from a near-zero baseline in early May 2021 to nearly 100% by late August 2021, according to CDC tracking. We accessed openly available data sources from the public health authorities of seven U.S. states, five U.S. counties, and the District of Columbia on RT-PCR COVID-19 tests split by the COVID-19 vaccination status of individuals tested during this period. Together, these time series enable estimation and tracking of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;) (against RT-PCR diagnosed infection) concurrently with the growth of Delta variant prevalence in those locations. Our analyses reveal that in each locality the VE&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; for the combined set of all three US vaccines remained relatively stable and quite well-performing, despite the dramatic concurrent rise of Delta variant prevalence. We conclude that the Delta variant does not significantly evade vaccine-induced immunity. The variations in our measured VE&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; appear to be driven by demographic factors affecting the composition of the vaccinated cohorts, particularly as pertains to age distribution. We report that the measured VE&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, aggregated across the collected sites, began at a value of about 0.9 in mid-May, declined to about 0.76 by mid-July, and recovered to about 0.9 by mid-September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Summary&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We estimated local COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness using RT-PCR COVID-19 test data broken out by vaccination status from select localities in the U.S.A. between 15 May and 15 September 2021 while the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was ascending from essentially zero prevalence to total dominance of the genome, and showed that the rise of the Delta variant had negligible effect on vaccine effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.18.21263783" rel="alternate" title="The Delta Variant Had Negligible Impact on COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness in the USA (3 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-09-22T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.20.21263823</id><title>Effects of testing and vaccination levels on the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and the prospects for its termination (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.869908+00:00</updated><author><name>Igor Nesteruk</name></author><author><name>Oleksii Rodionov</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;A simple statistical analysis of the accumulated and daily numbers of new COVID-19 cases and deaths per capita was performed with the use of recent datasets for European and some other countries and regions. It was shown that vaccination can significantly reduce the likelihood of deaths. However, existing vaccines do not prevent new infections, and vaccinated individuals can spread the infection as intensely as unvaccinated ones. Therefore, it is too early to lift quarantine restrictions in Europe and most other countries. The constant appearance of new cases due to re-infection increases the likelihood of new coronavirus strains, including very dangerous. As existing vaccines are not able to prevent this, it remains to increase the number of tests per registered case. If the critical value of 520 is exceeded, one can hope to stop the occurrence of new cases.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.20.21263823" rel="alternate" title="Effects of testing and vaccination levels on the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and the prospects for its termination (3 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264126</id><title>Efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.870581+00:00</updated><author><name>Ainsley Ryan Yan Bin Lee</name></author><author><name>Shi Yin Wong</name></author><author><name>Louis Yi Ann Chai</name></author><author><name>Soo Chin Lee</name></author><author><name>Matilda Lee</name></author><author><name>Mark Dhinesh Muthiah</name></author><author><name>Sen Hee Tay</name></author><author><name>Chong Boon Teo</name></author><author><name>Benjamin Kye Jyn Tan</name></author><author><name>Yiong Huak Chan</name></author><author><name>Raghav Sundar</name></author><author><name>Yu Yang Soon</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Objective&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compare the efficacy of COVID 19 vaccines between those with immunocompromised medical conditions and those who are immunocompetent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Design&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Data sources&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CORD-19 and WHO COVID-19 research databases were searched for eligible comparative studies published between 1 December 2020 and 3 September 2021.

Two reviewers independently screened for potentially eligible studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Data extraction&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary outcomes of interest were cumulative incidence of seroconversion after first and second doses of COVID vaccination. Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 antibody titre level after first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccination. After duplicate data abstraction, a frequentist random effects meta-analysis was conducted. Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;After screening 3283 studies, 42 studies that met our inclusion criteria were identified. 18 immunocompromised cohorts from 17 studies reported seroconversion in immunocompromised patients compared to healthy controls after the first dose and 30 immunocompromised cohorts in 28 studies reporting data after the second dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among immunocompromised groups, in incremental order, transplant recipients had the lowest pooled risk ratio of 0.06 (95%CI: 0.04 to 0.09, I^2=0%, p=0.81) (GRADE=Moderate) followed by haematological cancer patients at 0.36 (95%CI: 0.21 to 0.62, I^2 = 89%, p&amp;lt;0.01) (GRADE=Moderate), solid cancer patients at 0.40 (95%CI: 0.31 to 0.52, I^2 = 63%, p=0.03) (GRADE=Moderate) and IMID patients at 0.66 (95%CI: 0.48 to 0.91, I^2=81%, p&amp;lt;0.01) (GRADE=Moderate).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the second dose, the lowest pooled risk ratio was again seen in transplant recipients at 0.29 (95%CI: 0.21 to 0.40, I^2=91%, p&amp;lt;0.01) (GRADE=Moderate), haematological cancer patients at 0.68 (95%CI: 0.57 to 0.80, I^2=68%, p=0.02) (GRADE=Low), IMID patients at 0.79 (95%CI: 0.72 to 0.86, I^2=87%, p&amp;lt;0.01) (GRADE=Low) and solid cancer at 0.92 (95%CI: 0.89 to 0.95, I^2=26%, p=0.25) (GRADE=Low).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seroconversion rates and serological titres are significantly lower in immunocompromised patients with transplant recipients having the poorest outcomes. Additional strategies on top of the conventional 2-dose regimen will likely be warranted, such as a booster dose of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Systematic review registration&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROSPERO CRD42021272088&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264126" rel="alternate" title="Efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in immunocompromised patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis (3 tweets)"/><category term="Allergy and Immunology"/><published>2021-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264265</id><title>How a Positive COVID-19 diagnosis affects the physical, social and psychological wellbeing of people in the United Arab Emirates?

A sample of 30 participants of different age groups, gender, and nationalities were interviewed to explore the impact of a positive COVID-19 diagnosis on their physical, mental, social, psychological health, and lifestyle practices. An interview guide was created based on coping strategy model and conceptual framework of coping strategies. All interviews were recorded then transcribed after obtaining written consent from participants. Ethics approval was obtained from the United Arab Emirates Social Science Ethics Committee. NVIVO software was used for thematic analysis based on both identified coping models to highlight the most important feelings and emotions, family support, and changes in lifestyle that may impact the COVID-19 patient and family. Researchers identified the themes separately and then verified themes in one meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major themes include the physical effects, social effects, psychological effects, spiritual effects, and lifestyle effects. Emerging themes include coping mechanisms, trust in authorities and health care system, appreciation of the role of the government, conspiracy theories, and media roles. Those who had a positive infection towards the end of 2020 and in 2021 described having fewer negative emotions and better psychological resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study indicate that people diagnosed with COVID-19 have perceived a very good support in terms of their physical health from the government and health authorities, but require social, psychological, and educational support during the infection period and post-recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264265" rel="alternate" title="How a Positive COVID-19 diagnosis affects the physical, social and psychological wellbeing of people in the United Arab Emirates?

These include (&lt;italic&gt;a&lt;/italic&gt;) almost constant and low daily case rates over extended periods of time, (&lt;italic&gt;b&lt;/italic&gt;) sudden waves emerging from the above solution despite no or minimal change in the level of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and (&lt;italic&gt;c&lt;/italic&gt;) reduction or flattening of case counts following relaxation of NPI. To explain these phenomena, we add contact tracing to our recently developed cluster seeding and transmission (CST) model. We find no fewer than four effects which make prediction of epidemic trajectories uncertain. These are (&lt;italic&gt;a&lt;/italic&gt;) cryptogenic instability, where a small increase in population-averaged contact rate causes a large increase in cases, (&lt;italic&gt;b&lt;/italic&gt;) critical mass effect, where a wave manifests after weeks of quiescence with no change in parameter values, (&lt;italic&gt;c&lt;/italic&gt;) knife-edge effect, where a small change in parameter across a critical value causes a huge change in the response of the system, and (&lt;italic&gt;d&lt;/italic&gt;) hysteresis effect, where the timing and not just the strength of a particular NPI determines the subsequent behaviour. Despite these effects however, some non-obvious conclusions regarding NPI appear to be robust. In particular, (&lt;italic&gt;a&lt;/italic&gt;) narrowing the circle of one’s social interactions can be as effective a measure as reducing interactions altogether, and (&lt;italic&gt;b&lt;/italic&gt;) a good contact tracing program can effectively substitute for much more invasive measures. Finally, we propose the contact tracing capacity ratio – a metric of the load to which the tracers are subject – as a reliable early warning indicator of an imminent epidemic wave.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.21264174" rel="alternate" title="Counter-intuitive COVID-19 Trajectories – Explanations, Early Warning Indicator and Mitigation Strategies (3 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.21264211</id><title>Linguistic fairness in the U.S.: The case of multilingual public health information about COVID-19 (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.873498+00:00</updated><author><name>Damián E.

The COVID-19 pandemic has required rapid dissemination of essential guidance to diverse audiences and therefore provides an ideal context in which to study linguistic fairness in the U.S. Here we report a cross-sectional study of official non-English information about COVID-19 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and the health departments of all 50 U.S. states. We find that multilingual information is limited in many states, such that almost half of all individuals not proficient in English or Spanish lack access to state-specific COVID-19 guidance in their primary language. Although Spanish-language information is widely available, we show using automated readability formulas that most materials do not follow standard recommendations for clear communication in medicine and public health. In combination, our results provide a snapshot of linguistic unfairness across the U.S. and highlight an urgent need for the creation of plain language, multilingual resources about COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.21264211" rel="alternate" title="Linguistic fairness in the U.S.: The case of multilingual public health information about COVID-19 (3 tweets)"/><category term="Public and Global Health"/><published>2021-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.21264202</id><title>The effects of communicating uncertainty around statistics on public trust: an international study (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.873759+00:00</updated><author><name>John R.

However, the extent to which these findings apply in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic—rife with uncertainties—is unclear. In a large international survey experiment, (Study 1; &lt;italic&gt;N&lt;/italic&gt; = 10,519) we report that communicating uncertainty around COVID-19 statistics in the form of a numeric range (vs. no uncertainty) may lead to slightly lower trust in the number presented but has no impact on trust in the source of the information. We also report the minimal impact of numeric uncertainty on trust is consistent across estimates of current or future COVID-19 statistics (Study 2) and figures relating to environmental or economic research, rather than the pandemic (Study 3). Conversely, we find imprecise statements about the mere existence of uncertainty without quantification can undermine both trust in the numbers and their source – though effects vary across countries and contexts. Communicators can be transparent about statistical uncertainty without concerns about undermining perceptions of their trustworthiness, but ideally should aim to use numerical ranges rather than verbal statements.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.27.21264202" rel="alternate" title="The effects of communicating uncertainty around statistics on public trust: an international study (3 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-09-29T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.25.21264115</id><title>A Novel Penalized Inverse-Variance Weighted Estimator for Mendelian Randomization with Applications to COVID-19 Outcomes (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.874067+00:00</updated><author><name>Siqi Xu</name></author><author><name>Peng Wang</name></author><author><name>Wing Kam Fung</name></author><author><name>Zhonghua Liu</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Mendelian randomization (MR) utilizes genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to estimate the causal effect of an exposure variable on an outcome of interest even in the presence of unmeasured confounders. However, the popular inverse-variance weighted (IVW) estimator could be biased in the presence of weak IVs, a common challenge in MR studies. In this article, we develop a novel penalized inverse-variance weighted (pIVW) estimator, which adjusts the original IVW estimator to account for the weak IV issue by using a penalization approach to prevent the denominator of the pIVW estimator from being close to zero. Moreover, we adjust the variance estimation of the pIVW estimator to account for the presence of horizontal pleiotropy. We show that the recently proposed debiased IVW (dIVW) estimator is a special case of our proposed pIVW estimator. We further prove that the pIVW estimator has smaller bias and variance than the dIVW estimator under some regularity conditions. We also conduct extensive simulation studies to demonstrate the performance of the proposed pIVW estimator. Furthermore, we apply the pIVW estimator to estimate the causal effects of five obesity-related exposures on three coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. Notably, we find that hypertensive disease is associated with an increased risk of hospitalized COVID-19, and peripheral vascular disease and higher body mass index are associated with increased risks of COVID-19 infection, hospitalized COVID-19 and critically ill COVID-19.

The rapid outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is largely due to its high transmission capacity. Studies implied that the cold chain logistics would be a potential route for the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The low temperature condition of the cold chain is conducive to survival and transmission of virus. Thus, the virus disinfection in cold chain should not be neglected for controlling COVID-19. However, due to the low temperature feature of the cold-chain, the virus disinfecting methods suitable in cold chain are limited. Here the high-energy electron beam irradiation is proposed to disinfect the SARS-CoV-2 in cold chain logistics. We evaluated the impact of high-energy electron beam irradiation on porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enveloped virus surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, and explored the possible mechanism of the action of high-energy electron beam irradiation on PEDV. The irradiation dose of 10 kGy inactivated 98.1 % PEDV on the both top and bottom surfaces of various packaging materials under cold chain frozen condition. High-energy electron beam inactivated PEDV by inducing damages on viral genome or even capsid.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.25.461766" rel="alternate" title="Deactivation of SARS-CoV-2 surrogate porcine epidemic diarrhea virus with electron beam irradiation under the cold chain transportation condition (3 tweets)"/><category term="Microbiology"/><published>2021-09-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.24.21263978</id><title>Lower probability and shorter duration of infections after Covid-19 vaccine correlate with anti-SARS-CoV-2 circulating IgGs (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-07T08:46:54.874602+00:00</updated><author><name>Chiara Ronchini</name></author><author><name>Sara Gandini</name></author><author><name>Sebastiano Pasqualato</name></author><author><name>Luca Mazzarella</name></author><author><name>Federica Facciotti</name></author><author><name>Marina Mapelli</name></author><author><name>Gianmaria Frige</name></author><author><name>Rita Passerini</name></author><author><name>Luca Pase</name></author><author><name>Silvio Capizzi</name></author><author><name>Fabrizio Mastrilli</name></author><author><name>Roberto Orecchia</name></author><author><name>Gioacchino Natoli</name></author><author><name>Pier Giuseppe Pelicci</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The correlation between immune responses and protection from SARS-CoV-2 infections and its duration remains unclear.
