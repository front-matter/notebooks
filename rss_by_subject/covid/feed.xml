Our goal was to leverage real-world data spanning two COVID-19 surges over the first year of the pandemic to determine the temporal trend of in-hospital mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Design&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was an observational, retrospective study based on real-world data for patients admitted with COVID-19. Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to evaluate the association of covariates with the composite outcome over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Setting and Population&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified a retrospective cohort of all patients who were hospitalized within the Yale New Haven Health (YNHH) system with an admission diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and February 28, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Main outcome&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary outcome for the study was a composite endpoint of in-hospital mortality, defined as death during the index hospitalization or discharge to hospice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 6,477 discharges over the study period, the mean age was 66.2 years (SD=17.6), 52.5% (n=3,401) were male and the overall composite mortality was 14.2% (n=920). Composite in-hospital mortality was significantly associated with increased age, comorbidity index, respiratory rate, and heart rate; decreased systolic blood pressure; male sex; and admission from a long-term care facility (LTCF). The significant temporal decrease in mortality that was observed for patients admitted from a location other than a LTCF was not seen in those admitted from a LTCF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that the adjusted in-hospital mortality rate declined over the first year of the pandemic, despite a second surge in COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Importantly, the decrease in mortality appeared to be driven by declines in risk in those not admitted from a LTCF. The observed decrease in mortality over time suggests that improved outcomes may be due to progressive, incremental learning and continuous evolution in hospital practice and policy over the course of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><published>2021-05-04T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.29.21256332</id><title>System inference via field inversion for the spatio-temporal progression of infectious diseases: Studies of COVID-19 in Michigan and Mexico (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-09T14:38:49.418691+00:00</updated><author><name>Z.

Garikipati</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;We present an approach to studying and predicting the spatio-temporal progression of infectious diseases. We treat the problem by adopting a partial differential equation (PDE) version of the Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, Deceased (SIRD) compartmental model of epidemiology, which is achieved by replacing compartmental populations by their densities. Building on our recent work (&lt;italic&gt;Computational Mechanics&lt;/italic&gt;, &lt;bold&gt;66&lt;/bold&gt;, 1177, 2020), we replace our earlier use of global polynomial basis functions with those having local support, as epitomized in the finite element method, for the spatial representation of the SIRD parameters. The time dependence is treated by inferring constant parameters over time intervals that coincide with the time step in semi-discrete numerical implementations. In combination, this amounts to a scheme of field inversion of the SIRD parameters over each time step. Applied to data over ten months of 2020 for the pandemic in the US state of Michigan and to all of Mexico, our system inference via field inversion infers spatio-temporally varying PDE SIRD parameters that replicate the progression of the pandemic with high accuracy. It also produces accurate predictions, when compared against data, for a three week period into 2021. Of note is the insight that is suggested on the spatio-temporal variation of infection, recovery and death rates, as well as patterns of the population’s mobility revealed by diffusivities of the compartments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><published>2021-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.02.442313</id><title>Immunoinformatics approach for a novel multi-epitope vaccine construct against spike protein of human coronaviruses (7 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-09T14:38:49.418122+00:00</updated><author><name>Avinash Kumar</name></author><author><name>Ekta Rathi</name></author><author><name>Suvarna G Kini</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Spike (S) proteins are an attractive target as it mediates the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 to the host through ACE-2 receptors. We hypothesize that the screening of S protein sequences of all the HCoVs would result in the identification of potential multi-epitope vaccine candidates capable of conferring immunity against various HCoVs. In the present study, several machine learning-based &lt;italic&gt;in-silico&lt;/italic&gt; tools were employed to design a broad-spectrum multi-epitope vaccine candidate against S protein of human coronaviruses. To the best of our knowledge, it is one of the first study, where multiple B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes (CTL and HTL) were predicted from the S protein sequences of all seven known HCoVs and linked together with an adjuvant to construct a potential broad-spectrum vaccine candidate. Secondary and tertiary structures were predicted, validated and the refined 3D-model was docked with an immune receptor. The vaccine candidate was evaluated for antigenicity, allergenicity, solubility, and its ability to achieve high-level expression in bacterial hosts. Finally, the immune simulation was carried out to evaluate the immune response after three vaccine doses. The designed vaccine is antigenic (with or without the adjuvant), non-allergenic, binds well with TLR-3 receptor and might elicit a diverse and strong immune response.&lt;/p&gt;</content><published>2021-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.04.21256298</id><title>Fatal cytokine release syndrome by an aberrant FLIP/STAT3 axis (8 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-09T14:38:49.417085+00:00</updated><author><name>Chiara Musiu</name></author><author><name>Simone Caligola</name></author><author><name>Alessandra Fiore</name></author><author><name>Alessia Lamolinara</name></author><author><name>Cristina Frusteri</name></author><author><name>Francesco Domenico Del Pizzo</name></author><author><name>Francesco De Sanctis</name></author><author><name>Stefania Canè</name></author><author><name>Annalisa Adamo</name></author><author><name>Francesca Hofer</name></author><author><name>Roza Maria Barouni</name></author><author><name>Andrea Grilli</name></author><author><name>Serena Zilio</name></author><author><name>Paolo Serafini</name></author><author><name>Evelina Tacconelli</name></author><author><name>Katia Donadello</name></author><author><name>Leonardo Gottin</name></author><author><name>Enrico Polati</name></author><author><name>Domenico Girelli</name></author><author><name>Ildo Polidoro</name></author><author><name>Piera Amelia Iezzi</name></author><author><name>Domenico Angelucci</name></author><author><name>Andrea Capece</name></author><author><name>Ying Chen</name></author><author><name>Zheng-Li Shi</name></author><author><name>Peter J.

However, dysregulated anti-pathogen immune responses can provoke life-threatening inflammatory pathologies collectively known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), exemplified by key clinical phenotypes unearthed during the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. The underlying pathophysiology of CRS remains elusive. We found that FLIP, a protein that controls caspase-8 death pathways, was highly expressed in myeloid cells of COVID-19 lungs. FLIP controlled CRS by fueling a STAT3-dependent inflammatory program. Indeed, constitutive expression of a viral FLIP homologue in myeloid cells triggered a STAT3-linked, progressive and fatal inflammatory syndrome in mice, characterized by elevated cytokine output, lymphopenia, lung injury and multiple organ dysfunctions that mimicked human CRS. As STAT3-targeting approaches relieved inflammation, immune disorders, and organ failures in these mice, targeted intervention towards this pathway could suppress the lethal CRS inflammatory state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;One sentence summary&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;FLIP-expressing myeloid cells are key drivers of CRS through aberrant overexpression of STAT3 pathway. STAT3-targeting is effective in mitigating CRS like severe COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><published>2021-05-04T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.28.21256277</id><title>Serum Neurofilament Light is Elevated in COVID-19 Positive Adults in the ICU and is Associated with Co-Morbid Cardiovascular Disease, Neurological Complications, and Acuity of Illness (10 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-09T14:38:49.337469+00:00</updated><author><name>Meredith Hay</name></author><author><name>Lee Ryan</name></author><author><name>Matthew Huentelman</name></author><author><name>John Konhilas</name></author><author><name>Christina Hoyer-Kimura</name></author><author><name>Thomas G.

While recent studies have identified that there is an increase in structural injury to the nervous system in critically ill COVID-19 patients, there is little known about the relationship of COVID-19 neurological damage to the systemic inflammatory diseases also observed in COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this pilot observational study was to examine the relationships between serum neurofilament light protein (NfL, a measure of neuronal injury) and co-morbid cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neurological complications in COVID-19 positive patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). In this observational study of one-hundred patients who were admitted to the ICU in Tucson, Arizona between April and August 2020, 89 were positive for COVID-19 (COVID-pos) and 11 were COVID-negative (COVID-neg). A healthy control group (n=8) was examined for comparison. The primary outcomes and measures were subject demographics, serum NfL, presence and extent of CVD, diabetes, sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA), presence of neurological complications, and blood chemistry panel data. COVID-pos patients in the ICU had significantly higher mean levels of Nfl (229.6±163 pg/ml) compared to COVID-neg ICU patients (19.3±5.6 pg/ml), Welch’s t-test, p =.01 and healthy controls (12.3±3.1 pg/ml), Welch’s t-test p =.005. Levels of Nfl in COVID-pos ICU patients were significantly higher in patients with concomitant CVD and diabetes (n=35, log Nfl 1.6±.09), and correlated with higher SOFA scores (r=.5, p =.001). These findings suggest that in severe COVID-19 disease, the central neuronal and axonal damage in these patients may be driven, in part, by the level of systemic cardiovascular disease and peripheral inflammation. Understanding the contributions of systemic inflammatory disease to central neurological degeneration in these COVID-19 survivors will be important to the design of interventional therapies to prevent long-term neurological and cognitive dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content><published>2021-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.04.21256107</id><title>Environmental Screening for Surface SARS-CoV-2 Contamination in Urban High-Touch Areas (11 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-09T14:38:49.337081+00:00</updated><author><name>Lauren Roppolo Brazell</name></author><author><name>Shawna Stetz</name></author><author><name>Adam Hipp</name></author><author><name>Samantha Taylor</name></author><author><name>Nicholas Stark</name></author><author><name>Katherine Jensen</name></author><author><name>Md Ariful Islam Juel</name></author><author><name>Patrick Deegan</name></author><author><name>Mariya Munir</name></author><author><name>Jessica Schlueter</name></author><author><name>Jennifer Weller</name></author><author><name>Cynthia Gibas</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The novel human coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak, which reached pandemic-level infection rates in just a few short months after being identified in late 2019. Early transmission models focused on surface contamination, but current research provides evidence for person-to-person transmission via aerosolized viral particles. As such, the CDC’s guidance has recently been updated to increasingly redirect the focus of prevention methods to aerosol routes. Inhalation of SARS-CoV-2 particles presents the most significant threat of infection to individuals. A secondary route, from hand to mouth, eyes or nose, is likely after contact with a surface contaminated with particles that have settled out of aerosols or been deposited by contaminated hands. Using common molecular detection methods including endpoint and quantitative PCR, we investigated whether there is detectable contamination by SARS-CoV-2 on high-touch surfaces on public transit vehicles and on other high-touch surfaces on a college campus during normal use. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can be successfully recovered and detected on common high-touch surfaces, albeit in comparatively lower frequencies as public health guidance progressed and more rigorous sanitization procedures were implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Abstract Figure&lt;/title&gt;&lt;fig id="ufig1" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"&gt;&lt;graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="21256107v1_ufig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" /&gt;&lt;/fig&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;bold&gt;Graphical abstract created with permission from &lt;ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://BioRender.com"&gt;BioRender.com&lt;/ext-link&gt; (2021)&lt;/bold&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><published>2021-05-04T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.05.442742</id><title>Sequencing SARS-CoV-2 in a malaria research laboratory in Mali, West Africa: the road to sequencing the first SARS-CoV-2 genome in Mali (13 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-09T14:38:49.336769+00:00</updated><author><name>Antoine Dara</name></author><author><name>Bourema Kouriba</name></author><author><name>Amadou Daou</name></author><author><name>Abdoul Karim Sangare</name></author><author><name>Djibril Kassogue</name></author><author><name>Charles Dara</name></author><author><name>Abdoulaye Djimde</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Next generation sequencing (NGS) has become a necessary tool for genomic epidemiology. Even though the utility of genomics in human health has been proved, the genomic surveillance has never been so important until the COVID 19 pandemic. This has been evidenced with the detection of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil recently using genomic surveillance. Until recently, Malian scientists did not have access to any local NGS platform and samples had to be shipped abroad for sequencing. Here, we report on how we adapted a laboratory setup for Plasmodium research to generate the first complete SARS-CoV-2 genome locally. Total RNA underwent a library preparation using an Illumina TruSeq stranded RNA kit. A metagenomics sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform following by bioinformatic analyses on a local server in Mali. We recovered a full genome of SARS-CoV-2 of 29 kb with an average depth coverage of 200x. We have demonstrated our capability of generating a high quality genome with limited resources and highlight the need to develop genomics capacity locally to solve health problems. We discuss challenges related to access to reagents during a pandemic period and propose some home-made solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><published>2021-05-05T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.28.21256237</id><title>Cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in low- and middle-income countries (15 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-09T14:38:49.336435+00:00</updated><author><name>Mark J.

In response, multinational partners have proposed programs to allocate vaccines to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. Yet, there remains a substantial funding gap for such programs&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. Further, the optimal vaccine supply is unknown and the cost-effectiveness of investments into global vaccination programs has not been described. We used a validated COVID-19 simulation model&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; to project the health benefits and costs of reaching 20%-70% vaccine coverage in 91 LMICs. We show that funding 20% vaccine coverage over one year among 91 LMICs would prevent 294 million infections and 2 million deaths, with 26 million years of life saved at a cost of US$6.4 billion, for an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$250/year of life saved (YLS). Increasing vaccine coverage up to 50% would prevent millions more infections and save hundreds of thousands of additional lives, with ICERs below US$8,000/YLS. Results were robust to variations in vaccine efficacy and hesitancy, but were more sensitive to assumptions about epidemic pace and vaccination costs. These results support efforts to fund vaccination programs in LMICs and complement arguments about health equity&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, economic benefits&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, and pandemic control&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><published>2021-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.05.21256257</id><title>A Rapid and Reliable Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry Method for SARS-CoV-2 Diagnostics from Gargle Solutions and Saliva (16 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-09T14:38:49.336167+00:00</updated><author><name>Marc Kipping</name></author><author><name>Dirk Taenzler</name></author><author><name>Andrea Sinz</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;We describe a rapid liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method for the direct detection and quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein in gargle solutions and saliva.

Interactions between clients and care workers are modelled using specially generated networks, with network parameters reflecting realistic patterns of care needs and visit allocation. These networks are then used to simulate and SEIR-type epidemic dynamics with different numbers of infectious and recovery stages. The results indicate that with the same overall capacity provided by care workers, the minimum peak proportion of infection, and the smallest overall size of infection are achieved for the highest proportion of overlap between visit allocation, i.e. when care workers have the highest chances of being allocated a visit to the same client they have visited before. An intuitive explanation of this is that while providing the required care coverage, maximising overlap in visit allocation reduces the possibility of an infectious care worker inadvertently spreading the infection to other clients. The model is quite generic and can be adapted to any particular directly transmitted infectious disease, such as, more recently, COVID-19, provided accurate estimates of disease parameters can be obtained from real data.&lt;/p&gt;</content><published>2021-05-07T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.05.442780</id><title>Prior aerosol infection with lineage A SARS-CoV-2 variant protects hamsters from disease, but not reinfection with B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variant (16 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-09T14:38:49.335423+00:00</updated><author><name>Claude Kwe Yinda</name></author><author><name>Julia R.

Munster</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs). It is currently unclear whether previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 provides protection against reinfection with VOCs. Here, we show that low dose aerosol exposure to hCoV-19/human/USA/WA-CDC-WA1/2020 (WA1, lineage A), resulted in a productive mild infection. In contrast, low dose of SARS-CoV-2 via fomites did not result in productive infection in the majority of exposed hamsters and these animals remained non-seroconverted. After recovery, hamsters were re-exposed to hCoV-19/South African/KRISP-K005325/2020 (VOC B.1.351) via an intranasal challenge. Seroconverted rechallenged animals did not lose weight and shed virus for 3 days. They had little infectious virus and no pathology in the lungs. In contrast, shedding, weight loss and extensive pulmonary pathology caused by B.1.351 replication was observed in the non-seroconverted animals. The rechallenged seroconverted animals did not transmit virus to naïve sentinels via direct contact transmission, in contrast to the non-seroconverted animals. Reinfection with B.1.351 triggered an anamnestic response that boosted not only neutralizing titers against lineage A, but also titers against B.1.351. Our results confirm that aerosol exposure is a more efficient infection route than fomite exposure. Furthermore, initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 lineage A does not prevent heterologous reinfection with B.1.351 but prevents disease and onward transmission. These data suggest that previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure induces partial protective immunity. The reinfection generated a broadly neutralizing humoral response capable of effectively neutralizing B.1.351 while maintaining its ability to neutralize the virus to which the initial response was directed against.&lt;/p&gt;</content><published>2021-05-05T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.28.21256261</id><title>Aspirin and NSAID use and the risk of COVID-19 (21 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-09T14:38:49.334832+00:00</updated><author><name>David A.

Users of the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application reported use of aspirin and other NSAIDs between March 24 and May 8, 2020. Users were queried daily about symptoms, COVID-19 testing, and healthcare seeking behavior. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine the risk of COVID-19 among according to aspirin or non-aspirin NSAID users. Among 2,736,091 individuals in the U.S., U.K., and Sweden, we documented 8,966 incident reports of a positive COVID-19 test over 60,817,043 person-days of follow-up. Compared to non-users and after stratifying by age, sex, country, day of study entry, and race/ethnicity, non-aspirin NSAID use was associated with a modest risk for testing COVID-19 positive (HR 1.23 [1.09, 1.32]), but no significant association was observed among aspirin users (HR 1.13 [0.92, 1.38]). After adjustment for lifestyle factors, comorbidities and baseline symptoms, any NSAID use was not associated with risk (HR 1.02 [0.94, 1.10]). Results were similar for those seeking healthcare for COVID-19 and were not substantially different according to lifestyle and sociodemographic factors or after accounting for propensity to receive testing. Our results do not support an association of NSAID use, including aspirin, with COVID-19 infection. Previous reports of a potential association may be due to higher rates of comorbidities or use of NSAIDs to treat symptoms associated with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;One Sentence Summary&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;NSAID use is not associated with COVID-19 risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><published>2021-05-02T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.06.442916</id><title>Identification of DAXX As A Restriction Factor Of SARS-CoV-2 Through A CRISPR/Cas9 Screen (45 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-09T14:38:49.334220+00:00</updated><author><name>Alice Mac Kain</name></author><author><name>Ghizlane Maarifi</name></author><author><name>Sophie-Marie Aicher</name></author><author><name>Nathalie Arhel</name></author><author><name>Artem Baidaliuk</name></author><author><name>Thomas Vallet</name></author><author><name>Quang Dinh Tran</name></author><author><name>Alexandra Hardy</name></author><author><name>Maxime Chazal</name></author><author><name>Françoise Porrot</name></author><author><name>Molly OhAinle</name></author><author><name>Jared Carlson-Stevermer</name></author><author><name>Jennifer Oki</name></author><author><name>Kevin Holden</name></author><author><name>Etienne Simon-Lorière</name></author><author><name>Timothée Bruel</name></author><author><name>Olivier Schwartz</name></author><author><name>Nolwenn Jouvenet</name></author><author><name>Sébastien Nisole</name></author><author><name>Marco Vignuzzi</name></author><author><name>Ferdinand Roesch</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;While interferon restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture, only a handful of Interferon Stimulated Genes with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 have been identified. Here, we describe a functional CRISPR/Cas9 screen aiming at identifying SARS-CoV-2 restriction factors. We identified DAXX, a scaffold protein residing in PML nuclear bodies known to limit the replication of DNA viruses and retroviruses, as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. Basal expression of DAXX was sufficient to limit the replication of the virus, and DAXX over-expression further restricted infection. In contrast with most of its previously described antiviral activities, DAXX-mediated restriction of SARS-CoV-2 was independent of the SUMOylation pathway. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered the re-localization of DAXX to cytoplasmic sites of viral replication and led to its degradation. Together, these results demonstrate that DAXX is a potent restriction factor for SARS-CoV-2 and that the virus has evolved a mechanism to counteract its action.&lt;/p&gt;</content><published>2021-05-06T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.06.21256403</id><title>Detection of persistent SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in oral mucosal fluid and upper respiratory tract specimens following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination (1607 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-09T14:38:49.333588+00:00</updated><author><name>Aubree Mades</name></author><author><name>Prithivi Chellamuthu</name></author><author><name>Lauren Lopez</name></author><author><name>Noah Kojima</name></author><author><name>Melanie A MacMullan</name></author><author><name>Nicholas Denny</name></author><author><name>Aaron N Angel</name></author><author><name>Joseph Casian</name></author><author><name>Matthew Brobeck</name></author><author><name>Nina Nirema</name></author><author><name>Jeffrey D Klausner</name></author><author><name>Frederick E Turner</name></author><author><name>Vladimir I Slepnev</name></author><author><name>Albina Ibrayeva</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing SAR-CoV-2 infection by generating an immune response, which in part produces SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in serum. In this study, we hypothesized that COVID-19 vaccines may elicit production of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the upper respiratory tract, such as in oral and nasal mucosal fluid. To test that hypothesis, we enrolled 114 participants within 3-7 days of receiving the first dose of the Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and collected oral mucosal fluid samples on days 5, 10, 15, and 20 after each vaccine dose. Of participants naive to SARS-CoV-2 (n = 89), 79 (85.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by time point 2 (10 days +/-2 days after first vaccine dose), and 100% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG by time point 3 (15 days +/- 2 days after first vaccine dose). Additionally, we collected paired oral mucosal fluid and anterior nares samples from 10 participants who had received both vaccine doses. We found that participants had an average SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody concentration of 2496.0 +/- 2698.0ng/mL in nasal mucosal fluid versus 153.4 +/- 141.0ng/mL in oral mucosal fluid. Here, we demonstrate detection and longitudinal persistence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in upper respiratory tract specimens following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. A high concentration of IgG targeting viral spike protein in the upper respiratory system may play an unexplored role in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and deserves further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><published>2021-05-07T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry></feed>
