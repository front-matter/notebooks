Among a clinical laboratory that has been conducting routine workforce screening since the beginning of the pandemic, we aimed to assess the relative risk of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among individuals who were SARS-CoV-2 naïve, previously infected, or vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an electronic laboratory information system, employees were divided into three groups: (1) SARS-CoV-2 naïve and unvaccinated, (2) previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and (3) vaccinated. Person-days were measured from the date of the employee first test and truncated at the end of the observation period. SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as two positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in a 30-day period. Individuals with fewer than 14 days of follow up were excluded. Incidence estimates and the 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the Poisson Exact equation. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) was used as a measure of association between groups. Analyses were performed on StataSE (StataCorp, College Station, TX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified 4313, 254 and 739 employee records for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The median age of employees was 29.0 years (interquartile range: 23.6, 39.9). During the observation period, 254, 0, and 4 infections were identified among groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Group 1 had an incidence of 25.9 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 22.8-29.3). Group 2 had an incidence of 0 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0-5.0). Group 3 had an incidence of 1.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.04-4.2). The IRR of reinfection among those with previous infection compared to SARS-CoV-2 naïve was 0 (95% CI: 0-0.19). The IRR of those vaccinated compared to SARS-CoV-2 naïve was 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02-0.16). The IRR of those vaccinated compared to prior SARS-CoV-2 was 0 (95% CI: 0-4.98).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 were associated with decreased risk for infection or re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in a routinely screened workforce. The was no difference in the infection incidence between vaccinated individuals and individuals with previous infection. Further research is needed to determine whether our results are consistent with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.03.21259976" rel="alternate" title="Incidence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 infection among previously infected or vaccinated employees (246 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.08.21259351</id><title>Heparin for Moderately Ill Patients with Covid-19 (212 tweets)</title><updated>2021-07-12T06:55:39.712121+00:00</updated><author><name>Michelle Sholzberg</name></author><author><name>Grace H.

Early initiation of therapeutic heparin could decrease the thrombo-inflammatory process, and reduce the risk of critical illness or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We randomly assigned moderately ill hospitalized ward patients admitted for Covid-19 with elevated D-dimer level to therapeutic or prophylactic heparin. The primary outcome was a composite of death, invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation or ICU admission. Safety outcomes included major bleeding. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 28 days, the primary composite outcome occurred in 37 of 228 patients (16.2%) assigned to therapeutic heparin, and 52 of 237 patients (21.9%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 1.10; p=0.12). Four patients (1.8%) assigned to therapeutic heparin died compared with 18 patients (7.6%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (odds ratio, 0.22; 95%-CI, 0.07 to 0.65). The composite of all-cause mortality or any mechanical ventilation occurred in 23 (10.1%) in the therapeutic heparin group and 38 (16.0%) in the prophylactic heparin group (odds ratio, 0.59; 95%-CI, 0.34 to 1.02). Major bleeding occurred in 2 patients (0.9%) with therapeutic heparin and 4 patients (1.7%) with prophylactic heparin (odds ratio, 0.52; 95%-CI, 0.09 to 2.85).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;In moderately ill ward patients with Covid-19 and elevated D-dimer level, therapeutic heparin did not significantly reduce the primary outcome but decreased the odds of death at 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trial registration numbers: &lt;ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="clintrialgov" xlink:href="NCT04362085"&gt;NCT04362085&lt;/ext-link&gt;;  &lt;ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="clintrialgov" xlink:href="NCT04444700"&gt;NCT04444700&lt;/ext-link&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.08.21259351" rel="alternate" title="Heparin for Moderately Ill Patients with Covid-19 (212 tweets)"/><category term="Hematology"/><published>2021-07-08T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.03.21259949</id><title>Preserved C-reactive protein responses to blood stream infections following tocilizumab treatment for COVID-19 (34 tweets)</title><updated>2021-07-12T06:55:39.713608+00:00</updated><author><name>Emmanuel Q Wey</name></author><author><name>Clare Bristow</name></author><author><name>Aarti Nandani</name></author><author><name>Bryan O’Farrell</name></author><author><name>Jay Pang</name></author><author><name>Marisa Lanzman</name></author><author><name>Shuang Yang</name></author><author><name>Soo Ho</name></author><author><name>Damien Mack</name></author><author><name>Michael Spiro</name></author><author><name>Indran Balakrishnan</name></author><author><name>Sanjay Bhagani</name></author><author><name>Gabriele Pollara</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are elevated following bacterial infections but may be attenuated by the IL-6-receptor antagonist tocilizumab.

We analyzed 684 genomes from samples collected across six counties in coastal Kenya during the first two waves (March 2020 -February 2021). Up to 32 Pango lineages were detected in the local sample with six accounting for 88.0% of the sequenced infections: B.1 (60.4%), B.1.1 (8.9%), B.1.549 (7.9%), B.1.530 (6.4%), N.8 (4.4%) and A (3.1%). In a contemporaneous global sample, 571 lineages were identified, 247 for Africa and 88 for East Africa. We detected 262 location transition events comprising: 64 viral imports into Coastal Kenya; 26 viral exports from coastal Kenya; and 172 inter-county import/export events. Most international viral imports (61%) and exports (88%) occurred through Mombasa, a key coastal touristic and commercial center; and many occurred prior to June 2020, when stringent local COVID-19 restriction measures were enforced. After this period, local transmission dominated, and distinct local phylogenies were seen. Our analysis supports moving control strategies from a focus on international travel to local transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.01.21259583" rel="alternate" title="Genomic surveillance reveals the spread patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in coastal Kenya during the first two waves (26 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.07.451375</id><title>Multivalent designed proteins protect against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (14 tweets)</title><updated>2021-07-12T06:55:39.715506+00:00</updated><author><name>Andrew C.

To address this challenge, we developed multivalent protein-based minibinders as potential prophylactic and therapeutic agents. Homotrimers of single minibinders and fusions of three distinct minibinders were designed to geometrically match the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer architecture and were optimized by cell-free expression and found to exhibit virtually no measurable dissociation upon binding. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) showed that these trivalent minibinders engage all three receptor binding domains on a single S trimer. The top candidates neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values in the low pM range, resist viral escape, and provide protection in highly vulnerable human ACE2-expressing transgenic mice, both prophylactically and therapeutically. Our integrated workflow promises to accelerate the design of mutationally resilient therapeutics for pandemic preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;One-Sentence Summary&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We designed, developed, and characterized potent, trivalent miniprotein binders that provide prophylactic and therapeutic protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.07.451375" rel="alternate" title="Multivalent designed proteins protect against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (14 tweets)"/><category term="Synthetic Biology"/><published>2021-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.04.21259945</id><title>SARS-CoV-2 environmental contamination from hospitalised COVID-19 patients receiving aerosol generating procedures (12 tweets)</title><updated>2021-07-12T06:55:39.717665+00:00</updated><author><name>RL Winslow</name></author><author><name>J Zhou</name></author><author><name>EF Windle</name></author><author><name>I Nur</name></author><author><name>R Lall</name></author><author><name>C Ji</name></author><author><name>JE Millar</name></author><author><name>P Dark</name></author><author><name>J Naisbitt</name></author><author><name>A Simonds</name></author><author><name>J Dunning</name></author><author><name>W Barclay</name></author><author><name>K Baillie</name></author><author><name>GD Perkins</name></author><author><name>MG Semple</name></author><author><name>DF McAuley</name></author><author><name>CA Green</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) and high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) are considered ‘aerosol-generating procedures’ (AGPs) in the treatment of COVID-19. We aimed to measure air and surface environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 virus when CPAP and HFNO were used, compared with supplemental oxygen, to investigate the potential risks of viral transmission to healthcare workers and patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;30 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen, with a fraction of inspired oxygen ≥0.4 to maintain oxygen saturations ≥94%, were prospectively enrolled into an observational environmental sampling study. Participants received either supplemental oxygen, CPAP or HFNO (n=10 in each group). A nasopharyngeal swab, three air and three surface samples were collected from each participant and the clinical environment. RT qPCR analyses were performed for viral and human RNA, and positive/suspected-positive samples were cultured for the presence of biologically viable virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall 21/30 (70%) of participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharynx. In contrast, only 4/90 (4%) and 6/90 (7%) of all air and surface samples tested positive (positive for E and ORF1a) for viral RNA respectively, although there were an additional 10 suspected-positive samples in both air and surfaces samples (positive for E or ORF1a).

There has been limited research on the impact of anticoagulant and antiplatelet choice in COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a single-centre retrospective cohort study of 933 patients with COVID-19 infection presenting between 01/02/2020 and 31/05/2020. Survival time at 90 days post-diagnosis and thromboembolism development were the measured outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 933 total patients, mean age was 68 years and 54.4% were male. 297 (31.8%) did not survive at 90 days. A Cox proportional hazards model analysis found no statistically significant relationship between anticoagulant or antiplatelet choice and survival (p&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;57 (6.3%) developed thromboembolism. Antiplatelet choice was not shown to have a statistically significant relationship with thromboembolism development. Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use did not have a statistically significant impact on thromboembolism development (p&amp;lt;0.05). Therapeutic low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) use was associated with increased thromboembolism risk (Odds ratio = 14.327, 95% CI 1.904 – 107.811, p = 0.010).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antiplatelet choice was shown to have no impact on survival or thromboembolism development in COVID-19. Anticoagulant choice did not impact survival or thromboembolism development, aside from LMWH. Therapeutic LMWH use was associated with increased risk of thromboembolism. However, it should be noted that the sample size for patients using therapeutic LMWH was small (n=4), and there may be confounding variables affecting both LMWH use and thromboembolism development. These findings should be repeated with a larger sample of patients using therapeutic LMWH with additional adjustment for cofounding variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.03.21254541" rel="alternate" title="Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets in COVID-19: Impact on Survival and Thromboembolism Development (7 tweets)"/><category term="Cardiovascular Medicine"/><published>2021-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.06.21259528</id><title>Pre-vaccination and early B cell signatures predict antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (7 tweets)</title><updated>2021-07-12T06:55:39.719091+00:00</updated><author><name>Lela Kardava</name></author><author><name>Nicholas Rachmaninoff</name></author><author><name>William W.

Here we longitudinally dissected antibody, plasmablast, and memory B cell (MBC) responses to the two-dose Moderna mRNA vaccine in SARS-CoV-2-uninfected adults. Robust, coordinated IgA and IgG antibody responses were preceded by bursts of spike-specific plasmablasts after both doses, but earlier and more intensely after dose two. Distinct antigen-specific MBC populations also emerged post-vaccination with varying kinetics. We identified antigen non-specific pre-vaccination MBC and post-vaccination plasmablasts after dose one and their spike-specific counterparts early after dose two that correlated with subsequent antibody levels. These baseline and response signatures can thus provide early indicators of serological efficacy and explain response variability in the population.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.06.21259528" rel="alternate" title="Pre-vaccination and early B cell signatures predict antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (7 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.01.21259852</id><title>Efficacy of remdesivir-containing therapy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a prospective clinical experience (6 tweets)</title><updated>2021-07-12T06:55:39.719767+00:00</updated><author><name>Alessandro Russo</name></author><author><name>Erica Binetti</name></author><author><name>Cristian Borrazzo</name></author><author><name>Elio Gentilini Cacciola</name></author><author><name>Luigi Battistini</name></author><author><name>Giancarlo Ceccarelli</name></author><author><name>Claudio Maria Mastroianni</name></author><author><name>Gabriella d’Ettorre</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Objectives&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;remdesivir is currently approved for the treatment of COVID-19. The recommendation for using remdesivir in COVID-19 was based on the &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt; and &lt;italic&gt;in vivo&lt;/italic&gt; activity of this drug against SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;this was a prospective, observational study conducted on a large population of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the impact of remdesivir-containing therapy on 30-day mortality; secondary endpoint was the impact of remdesivir-containing therapy on the need of high flow oxygen therapy (HFNC) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or mechanical ventilation. Data were analyzed after propensity score matching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;407 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were consecutively enrolled. Out of these, 294 (72.2%) and 113 (27.8%) were respectively treated or not with remdesivir. Overall, 61 (14.9%) patients were treated during hospitalization with non-invasive or mechanical ventilation, while a 30-day mortality was observed in 21 (5.2%) patients with a global in-hospital mortality of 11%. Cox regression analysis, after propensity score matching, showed that therapies, including remdesivir-containing therapy, were not statistically associated with 30-day survival or mortality, while need of HFNC/NIV (HR 17.921, CI95% 0.954-336.73, p=0.044) and mechanical ventilation (HR 3.9, CI95% 5.36-16.2, p=0.003) resulted independently associated with 30-day mortality. Finally, therapies including or not remdesivir were not independently associated with a lower or higher risk of HFNC/NIV or mechanical ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;this real-life experience about the remdesivir use in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was not associated with significant increase in rates of survival or reduced use of HFNC/NIV or mechanical ventilation, compared to patients treated with other therapies not including remdesivir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.01.21259852" rel="alternate" title="Efficacy of remdesivir-containing therapy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: a prospective clinical experience (6 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.30.21259758</id><title>Impact of regional heterogeneity on the severity of COVID-19 (6 tweets)</title><updated>2021-07-12T06:55:39.720219+00:00</updated><author><name>Shinya Tsuzuki</name></author><author><name>Yusuke Asai</name></author><author><name>Nobuaki Matsunaga</name></author><author><name>Haruhiko Ishioka</name></author><author><name>Takayuki Akiyama</name></author><author><name>Norio Ohmagari</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aimed to assess the impact of regional heterogeneity on the severity of COVID-19 in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We included 27,865 cases registered between January 2020 and February 2021 in the COVID-19 Registry of Japan to examine the relationship between the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) of COVID-19 patients on the day of admission and the prefecture where the patients live. A hierarchical Bayesian model was used to examine the random effect of each prefecture in addition to the patients’ backgrounds. In addition, we compared the results of two models; one model included the number of beds secured for COVID-19 patients in each prefecture as one of the fixed effects, and the other model did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicated that the prefecture had a substantial impact on the severity of COVID-19 on admission. Even when considering the effect of the number of beds separately, the heterogeneity caused by the random effect of each prefecture affected the severity of the case on admission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our analysis revealed a possible association between regional heterogeneity and increased/decreased risk of severe COVID-19 infection on admission.

Following the near-absence of historical examples of the long-time evolution of infectious diseases under similar circumstances, models are crucial to exemplify possible scenarios. Accordingly, in the present work we systematically generalize the popular susceptible-infectedrecovered model to account for mutations leading to repeatedly occurring new strains, which we coarse grain based on tools from statistical mechanics to derive a model predicting the most likely outcomes. The model predicts that mutations can induce a super-exponential growth of infection numbers at early times, which can self-amplify to giant infection waves which are caused by a positive feedback loop between infection numbers and mutations and lead to a simultaneous infection of the majority of the population. At later stages – if vaccination progresses too slowly – mutations can interrupt an ongoing decrease of infection numbers and can cause infection revivals which can occur as single waves or even as whole wave trains featuring alternative periods of decreasing and increasing infection numbers. Our results might be useful for discussions regarding the importance of a release of vaccine-patents to reduce the risk of mutation-induced infection revivals but also to coordinate the release of measures following a downwards trend of infection numbers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.06.21260067" rel="alternate" title="Mutation induced infection waves in diseases like COVID-19 (5 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry></feed>
