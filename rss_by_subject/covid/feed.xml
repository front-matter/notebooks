Clinical codes to describe this phenomenon were released in November 2020 in the UK, but it is not known how these codes have been used in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working on behalf of NHS England, we used OpenSAFELY data encompassing 96% of the English population. We measured the proportion of people with a recorded code for long COVID, overall and by demographic factors, electronic health record software system, and week. We also measured variation in recording amongst practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long COVID was recorded for 23,273 people. Coding was unevenly distributed amongst practices, with 26.7% of practices having not used the codes at all. Regional variation was high, ranging between 20.3 per 100,000 people for East of England (95% confidence interval 19.3-21.4) and 55.6 in London (95% CI 54.1-57.1). The rate was higher amongst women (52.1, 95% CI 51.3-52.9) compared to men (28.1, 95% CI 27.5-28.7), and higher amongst practices using EMIS software (53.7, 95% CI 52.9-54.4) compared to TPP software (20.9, 95% CI 20.3-21.4).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long COVID coding in primary care is low compared with early reports of long COVID prevalence. This may reflect under-coding, sub-optimal communication of clinical terms, under-diagnosis, a true low prevalence of long COVID diagnosed by clinicians, or a combination of factors. We recommend increased awareness of diagnostic codes, to facilitate research and planning of services; and surveys of clinicians’ experiences, to complement ongoing patient surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.06.21256755" rel="alternate" title="Clinical coding of long COVID in English primary care: a federated analysis of 58 million patient records in situ using OpenSAFELY (353 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-05-13T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.21256578</id><title>Live virus neutralisation testing in convalescent patients and subjects vaccinated against 19A, 20B, 20I/501Y.V1 and 20H/501Y.V2 isolates of SARS-CoV-2 (306 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.446784+00:00</updated><author><name>Claudia Gonzalez</name></author><author><name>Carla Saade</name></author><author><name>Antonin Bal</name></author><author><name>Martine Valette</name></author><author><name>Kahina Saker</name></author><author><name>Bruno Lina</name></author><author><name>Laurence Josset</name></author><author><name>Mary-Anne Trabaud</name></author><author><name>Guillaume Thiery</name></author><author><name>Elisabeth Botelho-Nevers</name></author><author><name>Stéphane Paul</name></author><author><name>Paul Verhoeven</name></author><author><name>Thomas Bourlet</name></author><author><name>Sylvie Pillet</name></author><author><name>Florence Morfin</name></author><author><name>Sophie Trouillet-Assant</name></author><author><name>Bruno Pozzetto</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 mutations appeared recently and can lead to conformational changes in the spike protein and probably induce modifications in antigenicity. In this study, we wanted to assess the neutralizing capacity of antibodies to prevent cell infection, using a live virus neutralisation test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sera samples were collected from different populations: two-dose vaccinated COVID-19-naïve healthcare workers (HCWs; Pfizer-BioNTech BNT161b2), 6-months post mild COVID-19 HCWs, and critical COVID-19 patients. We tested various clades such as 19A (initial one), 20B (B.1.1.241 lineage), 20I/501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7 lineage), and 20H/501Y.V2 (B.1.351 lineage).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;No significant difference was observed between the 20B and 19A isolates for HCWs with mild COVID-19 and critical patients. However, a significant decrease in neutralisation ability was found for 20I/501Y.V1 in comparison with 19A isolate for critical patients and HCWs 6-months post infection. Concerning 20H/501Y.V2, all populations had a significant reduction in neutralising antibody titres in comparison with the 19A isolate. Interestingly, a significant difference in neutralisation capacity was observed for vaccinated HCWs between the two variants whereas it was not significant for the convalescent groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neutralisation capacity was slightly reduced for critical patients and HCWs 6-months post infection. No neutralisation escape could be feared concerning the two variants of concern in both populations. The reduced neutralising response observed towards the 20H/501Y.V2 in comparison with the 19A and 20I/501Y.V1 isolates in fully immunized subjects with the BNT162b2 vaccine is a striking finding of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.21256578" rel="alternate" title="Live virus neutralisation testing in convalescent patients and subjects vaccinated against 19A, 20B, 20I/501Y.V1 and 20H/501Y.V2 isolates of SARS-CoV-2 (306 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.12.21257080</id><title>A year of genomic surveillance reveals how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic unfolded in Africa (273 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.447506+00:00</updated><author><name>Eduan Wilkinson</name></author><author><name>Marta Giovanetti</name></author><author><name>Houriiyah Tegally</name></author><author><name>James E.

Here, we describe the genomic epidemiology using a dataset of 8746 genomes from 33 African countries and two overseas territories. We show that the epidemics in most countries were initiated by importations, predominantly from Europe, which diminished following the early introduction of international travel restrictions. As the pandemic progressed, ongoing transmission in many countries and increasing mobility led to the emergence and spread within the continent of many variants of concern and interest, such as B.1.351, B.1.525, A.23.1 and C.1.1. Although distorted by low sampling numbers and blind-spots, the findings highlight that Africa must not be left behind in the global pandemic response, otherwise it could become a breeding ground for new variants.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.12.21257080" rel="alternate" title="A year of genomic surveillance reveals how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic unfolded in Africa (273 tweets)"/><category term="Genetic and Genomic Medicine"/><published>2021-05-13T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.21257037</id><title>Mental health of Adolescents in the Pandemic: Long-COVID19 or Long-Pandemic Syndrome?

To better understand the symptoms of long-COVID19 in adolescents and to distinguish infection-associated symptoms from pandemic-associated symptoms, we conducted a Long-COVID19 survey, comparing responses from seropositive and seronegative adolescents. To our knowledge, data of Long-COVID19 surveys with seronegative control groups have not been published yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since May 2020 students grade 8-12 in fourteen secondary schools in Eastern Saxony were enrolled in the SchoolCovid19 study. Seroprevalence was assessed via serial SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in all participants. Furthermore, during the March/April 2021 study visit all participants were asked to complete a 12 question Long-COVID19 survey regarding the occurrence and frequency of difficulties concentrating, memory loss, listlessness, headache, abdominal pain, myalgia/ arthralgia, fatigue, insomnia and mood (sadness, anger, happiness and tenseness).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Findings&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;1560 students with a median age of 15 years participated in this study. 1365 (88%) were seronegative, 188 (12%) were seropositive. Each symptom was present in at least 35% of the students within the last seven days before the survey. However, there was no statistical difference comparing the reported symptoms between seropositive students and seronegative students. Whether the infection was known or unknown to the participant did not influence the prevalence of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Interpretation&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of differences comparing the reported symptoms between seropositive and seronegative students suggests that Long-COVID19 might be less common than previously thought and emphasizing the impact of pandemic-associated symptoms regarding the well-being and mental health of young adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Funding&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was supported by a grant by the Federal State of Saxony.

Data on immune responses following a single-dose adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) in individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection are however limited, and current guidelines recommend a two-dose regime regardless of preexisting immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We compared spike-specific IgG and pseudo-neutralizing spike-ACE2 blocking antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 wild type and variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P1 following two doses of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 and a single dose of the adenovector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in 232 healthcare workers with and without previous COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Findings&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post-vaccine levels of spike-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 wild type and all three variants of concern were similar or higher in participants receiving a single dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine post SARS-CoV-2 infection (both &amp;lt; 11 months post infection (n=37) and ≥ 11 months infection (n=46)) compared to participants who received two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine (n=149).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Interpretation&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data support that a single dose ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine serves as an effective immune booster after priming with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection up to at least 11 months post infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.08.21256866" rel="alternate" title="Antibody Responses After a Single Dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccine in Healthcare Workers Previously Infected with SARS-CoV-2 (163 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.14.444076</id><title>The Spike Proteins of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 and B.1.618 Variants Identified in India Provide Partial Resistance to Vaccine-elicited and Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies.

B.1.617 encodes a spike protein with mutations L452R, E484Q, D614G and P681R while the B.1.618 spike has mutations Δ145-146, E484K and D614G. We generated lentiviruses pseudotyped by the variant proteins and determined their resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera, vaccine-elicited antibodies and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Viruses with B.1.617 and B.1.618 spike were neutralized with a 2-5-fold decrease in titer by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies. The E484Q and E484K versions were neutralized with a 2-4-fold decrease in titer. Virus with the B.1.617 spike protein was neutralized with a 4.7-fold decrease in titer by the Regeneron monoclonal antibody cocktail as a result of the L452R mutation. The modest neutralization resistance of the variant spike proteins to vaccine elicited antibody suggests that current vaccines will remain protective against the B.1.617 and B.1.618 variants.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.14.444076" rel="alternate" title="The Spike Proteins of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 and B.1.618 Variants Identified in India Provide Partial Resistance to Vaccine-elicited and Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies.

To advance this, we present a comprehensive multi-omic blood atlas in patients with varying COVID-19 severity and compare with influenza, sepsis and healthy volunteers. We identify immune signatures and correlates of host response. Hallmarks of disease severity revealed cells, their inflammatory mediators and networks as potential therapeutic targets, including progenitor cells and specific myeloid and lymphocyte subsets, features of the immune repertoire, acute phase response, metabolism and coagulation. Persisting immune activation involving AP-1/p38MAPK was a specific feature of COVID-19. The plasma proteome enabled sub-phenotyping into patient clusters, predictive of severity and outcome. Tensor and matrix decomposition of the overall dataset revealed feature groupings linked with disease severity and specificity. Our systems-based integrative approach and blood atlas will inform future drug development, clinical trial design and personalised medicine approaches for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.21256877" rel="alternate" title="A blood atlas of COVID-19 defines hallmarks of disease severity and specificity (113 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.08.21256868</id><title>Monitors to Improve Indoor Carbon Dioxide Concentrations in the Hospital: Background, Rationale and Protocol for a Randomized, Sham-controlled, Cross-Over, Open Label Trial (61 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.484732+00:00</updated><author><name>Michaël R. Laurent</name></author><author><name>Johan Frans</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused considerably morbidity and mortality worldwide, mainly among older adults. Hospital outbreaks contribute to the burden of this disease, despite optimal hand hygiene and personal protective equipment such as masks and face shields. Ventilation with fresh outdoor air has emerged as an important strategy to reduce indoor aerosol transmission of COVID-19. Carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) monitors are increasingly advocated to facilitate ventilation in schools, long-term care facilities, offices and public buildings. Moreover, several health authorities have issued guidelines for target CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; values in work as well as clinical environments. Given that modern hospitals have superior indoor air quality control systems, it remains however unknown whether feedback from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monitors is needed and/or effective to improve ventilation further. Here, we describe the rationale and protocol for a randomized, sham-controlled, crossover, open label trial of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monitors in double-bed hospital rooms in two acute geriatric wards. Based on pilot data, Aranet4 Home&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; monitors will be used to alert nurses and other staff to raised indoor CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations. Practical limitations in implementing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monitors are discussed, and will be surveyed among staff as additional study outcomes. The Monitors to Improve Indoor Carbon Dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Concentrations in the Hospital (MICH) trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: &lt;underline&gt;NCT04770597&lt;/underline&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.08.21256868" rel="alternate" title="Monitors to Improve Indoor Carbon Dioxide Concentrations in the Hospital: Background, Rationale and Protocol for a Randomized, Sham-controlled, Cross-Over, Open Label Trial (61 tweets)"/><category term="Health Systems and Quality Improvement"/><published>2021-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.21256876</id><title>The Impact of Control and Mitigation Strategies during the Second Wave of COVID-19 Infections in Spain and Italy (44 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.485047+00:00</updated><author><name>Marco De Nadai</name></author><author><name>Kristof Roomp</name></author><author><name>Bruno Lepri</name></author><author><name>Nuria Oliver</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;European countries struggled to fight against the second and the third waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the Test-Trace-Isolate (TTI) strategy widely adopted over the summer and early fall failed to effectively contain the spread of the disease. In this paper, we shed light on the effectiveness of such a strategy in two European countries (Spain and Italy) by analysing data from June to December 2020, collected via a large-scale online citizen survey with 95,251 answers in Spain and 43,393 answers in Italy. Through our analysis, we identify several weaknesses in each of the three pillars of the TTI strategy: testing, tracing and isolating. Moreover, we analyse the respondents’ self-reported behaviour before and after the mitigation strategies were deployed during the second wave of infections. We find that the changes in the participants’ behaviour were more pronounced in Italy than in Spain, whereas in both countries, respondents reported being very compliant with individual protection measures, such as wearing facial masks or frequently disinfecting their hands. Finally, we analyse the participants’ perceptions about their government’s measures and the safety of everyday activities and places regarding the risk of getting an infection. We find that the perceived risk is often gender- and age-dependent and not aligned with the risk level identified by the literature. This finding emphasises the importance of deploying public-health communication campaigns to debunk misconceptions about SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our work shows the value of online citizen surveys to quickly and cheaply collect large-scale data to support and evaluate policy decisions to contrast the spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.21256876" rel="alternate" title="The Impact of Control and Mitigation Strategies during the Second Wave of COVID-19 Infections in Spain and Italy (44 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.05.21256710</id><title>Evolution of COVID-19 symptoms during the first 9 months after illness onset (39 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.485438+00:00</updated><author><name>Elke Wynberg</name></author><author><name>Hugo van Willigen</name></author><author><name>Maartje Dijkstra</name></author><author><name>Anders Boyd</name></author><author><name>Neeltje A.

We evaluated symptom onset, severity and recovery up to nine months after illness onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RECoVERED Study is a prospective cohort study based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Participants aged&amp;gt;18 years were recruited following SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis via the local Public Health Service and from hospitals. Standardised symptom questionnaires were completed at recruitment, at one week and month after recruitment, and monthly thereafter. Clinical severity was defined according to WHO criteria. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to compare time from illness onset to symptom recovery, by clinical severity. We examined determinants of time to recovery using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 11 May 2020 and 31 January 2021, 301 COVID-19 patients (167[55%] male) were recruited, of whom 99/301(32.9%) had mild, 140/301(46.5%) moderate, 30/301(10.0%) severe and 32/301(10.6%) critical disease. The proportion of symptomatic participants who reported at least one persistent symptom at 12 weeks after illness onset was greater in those with severe/critical disease (81.7%[95%CI=68.7-89.7%]) compared to those with mild or moderate disease (33.0%[95%CI=23.0-43.3%] and 63.8%[95%CI=54.8-71.5%]). Even at nine months after illness onset, almost half of all participants (42.1%[95%CI=35.6-48.5]) overall continued to report ≥1 symptom. Recovery was slower in participants with BMI≥30kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (HR 0.51[95%CI=0.30-0.87]) compared to those with BMI&amp;lt;25kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, after adjusting for age, sex and number of comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 symptoms persisted for nine months after illness onset, even in those with mild disease.

Unfortunately, the global vaccination is not efficient enough to attain a vaccine-based herd-immunity and yet no special and effective drug is developed to contain the spread of the disease. Previously we have identified CD147 as a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we demonstrated that CD147 antibody effectively inhibits infection and cytokine storm caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants. In CD147&lt;sup&gt;KO&lt;/sup&gt; VeroE6 cells, infections of SARS-CoV-2, its variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351) and pseudovirus mutants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.525, B.1.526 (S477N), B.1.526 (E484K), P.1, P.2, B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2) were decreased. Meanwhile, CD147 antibody effectively blocked the entry of variants and pseudomutants in VeroE6 cells, and inhibited the expression of cytokines. A model of SARS-CoV-2-infected hCD147 transgenic mice was constructed, which recapitulated the features of exudative diffuse alveolar damage and dynamic immune responses of COVID-19. CD147 antibody could effectively clear the virus and alveolar exudation, resolving the pneumonia. We found the elevated level of cyclophilin A (CyPA) in plasma of severe/critical cases, and identified CyPA as the most important proinflammatory intermediate causing cytokine storm. Mechanistically, spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 bound to CD147 and initiated the JAK-STAT pathway, which induced expression of CyPA. CyPA reciprocally bound to CD147, triggered MAPK pathway and consequently mediated the expression of cytokine and chemokine. In conclusion, CD147 is a critical target for SARS-CoV-2 variants and CD147 antibody is a promising drug to control the new wave of COVID-19 epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.14.444111" rel="alternate" title="CD147 antibody specifically and effectively inhibits infection and cytokine storm of SARS-CoV-2 variants (38 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.10.21256933</id><title>Fixed dosing of tocilizumab in ICU admitted COVID-19 patients is a superior choice compared to bodyweight based dosing; an observational population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study (30 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.486516+00:00</updated><author><name>Dirk Jan A.R.

The currently applied dosage of 8 mg/kg is based on use of this drug for other indications, however is has not formally been investigated for COVID-19. In this study pharmacokinetics and dynamics of tocilizumab were investigated in ICU admitted COVID-19 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was an open-label, single-center observational pharmacokinetic and -dynamic evaluation study. Enrolled patients, with polymerase chain reaction confirmed Covid-19 were admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation or high flow nasal canula oxygen support. All patients were 18 years of age or older and received tocilizumab within 24 hours after admission to the ICU and received 6 mg dexamethasone daily as concomitant therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;29 patients were enrolled between 15 December 2020 and 15 March 2021. A total of 139 tocilizumab plasma samples were obtained covering the pharmacokinetic curve of day 0 up to day 20 after tocilizumab initiation. A population pharmacokinetic model with parallel linear and non-linear clearance was developed and validated. Average AUC&lt;sub&gt;0-inf 1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;DOSE&lt;/sub&gt; was 938 [±190] ug/mL*days. Tocilizumab half-life was estimated to be 4·15 [±0·24] days. All patients had tocilizumab exposure above 1 ug/ml for at least 15 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides evidence to support a fixed dose of 600 mg tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore our findings suggest that alternative cost saving regimens with even lower doses are likely to be as effective as the current 8 mg/kg recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Funding&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;No external funding was received for this work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the randomized controlled trial REMAP-CAP, the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab was shown to improve outcome, including survival in ICU admitted COVID-19 patients. Because obesity is a risk factor for development of severe COVID-19, concerns have been raised about overtreatment as well as undertreatment through weight-based dosing of tocilizumab. Furthermore pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of medications are often found to be different in severely ill patients when compared to mild or moderately ill patients. However, the effects of different dosing schedules were only investigated to a very limited extent in non-randomized observational studies. Hence, evaluation of the PK/PD parameters of tocilizumab in severely ill patients – is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Added value of this study&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides valuable information about the population pharmacokinetics and dynamics of tocilizumab in dexamethasone cotreated ICU admitted COVID-19 patients. This research shows that there is no rationale for the 8 mg/kg dosing recommendation in ICU patients. Fixed dosing of 600 mg tocilizumab is a cost saving, logistically attractive and safe alternative without losing efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Implications of all the evidence&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the ongoing pandemic, shortages of tocilizumab and other IL-6 receptor antagonists may be anticipated. A fixed tocilizumab dose regimen has many practical and safety advantages, e.g. it will reduce dosing errors and avoid unnecessary wastage of medication. More importantly, according to the data presented in this study, relative underdosing of patients with low, or low-normal bodyweight compared to patients with high bodyweight will be avoided. Last but not least, in view of the large number of patients currently being treated with these agents, a significant cost saving can also be expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.10.21256933" rel="alternate" title="Fixed dosing of tocilizumab in ICU admitted COVID-19 patients is a superior choice compared to bodyweight based dosing; an observational population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study (30 tweets)"/><category term="Pharmacology and Therapeutics"/><published>2021-05-12T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.13.443734</id><title>CV2CoV, an enhanced mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate, supports higher protein expression and improved immunogenicity in rats (29 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.487075+00:00</updated><author><name>Nicole Roth</name></author><author><name>Jacob Schön</name></author><author><name>Donata Hoffmann</name></author><author><name>Moritz Thran</name></author><author><name>Andreas Thess</name></author><author><name>Stefan O.

Still, many challenges remain. The ongoing vaccination programs across the globe suffer from insufficient vaccine supply. The virus is adapting to the human host and novel variants are circulating that are neutralised less efficiently by antibodies raised against ancestral SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we describe CV2CoV, a second-generation mRNA vaccine developed for enhanced protein expression and immunogenicity. CV2CoV supports increased levels of protein expression in cell culture compared to our clinical candidate CVnCoV. Vaccination with CV2CoV induces high levels of virus neutralising antibodies with accelerated kinetics in rats. Robust antibody responses are reflected in significant cross-neutralisation of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, i.e. B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Together, these results underline the value of CV2CoV as next-generation SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.13.443734" rel="alternate" title="CV2CoV, an enhanced mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate, supports higher protein expression and improved immunogenicity in rats (29 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-05-13T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.443555</id><title>Mechanism of molnupiravir-induced SARS-CoV-2 mutagenesis (26 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.487467+00:00</updated><author><name>Florian Kabinger</name></author><author><name>Carina Stiller</name></author><author><name>Jana Schmitzová</name></author><author><name>Christian Dienemann</name></author><author><name>Hauke S.

Molnupiravir increases the frequency of viral RNA mutations&lt;sup&gt;3,4&lt;/sup&gt; and impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication in animal models&lt;sup&gt;4-6&lt;/sup&gt; and in patients&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Here we establish the molecular mechanisms that underlie molnupiravir-induced RNA mutagenesis by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Biochemical assays show that the RdRp readily uses the active form of molnupiravir, β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) triphosphate, as a substrate instead of CTP or UTP. Incorporation of NHC monophosphate into nascent RNA does not impair further RdRp progression. When the RdRp uses the resulting RNA as a template, NHC directs incorporation of either G or A, leading to mutated RNA products. Structural analysis of RdRp-RNA complexes containing mutagenesis products shows that NHC can form stable base pairs with either G or A in the RdRp active center, explaining how the polymerase escapes proofreading and synthesizes mutated RNA. This two-step mutagenesis mechanism likely applies to various viral polymerases and can explain the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of molnupiravir.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.443555" rel="alternate" title="Mechanism of molnupiravir-induced SARS-CoV-2 mutagenesis (26 tweets)"/><category term="Biochemistry"/><published>2021-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.07.21256823</id><title>Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Persist for up to 13 Months and Reduce Risk of Reinfection (25 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.487685+00:00</updated><author><name>Floriane Gallais</name></author><author><name>Pierre Gantner</name></author><author><name>Timothée Bruel</name></author><author><name>Aurelie Velay</name></author><author><name>Delphine Planas</name></author><author><name>Marie-Josée Wendling</name></author><author><name>Sophie Bayer</name></author><author><name>Morgane Solis</name></author><author><name>Elodie Laugel</name></author><author><name>Nathalie Reix</name></author><author><name>Anne Schneider</name></author><author><name>Ludovic Glady</name></author><author><name>Baptiste Panaget</name></author><author><name>Nicolas Collongues</name></author><author><name>Marialuisa Partisani</name></author><author><name>Jean-Marc Lessinger</name></author><author><name>Arnaud Fontanet</name></author><author><name>David Rey</name></author><author><name>Yves Hansmann</name></author><author><name>Laurence Kling-Pillitteri</name></author><author><name>Olivier Schwartz</name></author><author><name>Jérome De Sèze</name></author><author><name>Nicolas Meyer</name></author><author><name>Maria Gonzalez</name></author><author><name>Catherine Schmidt-Mutter</name></author><author><name>Samira Fafi-Kremer</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Assessment of the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is essential in predicting protection against reinfection and durability of vaccine protection. Here, we longitudinally measured Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (N)-specific antibodies in 1,309 healthcare workers (HCWs), including 916 COVID-19 negative HCWs and 393 convalescent COVID-19 for up to 422 days post-symptom. From month (M)1 to M7-9 post-infection, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies decreased moderately in convalescent HCWs in a biphasic model, with men showing a slower decay of anti-N (p=0.02), and a faster decay of anti-S (p=0.0008) than women. At M11-13, anti-N dramatically decreased (half-life: 283 days) while anti-S stabilized (half-life: 725 days) at a median of 2.39 log Arbitrary Units (AU)/mL (Interquartile Range (IQR): 2.10 -2.75). Overall, 69 SARS-CoV-2 infections developed in the COVID-19 negative group (incidence of 12.22 per 100 person-years) versus one in the COVID-19 positive group (incidence of 0.40 per 100 person-years), indicating a relative reduction in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection of 96.7% (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Correlation with live-virus neutralization assay revealed that variants D614G and B.1.1.7, but not B.1.351, were sensitive to anti-S antibodies at 2.3 log AU/mL, while IgG ≥ 3 log AU/mL neutralized all three variants. After SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, anti-S levels were increased by &amp;gt; 3 logs regardless of pre-vaccination IgG levels, type of vaccine, and number of doses. Our study demonstrates a long-term persistence of anti-S IgG antibodies that may protect against reinfection. By significantly increasing cross-neutralizing antibody titers, a single-dose vaccination strengthens protection against escape mutants.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.07.21256823" rel="alternate" title="Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies Persist for up to 13 Months and Reduce Risk of Reinfection (25 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.10.21256634</id><title>Humoral immunogenicity of the seasonal influenza vaccine before and after CAR-T-cell therapy (24 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.488072+00:00</updated><author><name>Carla S.

Vaccine immunogenicity is unknown in this population. We conducted a prospective observational study of the humoral immunogenicity of 2019-2020 inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) in children and adults immediately prior to (n=7) or 13-57 months after (n=15) CD19-, CD20-, or BCMA-targeted CAR-T-cell therapy, as well as controls (n=8). Individuals post-CAR-T-cell therapy were in remission. We tested for antibodies to 4 vaccine strains at baseline and ≥1 time point after IIV using neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition assays. An antibody response was defined as a ≥4-fold titer increase from baseline at the first post-vaccine time point. Baseline A(H1N1) titers in the CAR-T cohorts were significantly lower compared to controls. Antibody responses to ≥1 vaccine strain occurred in 2 (29%) individuals before CAR-T-cell therapy; one individual maintained a response for &amp;gt;3 months post-CAR-T-cell therapy. Antibody responses to ≥1 vaccine strain occurred in 6 (40%) individuals vaccinated after CAR-T-cell therapy. An additional 2 (29%) and 6 (40%) individuals had ≥2-fold increases (at any time) in the pre- and post-CAR-T cohorts, respectively. There were no identified clinical or immunologic predictors of antibody responses. Neither severe hypogammaglobulinemia nor B-cell aplasia precluded antibody responses. These data support consideration for vaccination before and after CAR-T-cell therapy for influenza and other relevant pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of hypogammaglobulinemia or B-cell aplasia. Larger studies are needed to determine correlates of vaccine immunogenicity and durability in CAR-T-cell therapy recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Key Points&lt;/title&gt;&lt;list list-type="bullet"&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Influenza vaccination was immunogenic pre- and post-CAR-T-cell therapy, despite hypogammaglobulinemia and B-cell aplasia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination with inactivated vaccines can be considered before CAR-T-cell therapy and in individuals with remission after therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.10.21256634" rel="alternate" title="Humoral immunogenicity of the seasonal influenza vaccine before and after CAR-T-cell therapy (24 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.12.21257083</id><title>Background rates of five thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndromes of special interest for COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance: incidence between 2017 and 2019 and patient profiles from 20.6 million people in six European countries (21 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.488353+00:00</updated><author><name>Edward Burn</name></author><author><name>Xintong Li</name></author><author><name>Kristin Kostka</name></author><author><name>Henry Morgan Stewart</name></author><author><name>Christian Reich</name></author><author><name>Sarah Seager</name></author><author><name>Talita Duarte-Salles</name></author><author><name>Sergio Fernandez-Bertolin</name></author><author><name>María Aragón</name></author><author><name>Carlen Reyes</name></author><author><name>Eugenia Martinez-Hernandez</name></author><author><name>Edelmira Marti</name></author><author><name>Antonella Delmestri</name></author><author><name>Katia Verhamme</name></author><author><name>Peter Rijnbeek</name></author><author><name>Daniel Prieto-Alhambra</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) has been reported among individuals vaccinated with adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccines. In this study we describe the background incidence of TTS in 6 European countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electronic medical records from France, Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom informed the study. Incidence rates of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and stroke, all with concurrent thrombocytopenia, were estimated among the general population between 2017 to 2019. A range of additional adverse events of special interest for COVID-19 vaccinations were also studied in a similar manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Findings&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 20,599,134 individuals were included. Background rates ranged from 1.0 (0.7 to 1.4) to 1.5 (1.0 to 2.0) per 100,000 person-years for DVT with thrombocytopenia, from 0.5 (0.3 to 0.6) to 1.4 (1.1 to 1.8) for PE with thrombocytopenia, from 0.1 (0.0 to 0.1) to 0.7 (0.5 to 0.9) for SVT with thrombocytopenia, and from 0.2 (0.0 to 0.4) to 4.4 (3.9 to 5.0) for stroke with thrombocytopenia. CVST with thrombocytopenia was only identified in one database, with incidence rate of 0.1 (0.0 to 0.2) per 100,000 person-years. The incidence of TTS increased with age, with those affected typically having more comorbidities and greater medication use than the general population. TTS was also more often seen in men than women. A sizeable proportion of those affected were seen to have been taking antithrombotic and anticoagulant therapies prior to their TTS event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Interpretation&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although rates vary across databases, TTS has consistently been seen to be a very rare event among the general population. While still very rare, rates of TTS are typically higher among older individuals, and those affected were also seen to generally be male and have more comorbidities and greater medication use than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Funding&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was funded by the European Medicines Agency (EMA/2017/09/PE Lot 3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Research in context&lt;/title&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Evidence before this study&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We searched PubMed to identify studies that have previously described the background incidence of the study outcomes. Estimates of the incidence of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) among the general population have ranged from 0.3 to 2 per 100,000 person-years. The background incidence of splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is not well-known, although the incidence of portal vein thrombosis, the most commonly involved vein, has been estimated at around 3 per 100,000 person-years. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are far more common with estimates of their incidence among the general population typically around 100 and 60 per 100,000 person-years respectively, while the incidence of stroke is typically estimated to be above 100 per 100,000 person-years. The background incidence of these events with concurrent thrombocytopenia has not, however, previously been described in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Added value of this study&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on spontaneous reports from the US, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) has been raised as a serious, albeit rare, adverse event that may be caused by adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccines. Assessing this safety signal requires a consideration of whether the rates of TTS being reported after vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 differ from those normally seen among the general population in the absence of any such vaccinations. This study brings together data from six European countries to estimate the background incidence of TTS. We used six large databases of routinely-collected data allowing for sufficient sample size to study TTS across multiple study populations and in different age and sex strata. Additionally, we characterised patients affected by TTS in historical data, describing their comorbidities and prior medication use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Implications of all the available evidence&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;TTS is very rare and based on the highest estimates among the databases included in this study, one would normally expect approximately 1 case of CVST with thrombocytopenia, 5 of SVT with thrombocytopenia, 11 of DVT with thrombocytopenia, 11 of PE with thrombocytopenia, and 34 of stroke with thrombocytopenia among a general population of 10 million individuals per 28 days. Expected events would however be higher for an older cohort, as patients with TTS are typically older than the general population. Patients with TTS are more often men and appear to typically have more comorbidities and greater medication use, including prior use of antithrombotic and anticoagulant therapies, than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only do the rates of TTS being reported among those who had received an adenovirus-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 raise a concern, but early evidence from spontaneous reports suggests that TTS among those vaccinated has been more commonly been seen among women and younger persons. While this might be in part explained by potential biases in spontaneous reporting, it also underlines the importance of further evaluation of the safety signal for TTS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with other adverse events of special interest for COVID-19 vaccines, estimates of TTS vary depending on the data source used. Comparison of observed versus expected TTS rates during the monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines should ideally be done using the same databases for the estimation of post-vaccine (observed) and background (expected) rates, with adjustment for patient characteristics (such as age and sex) done as part of the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.12.21257083" rel="alternate" title="Background rates of five thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndromes of special interest for COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance: incidence between 2017 and 2019 and patient profiles from 20.6 million people in six European countries (21 tweets)"/><category term="Hematology"/><published>2021-05-13T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.443384</id><title>Structure and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Spike N679-V687 deletion variant elucidate cell-type specific evolution of viral fitness (21 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.489141+00:00</updated><author><name>Kapil Gupta</name></author><author><name>Christine Toelzer</name></author><author><name>Maia Kavanagh Williamson</name></author><author><name>Deborah K.

In addition to this entrenched variant diversity in circulation, RNA viruses can also display genetic diversity within single infected hosts with co-existing viral variants evolving differently in distinct cell types. The BriSΔ variant, originally identified as a viral subpopulation by passaging SARS-CoV-2 isolate hCoV-19/England/02/2020, comprises in the spike glycoprotein an eight amino-acid deletion encompassing the furin recognition motif and S1/S2 cleavage site. Here, we analyzed the structure, function and molecular dynamics of this variant spike, providing mechanistic insight into how the deletion correlates to viral cell tropism, ACE2 receptor binding and infectivity, allowing the virus to probe diverse trajectories in distinct cell types to evolve viral fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Teaser&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 can exploit different cell types to diversify and evolve virus variants distinct in infectivity and structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.443384" rel="alternate" title="Structure and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Spike N679-V687 deletion variant elucidate cell-type specific evolution of viral fitness (21 tweets)"/><category term="Biochemistry"/><published>2021-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.15.444128</id><title>Pan-ErbB inhibition protects from SARS-CoV-2 replication, inflammation, and injury (19 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.492303+00:00</updated><author><name>Sirle Saul</name></author><author><name>Marwah Karim</name></author><author><name>Pei Tzu Huang</name></author><author><name>Luca Ghita</name></author><author><name>Winston Chiu</name></author><author><name>Sathish Kumar</name></author><author><name>Nishank Bhalla</name></author><author><name>Pieter Leyssen</name></author><author><name>Courtney A.

Seventeen candidates that rescue cells from SARS-CoV-2-induced lethality and target diverse functions emerged in a screen of 4,413 compounds. Among the hits was lapatinib, an approved inhibitor of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Lapatinib and other pan-ErbB inhibitors suppress replication of SARS-CoV-2 and unrelated viruses with a high barrier to resistance. ErbB4, but not lapatinib's cancer targets ErbB1 and ErbB2, is required for SARS-CoV-2 entry and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus infection and is a molecular target mediating lapatinib's antiviral effect. In human lung organoids, lapatinib protects from SARS-CoV-2-induced activation of pathways implicated in acute and chronic lung injury downstream of ErbBs (p38-MAPK, MEK/ERK, and AKT/mTOR), pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and epithelial barrier injury. These findings reveal regulation of viral infection, inflammation, and tissue injury via ErbBs and propose approved candidates to counteract these effects with implications for coronaviruses and unrelated viruses.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.15.444128" rel="alternate" title="Pan-ErbB inhibition protects from SARS-CoV-2 replication, inflammation, and injury (19 tweets)"/><category term="Microbiology"/><published>2021-05-16T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.12.443948</id><title>Plasmacytoid dendritic cells produce type I interferon and reduce viral replication in airway epithelial cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection (19 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.492817+00:00</updated><author><name>Luisa Cervantes-Barragan</name></author><author><name>Abigail Vanderheiden</name></author><author><name>Charlotte J.

Suthar</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic of unprecedented dimensions. SARS-CoV-2 infects airway and lung cells causing viral pneumonia. The importance of type I interferon (IFN) production for the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection is highlighted by the increased severity of COVID-19 in patients with inborn errors of type I IFN response or auto-antibodies against IFN-α. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a unique immune cell population specialized in recognizing and controlling viral infections through the production of high concentrations of type I IFN. In this study, we isolated pDCs from healthy donors and showed that pDCs are able to recognize SARS-CoV-2 and rapidly produce large amounts of type I IFN. Sensing of SARS-CoV-2 by pDCs was independent of viral replication since pDCs were also able to recognize UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and produce type I IFN. Transcriptional profiling of SARS-CoV-2 and UV-SARS-CoV-2 stimulated pDCs also showed a rapid type I and III IFN response as well as induction of several chemokines, and the induction of apoptosis in pDCs. Moreover, we modeled SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung using primary human airway epithelial cells (pHAEs) and showed that co-culture of pDCs with SARS-CoV-2 infected pHAEs induces an antiviral response and upregulation of antigen presentation in pHAE cells. Importantly, the presence of pDCs in the co-culture results in control of SARS-CoV-2 replication in pHAEs. Our study identifies pDCs as one of the key cells that can recognize SARS-CoV-2 infection, produce type I and III IFN and control viral replication in infected cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Importance&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type I interferons (IFNs) are a major part of the innate immune defense against viral infections. The importance of type I interferon (IFN) production for the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection is highlighted by the increased severity of COVID-19 in patients with defects in the type I IFN response. Interestingly, many cells are not able to produce type I IFN after being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and cannot control viral infection. In this study we show that plasmacytoid dendritic cells are able to recognize SARS-CoV-2 and produce type I IFN, and that pDCs are able to help control viral infection in SARS-CoV-2 infected airway epithelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.12.443948" rel="alternate" title="Plasmacytoid dendritic cells produce type I interferon and reduce viral replication in airway epithelial cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection (19 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-05-13T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.443592</id><title>Design and immunogenicity of a Pan-SARS-CoV-2 synthetic DNA vaccine (18 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.493475+00:00</updated><author><name>Charles C.

In response, next generation vaccines either matched to a single variant or designed to provide broader coverage across the VOC group are being developed. The latter pan-SARS-CoV-2 approach may offer substantial advantages in terms of cross-strain protection, immune coverage, reduced susceptibility to escape mutants, and non-restricted geographical use. Here we have employed our SynCon&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; design technology to construct a DNA vaccine expressing a pan-Spike immunogen (INO-4802) to induce broad immunity across SARS-CoV-2 variants. Compared to WT and VOC-matched vaccines which showed limited cross-neutralizing activity, INO-4802 induced potent neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses against WT as well as B.1.1.7, P.1, and B.1.351 VOCs in a murine model. In addition, a hamster vaccination model showed enhanced humoral responses against VOCs in a heterologous pWT prime/INO-4802 boost setting. These results demonstrate the potential of the pan-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, INO-4802 to induce cross-reactive immune responses against emerging VOCs as either a standalone vaccine, or as a potential boost for individuals previously immunized with WT-matched vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.443592" rel="alternate" title="Design and immunogenicity of a Pan-SARS-CoV-2 synthetic DNA vaccine (18 tweets)"/><category term="Immunology"/><published>2021-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.21256886</id><title>Lack of evidence for infectious SARS-CoV-2 in feces and sewage (17 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.493914+00:00</updated><author><name>Sandra Albert</name></author><author><name>Alba Ruíz</name></author><author><name>Javier Pemán</name></author><author><name>Miguel Salavert</name></author><author><name>Pilar Domingo-Calap</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Purpose&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is a respiratory virus whose primary route of transmission is airborne. However, it has been shown that the virus can replicate in gastrointestinal cells, can be excreted in feces, and can reach sewage systems. Although viral RNA has been found in patient feces and sewage, little is known about the potential fecal-oral transmission of the coronavirus. Determining the presence of infective viral particles in feces and sewage is necessary to take adequate control measures and to discover new routes of coronavirus transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feces and urine of COVID-19 patients, and wastewater samples at the time of high prevalence in the region under study (Valencia, Spain), have been analyzed both by molecular methods and cell culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presence of SARS-CoV-2 in feces of COVID-19 patients has been detected, even in patients without gastrointestinal symptoms, suggesting that viral shedding though stool is common. In addition, we have developed a sample concentration methodology that allows us to maintain the infectivity of the viral particles present in the samples. Finally, inoculation of cell cultures with fecal and sewage concentrated samples do not evidence the presence of infective viral particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no evidence of the presence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in feces and sewage, suggesting that fecal-oral transmission is not a primary route. However, larger-scale efforts are needed to elucidate whether the fecal-oral transmission should be considered, especially with the emergence of new viral variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.21256886" rel="alternate" title="Lack of evidence for infectious SARS-CoV-2 in feces and sewage (17 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.08.21256879</id><title>Prevalence and source analysis of COVID-19 misinformation of 138 countries (17 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.494306+00:00</updated><author><name>Md.

Collected from Poynter Institute’s official website and following a quantitative content analysis method along with descriptive statistical analysis, this research produces some novel insights regarding COVID-19 misinformation. The findings show that India (15.94%), the US (9.74%), Brazil (8.57%), and Spain (8.03%) are the four most misinformation-affected countries. Based on the results, it is presumed that the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation can have a positive association with the COVID-19 situation. Social media (84.94%) produces the highest amount of misinformation, and the internet (90.5%) as a whole is responsible for most of the COVID-19 misinformation. Moreover, Facebook alone produces 66.87% misinformation among all social media platforms. Of all countries, India (18.07%) produced the highest amount of social media misinformation, perhaps thanks to the country’s higher internet penetration rate, increasing social media consumption, and users’ lack of internet literacy. On the other hand, countries like Turkey, the US, Brazil, and the Philippines where either political control over media is intense or political conservatism is apparent, experienced a higher amount of misinformation from mainstream media, political figures, and celebrities. Although the prevalence of misinformation was the highest in March 2020, given the present trends, it may likely to increase slightly in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.08.21256879" rel="alternate" title="Prevalence and source analysis of COVID-19 misinformation of 138 countries (17 tweets)"/><category term="Public and Global Health"/><published>2021-05-12T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.21257011</id><title>COVID-19 in patients hospitalized and healthcare workers: what have changed after the first wave in a university hospital (16 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.494570+00:00</updated><author><name>Luiz Vinicius Leão Moreira</name></author><author><name>Gabriela Rodrigues Barbosa</name></author><author><name>Luciano Kleber de Souza Luna</name></author><author><name>Alberto Fernando Oliveira Justo</name></author><author><name>Ana Paula Cunha Chaves</name></author><author><name>Danielle Dias Conte</name></author><author><name>Joseane Mayara Almeida Carvalho</name></author><author><name>Ana Helena Perosa</name></author><author><name>Klinger Soares Faico Filho</name></author><author><name>Clarice Neves Camargo</name></author><author><name>Nancy Bellei</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Objective&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the COVID-19 frequency rates in hospitalized patients (HP) and healthcare workers (HCW), viral load inference, and the impact of vaccination and variants of concern (VOC) during the first pandemic wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluated the COVID-19 diagnostics at Hospital São Paulo, Brazil, from March 2020 to April 2021, in 10,202 samples (6,502 HP and 3,700 HCW) tested by RT-qPCR, inferring viral load by cycle threshold (Ct) values, and frequency rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 31.27% of individuals (32.23% HP and 29.80% HCW).

Allore</name></author><author><name>Susan Compton</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;At present, global immunity to SARS-CoV-2 resides within a heterogeneous combination of susceptible, naturally infected and vaccinated individuals. The extent to which viral shedding and transmission occurs on re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 after prior natural exposure or vaccination is an emerging area of understanding. We used Sialodacryoadenitis Virus (SDAV) in rats to model the extent to which immune protection afforded by prior natural infection via high risk (inoculation; direct contact) or low risk (fomite) exposure, or by vaccination, influenced viral shedding and transmission on re-exposure. On initial infection, we confirmed that amount, duration and consistency of viral shedding were correlated with exposure risk. Animals were reinfected after 3.7-5.5 months using the same exposure paradigm. Amount and duration of viral shedding were correlated with re-exposure type and serologic status. 59% of seropositive animals shed virus. Previously exposed seropositive reinfected animals were able to transmit virus to 25% of naive recipient rats after 24-hour exposure by direct contact. Rats vaccinated intranasally with a related virus (Parkers Rat Coronavirus) were able to transmit SDAV to only 4.7% of naive animals after a 7-day direct contact exposure, despite comparable viral shedding. Observed cycle threshold values associated with transmission in both groups ranged from 29-36 cycles, however observed shedding was not a prerequisite for transmission. Results indicate that low-level shedding in both naturally infected and vaccinated seropositive animals can propagate infection in susceptible individuals. Extrapolated to COVID-19, our results suggest that continued propagation of SARS-CoV-2 by seropositive previously infected or vaccinated individuals is possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.443477" rel="alternate" title="Viral shedding and transmission after natural infection and vaccination in an animal model of SARS-CoV-2 propagation (13 tweets)"/><category term="Microbiology"/><published>2021-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.21256972</id><title>SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce a greater array of spike-specific antibody isotypes with more potent complement binding capacity than natural infection (12 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.495280+00:00</updated><author><name>J&amp;eacuteromine Klingler</name></author><author><name>Gregory S Lambert</name></author><author><name>Vincenza Itri</name></author><author><name>Sean Liu</name></author><author><name>Juan C Bandres</name></author><author><name>Gospel Enyindah-Asonye</name></author><author><name>Xiaomei Liu</name></author><author><name>Kasopefoluwa Y Oguntuyo</name></author><author><name>Fatima Amanat</name></author><author><name>Benhur Lee</name></author><author><name>Susan Zolla-Pazner</name></author><author><name>Chitra Upadhyay</name></author><author><name>Catarina E Hioe</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Background: Mass vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is on-going in the United States with vaccines approved for emergency use by the FDA. Each vaccine can induce spike-specific antibodies (Abs) with virus-neutralizing activities; however, the Fc-mediated Ab activities have received little attention. Moreover, while plasma/serum Abs are commonly studied, scant information is available about Abs in the respiratory mucosa, the site of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Methods: Plasma and saliva were collected from mRNA vaccine recipients and convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Antigen-specific total Ig and Ig isotypes were measured. In addition to virus neutralization, Fc-mediated activities were investigated, including antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and complement deposition. 
Results: Similar to infection, vaccination stimulated spike-specific Ab responses detected in plasma and saliva, with IgG1 as the dominant isotype. Interestingly, vaccination produced greater IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 responses and higher ratios of (IgG1+IgG3)/(IgG2+IgG4) than infection. Moreover, while plasma neutralization and ADCP potencies were comparable in vaccinated and convalescent individuals, vaccine-induced plasma Abs elicited stronger complement binding and activation.
Conclusion: Compared with natural infection, mRNA vaccines induced a greater array of IgG subtypes against spike in saliva and plasma. The vaccine-induced Abs were also more potent in mediating complement activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.21256972" rel="alternate" title="SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines induce a greater array of spike-specific antibody isotypes with more potent complement binding capacity than natural infection (12 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-05-17T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.06.21256768</id><title>Antibody Response to COVID-19 vaccination in Patients Receiving Dialysis (12 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.495725+00:00</updated><author><name>Shuchi Anand</name></author><author><name>Maria E.

We used commercially available assays (Siemens) to test remainder plasma monthly in association with vaccination date and type, and assess prevalence of absent total receptor binding antibody, and absent or attenuated (index value &amp;lt; 10) semiquantitative receptor binding domain IgG index values. We used Poisson regression to evaluate risk factors for absent or attenuated response to vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among patients who were seronegative versus seropositive before vaccination, 62% and 56% were ≥65 years old, 20% and 24% were Hispanic, and 22% and 23% were Black. Median IgG index values rose steadily over time, and were higher among the seropositive than in the seronegative patients after completing vaccination (150 [25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 75&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; percentile 23.2, 150.0] versus 41.6 [11.3, 150.0]).

We used mixed effects logistic regression models that accounted for household structure to estimate the association between household overcrowding and SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proportion of participants with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result was highest in the overcrowded group (6.6%; 73/1,102) and lowest in the under-occupied group (2.9%; 682/23,219). In a mixed effects logistic regression model that included age, sex, ethnicity, household income and geographical region, we found strong evidence of an increased odds of having a positive PCR SARS-CoV-2 antigen result (Odds Ratio 3.72; 95% CI: 1.92, 7.13; p-value &amp;lt; 0.001) and increased odds of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody result in individuals living in overcrowded houses (2.96; 95% CI: 1.13, 7.74; p-value =0.027) compared to people living in under-occupied houses. The proportion of variation at the household level was 9.91% and 9.97% in the PCR and antibody models respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Discussion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health interventions to prevent and stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2 should consider the much greater risk of infection for people living in overcrowded households and pay greater attention to reducing household transmission. There is an urgent need to better recognise housing as a leading determinant of health in the context of a pandemic and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.10.21256912" rel="alternate" title="Household overcrowding and risk of SARS-CoV-2: analysis of the Virus Watch prospective community cohort study in England and Wales (11 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.10.443519</id><title>Dynamic Interactions of Fully Glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein with Various Antibodies (10 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.498061+00:00</updated><author><name>Yiwei Cao</name></author><author><name>Yeol Kyo Choi</name></author><author><name>Martin Frank</name></author><author><name>Hyeonuk Woo</name></author><author><name>Sang-Jun Park</name></author><author><name>Min Sun Yeom</name></author><author><name>Chaok Seok</name></author><author><name>Wonpil Im</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents a public health crisis, and the vaccines that can induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies are essential for ending the pandemic. The spike (S) protein on the viral envelope mediates human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding and thus is the target of a variety of neutralizing antibodies. In this work, we built various S trimer-antibody complex structures on the basis of the fully glycosylated S protein models described in our previous work, and performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to get insight into the structural dynamics and interactions between S protein and antibodies. Investigation of the residues critical for S-antibody binding allows us to predict the potential influence of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 variants. Comparison of the glycan conformations between S-only and S-antibody systems reveals the roles of glycans in S-antibody binding. In addition, we explored the antibody binding modes, and the influences of antibody on the motion of S protein receptor binding domains. Overall, our analyses provide a better understanding of S-antibody interactions, and the simulation-based S-antibody interaction maps could be used to predict the influences of S mutation on S-antibody interactions, which will be useful for the development of vaccine and antibody-based therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.10.443519" rel="alternate" title="Dynamic Interactions of Fully Glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein with Various Antibodies (10 tweets)"/><category term="Biophysics"/><published>2021-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.06.21256751</id><title>COVID-19 wastewater based epidemiology: long-term monitoring of 10 WWTP in France reveals the importance of the sampling context (9 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.498449+00:00</updated><author><name>A.

An extensive sampling campaign, including ten municipal wastewater treatment plants, has been conducted in different cities of France over a 20-weeks period, encompassing the second peak of COVID-19 outbreak in France. A well-recognised ultrafiltration - RNA extraction - RT-qPCR protocol was used and qualified, showing 5.5 +/-0.5% recovery yield on heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2. Importantly the whole, solid and liquid, fraction of wastewater was used for virus concentration in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Campaign results showed medium- to strong-correlation between SARS-CoV-2 WBE data and COVID-19 prevalence. To go further, WWTP inlet flow rate and raining statistical relationships were studied and taken into account for each WWTP in order to calculate contextualized SARS-CoV-2 loads. This metric presented improved correlation strengths with COVID-19 prevalence for WWTP particularly submitted and sensitive to rain. Such findings highlighted that SARS-CoV-2 WBE data ultimately require to be contextualised for relevant interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Highlights&lt;/title&gt;&lt;list list-type="order"&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;p&gt;First study monitoring inlet of 10 WWTPs located in France for SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification over a 20-weeks period encompassing the second peak of COVID-19 outbreak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral recovery yield was 5.5 % +/-0.5% using heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medium to high Spearman’s correlation strength was observed between SARS-CoV-2 WBE and COVID-19 prevalence data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;list-item&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering sampling context (ei. rain events) improved data consistency and correlation strength&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/list-item&gt;&lt;/list&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Graphical Abstract&lt;/title&gt;&lt;fig id="ufig1" position="float" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait"&gt;&lt;graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="21256751v1_ufig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" /&gt;&lt;/fig&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.06.21256751" rel="alternate" title="COVID-19 wastewater based epidemiology: long-term monitoring of 10 WWTP in France reveals the importance of the sampling context (9 tweets)"/><category term="Occupational and Environmental Health"/><published>2021-05-13T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.06.21256769</id><title>Pharmacogenomic and drug interaction risk associations with hospital length of stay among Medicare Advantage members with COVID-19 (9 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.498934+00:00</updated><author><name>Kristine Ashcraft</name></author><author><name>Chad Moretz</name></author><author><name>Chantelle Schenning</name></author><author><name>Susan Rojahn</name></author><author><name>Kae Vines Tanudtanud</name></author><author><name>Gwyn Omar Magoncia</name></author><author><name>Justine Reyes</name></author><author><name>Bernardo Marquez</name></author><author><name>Yinglong Guo</name></author><author><name>Elif Tokar Erdemir</name></author><author><name>Taryn O.

Reducing the hospital length of stay (LOS) reduces patient and hospital burden. Given that adverse drug reactions are known to prolong LOS, unmanaged pharmacogenomic risk and drug interactions among COVID-19 patients may be a risk factor for longer hospital stays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Objective&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to determine if pharmacogenomic and drug interaction risks were associated with longer lengths of stay among high-risk patients hospitalized with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Design&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retrospective cohort study of medical and pharmacy claims&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Setting&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Administrative database from a large U.S. health insurance company&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Participants&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare Advantage members with a first COVID-19 hospitalization between January 2020 and June 2020, who did not die during the stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Exposures&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) Pharmacogenetic interaction probability (PIP) of ≤25% (low), 26%–50% (moderate), or &amp;gt;50% (high), which indicate the likelihood that one or more clinically actionable gene-drug or gene-drug-drug interactions would be identified with testing; (2) drug-drug interaction (DDI) severity of minimal, minor, moderate, major, or contraindicated, which indicate the severity of an interaction between two or more active medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary outcome was hospital length of stay. Results were stratified by hierarchical condition categories (HCC) counts and chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 6,025 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were included in the study. Patients with moderate or high PIP were hospitalized for 9% (CI: 4%–15%; p &amp;lt; 0.001) and 16% longer (CI: 8%–24%; p &amp;lt; 0.001), respectively, compared to those with low PIP, whereas RAF score was not associated with LOS. High PIP was significantly associated with 12%–22% longer lengths of stay compared to low PIP in patients with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or COPD. Finally, among patients with 2 or 3 HCCs, a 10% longer length of stay was observed among patients with moderate or more severe DDI compared to minimal or minor DDI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proactively mitigating pharmacogenomic risk has the potential to reduce length of stay in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 especially those with COPD, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Key Points&lt;/title&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Question&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the impact of unmanaged pharmacogenomic risk among patients hospitalized with COVID-19?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Findings&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 6,025 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, those with greater unmanaged pharmacogenomic risk for adverse drug reactions had longer hospital stays than those with lower risk, both within the entire cohort and within groups matched by number and type of chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Meaning&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preemptive pharmacogenomic testing may shorten hospital stay by reducing adverse drug reactions among seriously ill patients and more broadly improve patient risk classification, care utilization predictions, and health system performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.06.21256769" rel="alternate" title="Pharmacogenomic and drug interaction risk associations with hospital length of stay among Medicare Advantage members with COVID-19 (9 tweets)"/><category term="Health Systems and Quality Improvement"/><published>2021-05-13T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.21257033</id><title>COVID-19: A comparative study of severity of patients hospitalized during the first and the second wave in South Africa (9 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.499286+00:00</updated><author><name>Caroline Maslo</name></author><author><name>Angeliki Messina</name></author><author><name>Anchen Laubscher</name></author><author><name>Mande Toubkin</name></author><author><name>Liza Sitharam</name></author><author><name>Charles Feldman</name></author><author><name>Guy A Richards</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Africa has experienced two waves of COVID-19 infections, the second of which was inter alia attributed to the emergence of a novel SARS-CoV2 variant, 501Y.V2. This variant possibly has increased virulence and may be associated with increased mortality. The objective of this study was to determine if patients admitted in the second wave had more severe illness and higher mortality than those admitted in the first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analysed and compared the characteristics, biological severity markers, treatments, level of care and outcomes of patients hospitalised in a private hospital in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to the first wave, patients admitted in the second were older and less likely to have co-morbidities. In contrast, the D-dimer and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were significantly higher. Despite this, significantly less patients were admitted to ICU and/or were mechanically ventilated. The total length of hospital stay was identical in both groups. Whereas the overall mortality was not significantly higher during the second wave, the ICU mortality was. Those that died in the second wave were older than those in the first wave. Multivariable logistic regression showed that being admitted during the second wave was an independent risk factor for mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study appears to confirm previous reports that the 501Y.V2 variant is possibly more virulent as indicated by the higher levels of D-dimer and IL-6, the slight increase in mortality of hospitalised patients and the higher ICU mortality in the second wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.21257033" rel="alternate" title="COVID-19: A comparative study of severity of patients hospitalized during the first and the second wave in South Africa (9 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.12.21256975</id><title>Inferring the COVID-19 IFR with a simple Bayesian evidence synthesis of seroprevalence study data and imprecise mortality data (9 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.499619+00:00</updated><author><name>Harlan Campbell</name></author><author><name>Paul Gustafson</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Estimating the COVID-19 infection fatality rate (IFR) has proven to be particularly challenging --and rather controversial-- due to the fact that both the data on deaths and the data on the number of individuals infected are subject to many different biases.

However, growing evidence confirms the relevant role of breast milk in providing passive immunity by generating and transmitting specific antibodies against the virus. Thus, our study aimed to develop and validate a specific protocol to detect SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk matrix as well as to determine the impact of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on presence, concentration, and persistence of specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Study design/Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prospective multicenter longitudinal study in Spain was carried out from April to December 2020. A total of 60 mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or recovered from COVID-19 were included (n=52 PCR-diagnosed and n=8 seropositive). Data from maternal-infant clinical records and symptomatology were collected. A specific protocol was validated to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in breast milk, targeting the N1 region of the nucleocapsid gene and the envelope (E) gene. Presence and levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulins (Igs) -IgA, IgG, and IgM-in breast milk samples from COVID-19 patients and from 13 women before the pandemic were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;All breast milk samples showed negative results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence. We observed high intra- and inter-individual variability in the antibody response to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for each of the three isotypes IgA, IgM and IgG. Protease domain (MPro) antibodies were also detected in milk. In general, 82.9 % of the milk samples were positive for at least one of the three antibody isotypes, being 52.86 % of those positive for all three Igs. Positivity rate for IgA was relatively stable over time (65.2 – 87.5 %), whereas it raised continuously for IgG (47.8 % the first ten days to 87.5 % from day 41 up to day 206 post-PCR confirmation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the lack of evidence for SARS-CoV-2 transmission through breast milk, our study confirms the safety of breastfeeding practices and highlights the relevance of virus-specific SARS-CoV-2 antibody transfer, that would provide passive immunity to breastfed infants and protect them against COVID-19 disease. This study provides crucial data to support official breastfeeding recommendations based on scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.06.21256766" rel="alternate" title="SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibody detection in human milk from a prospective multicenter study in Spain (8 tweets)"/><category term="Pediatrics"/><published>2021-05-13T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.10.21256935</id><title>Identifying risk factors for COVID-19 severity and mortality in the UK Biobank (7 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.500148+00:00</updated><author><name>Iqbal Madakkatel</name></author><author><name>Catherine King</name></author><author><name>Ang Zhou</name></author><author><name>Anwar Mulugeta</name></author><author><name>Amanda Lumsden</name></author><author><name>Mark McDonnell</name></author><author><name>Elina Hyppönen</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has infected over 114 million people worldwide as of March 2021, with worldwide mortality rates ranging between 1-10%.

Changes in anxiety symptoms were close to zero and not statistically significant in university students (SMD = 0.00, 95% CI - 0.35 to 0.36, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 95.4%; 5 studies, N = 1,537); women or females (SMD = 0.02, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.39, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 92.3%; 3 studies, N = 2,778); and men or males (SMD = 0.07, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.15; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.01%; 3 studies, N = 1,250); anxiety symptoms increased, however, among people with pre-existing medical conditions (SMD = 0.27, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.54, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 91.0%; 3 studies, N = 2,053). Changes in depression symptoms were close to zero or small and not statistically significant among university students (SMD = 0.19, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.45, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 91.8%; 5 studies, N = 1,537); people with pre-existing medical conditions (SMD = 0.01, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.17, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 14.9%; 3 studies, N = 2,006); women or females (SMD = 0.21, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.55, I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 91.2%; 3 studies, N = 2,843); and men or males (SMD = 0.00, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.22; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 92.3%; 4 studies, N = 3,661). In 3 studies with data from both March to June 2020 and September to November 2020, symptoms were unchanged from pre-COVID-19 at both time points or there were increases at the first assessment that had largely dissipated by the second assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence does not suggest a widespread negative effect on mental health symptoms in COVID-19, although it is possible that gaps in data have not allowed identification of changes in some vulnerable groups.

COVID – 19 is found to bind with the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors for viral entry. ACE2 receptors are normally expressed in various body surfaces as well as in the neurons and glial cells where they act as an entry port to SARS-CoV-2 infection to invade the central nervous system (CNS). ACE2 are also highly expressed in dopamine neurons which might worsen the outcome in terms of motor symptoms in PD with the treatment course. It may lead to an indirect response via immune-mediated cytokine storms and propagate through CNS leading to damage. Parkinson’s disease has also been noticed due to certain post-viral infections apart from COVID-19 such as, HSV, Influenza virus A, Measles virus, Cytomegalovirus and Mumps (Olsen et al, 2018). We aim to provide a thorough review on neurological outcomes and impact of COVID-19 in Parkinson disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic review was conducted to analyze the impact of COVID-19 in patients with Parkinson disease (&amp;gt; 21 yo). Systematic literature search was done using PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar and Cochrane databases. PRISMA guidelines were followed summarized in Fig. 3 for study acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the Parkinson’s patients that were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, worsening of motor symptoms were reported along with other COVID-19 symptoms (Fig. 4 and 5). These symptoms include bradykinesia, tremors, gait disturbances, delirium and dementia and severe spasms of arms and legs. Encephalopathy was also one of the main symptoms presented in two of the studies. Increased mortality rates were identified for those who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 and PD when compared to other patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease may experience substantial worsening of motor and non -motor symptoms during COVID 19. Due to the novelty of the virus, studies were reported from recent years and further extensive studies are needed to explore more about the disease severity and neurological outcomes when compared to other non-PD patients. Authors identify this as a limitation for this paper. Additional studies are needed to understand the role of ACE2 in increasing vulnerability to viruses and role of ACE inhibitors as treatment modality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.09.21256929" rel="alternate" title="INFLUENCE OF NOVEL CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19) ON PARKINSON’S DISEASE: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW (6 tweets)"/><category term="Neurology"/><published>2021-05-12T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.443443</id><title>SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern Substitutions Alter Spike Glycoprotein Receptor Binding Domain Structure and Stability (6 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.500993+00:00</updated><author><name>Daniel L.

The rapid development and deployment of extremely effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 has made the end of the pandemic a reality within reach. However, as the virus spreads it has acquired mutations; and thus, variants of concern have emerged that are more infectious and reduce the efficacy of existing vaccines. While promising efforts are underway to combat these variants, the evolutionary pressures leading to these variants are poorly understood. To that end, here we have studied the effects of three amino-acid substitutions on the structure and function of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain found in several variants of concern such as B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 that are now circulating. We found that these substitutions alter the RBD structure and stability, as well as its ability to bind to ACE2, which may have opposing and compensatory effects. These findings provide new insights into how these Variants of Concern (VOC) may have been selected to optimize infectivity while maintaining the structure and stability of the receptor binding domain.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.443443" rel="alternate" title="SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern Substitutions Alter Spike Glycoprotein Receptor Binding Domain Structure and Stability (6 tweets)"/><category term="Biochemistry"/><published>2021-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.06.21256773</id><title>Risk of COVID-19 infection and work place exposure of front-line mass media professionals (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.501915+00:00</updated><author><name>Sarabon Tahura</name></author><author><name>Bilkis Banu</name></author><author><name>Nasrin Akter</name></author><author><name>Sarder Mahmud Hossain</name></author><author><name>Rashidul Alam Mahumud</name></author><author><name>Md Rishad Ahmed</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Introduction&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mass media plays a crucial role in creating awareness and knowledge sharing in this Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the risk of exposure and extent of COVID-19 infection among media professional are less elucidated yet. Therefore, this study was intended to investigate the workplace-related risk of COVID-19 exposure and the association between exposure to COVID-19 and participant’s characteristics, including various forms of respiratory protection for mass-media professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;This closed web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 199 mass-media professionals in Bangladesh by snowball sampling approach. A multivariate logistic regression model was used for the analytical exploration. Adjusted and Unadjusted Odds Ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for the specified exposures. Chi-square test was used to observe the association. Ethical issues were maintained according to the guidance of the declaration of the Helsinki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all, 39.2% of mass-media professionals were tested positive for COVID-19, whereas 6% of symptomatic or suspected participants did not do the test. Mass media professionals who worked in electronic media reported more COVID-19 infection (adjusted odds ratio, AOR= 6.25; 95% Confidence interval: Lower limit 1.43, upper limit 27.43; P =0.02). However, no significant relationship was found between the type of job role and COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, infected colleagues (OR/P=1.92/0.04) were identified as significant contact of acquiring infection. However, the study result showed that reused/new medical mask, homemade/cloth-made mask (vs. use of respirator mask) was not significantly (p=0.82) associated with mass media professional’s infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professionals working in electronic media were at higher risk of being infected by COVID-19 and mostly acquired from infected colleagues. Using a respirator mask was not associated with a lower risk of test positive infection in mass media professionals.

Widespread detection of variant strains will be critical to inform policy decisions to mitigate further spread, and post-pandemic multiplexed screening of respiratory viruses will be necessary to properly manage patients presenting with similar respiratory symptoms. In this work, we have developed a portable, magnetofluidic cartridge platform for automated PCR testing in &amp;lt;30 min. Cartridges were designed for multiplexed detection of SARS-CoV-2 with either distinctive variant mutations or with Influenza A and B. The platform demonstrated a limit of detection down to 2 copies/µL SARS-CoV-2 RNA with successful identification of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. The multiplexed SARS-CoV-2/Flu assay was validated using archived clinical nasopharyngeal swab eluates (&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt; = 116) with an overall sensitivity/specificity of 98.1%/95.2%, 85.7%/100%, 100%/98.2%, respectively, for SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, and Influenza B. Further testing with saliva (&lt;italic&gt;n&lt;/italic&gt; = 14) demonstrated successful detection of all SARS-CoV-2 positive samples with no false-positives.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.10.21256995" rel="alternate" title="Magnetofluidic platform for rapid multiplexed screening of SARS-CoV-2 variants and respiratory pathogens (5 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-05-11T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.12.21257125</id><title>COVID-19 Serology in New York State Using a Multiplex Microsphere Immunoassay (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.502649+00:00</updated><author><name>Danielle T.

Here, we describe a multiplexed serological assay developed as the global pandemic moved into New York State in the spring of 2020. The original microsphere immunoassay used a target antigen from the SARS-CoV-1 virus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, but evolved to incorporate multiple SARS-CoV-2 protein antigens (nucleocapsid, spike and spike domains, spike and nucleocapsid proteins from seasonal human coronaviruses). Besides being highly versatile due to multiplex capabilities, the assay was highly specific and sensitive and adaptable to measuring both total antibodies and antibody isotypes. While determining the assay performance characteristics, we were able to identify antibody production patterns (e.g., kinetics of isotypes, individual variations) for total antibodies and individual antibody classes. Overall, the results provide insights into the laboratory response to new serology needs, and how the evolution and fine-tuning of a serology assay helped contribute to a better understanding of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.12.21257125" rel="alternate" title="COVID-19 Serology in New York State Using a Multiplex Microsphere Immunoassay (5 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.12.21257107</id><title>The Impact of Universal Transport Media and Viral Transport Media Liquid Samples on a SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.503327+00:00</updated><author><name>J Mayfield</name></author><author><name>P Hesse</name></author><author><name>D Ledden</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The impact of universal transport media (UTM) and viral transport media (VTM) liquid samples on the performance of the Healgen Scientific Rapid COVID-19 Antigen Test was investigated.

To understand the cause of these false-positive results, the effect of extraction buffer dilution on sample pH, surfactant concentration, and ionic strength were investigated. The most important factor in UTM/VTM liquid sample dilution of the extraction buffer was ionic strength as measured by conductivity. Dilutions with conductivity below ∼17 mS/cm can induce a false-positive result. It was also noted that the ionic strength of UTM/VTMs can vary, and those with low ionic strength can be problematic. To rule out the effect of other common components found in UTMs/VTMs, several materials were mixed with extraction buffer and tested at high concentrations. None was shown to produce false-positive results.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.12.21257107" rel="alternate" title="The Impact of Universal Transport Media and Viral Transport Media Liquid Samples on a SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (5 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-05-13T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.21257021</id><title>Establishment of an evaluation panel for the decentralized technical evaluation of the sensitivity of 31 rapid detection tests for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.503721+00:00</updated><author><name>Andreas Puyskens</name></author><author><name>Eva Krause</name></author><author><name>Janine Michel</name></author><author><name>Micha Nübling</name></author><author><name>Heinrich Scheiblauer</name></author><author><name>Daniel Bourquain</name></author><author><name>Marica Grossegesse</name></author><author><name>Roman Valusenko</name></author><author><name>Viktor Corman</name></author><author><name>Christian Drosten</name></author><author><name>Katrin Zwirglmaier</name></author><author><name>Roman Wölfel</name></author><author><name>Constanze Lange</name></author><author><name>Jan Kramer</name></author><author><name>Johannes Friesen</name></author><author><name>Ralf Ignatius</name></author><author><name>Michael Müller</name></author><author><name>Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit</name></author><author><name>Petra Emmerich</name></author><author><name>Lars Schaade</name></author><author><name>Andreas Nitsche</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Background&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The detection of SARS-CoV-2 with rapid diagnostic tests has become an important tool to identify infected people and break infection chains. These rapid diagnostic tests are usually based on antigen detection in a lateral flow approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Aims &amp;amp; Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;While for PCR diagnostics the validation of a PCR assay is well established, for antigen tests e.g. rapid diagnostic tests there is no common validation strategy. Here we present the establishment of a panel of 50 pooled clinical specimens that cover a SARS-CoV-2 concentration range from approximately 1.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; to 420 genome copies per mL of specimen. The panel was used to evaluate 31 rapid diagnostic tests in up to 6 laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show that there is significant variation in the detection limits and the clinical sensitivity of different rapid diagnostic tests. We conclude that the best rapid diagnostic tests can be applied to reliably identify infectious individuals who are presenting with SARS-CoV-2 loads correlated to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; genome copies per mL of specimen. Infected individuals displaying SARS-CoV-2 genome loads corresponding to less than 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; genome copies per mL will be identified by only some rapid diagnostics tests, while many tests miss these viral loads to a large extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensitive RDTs can be applied to identify infectious individuals with high viral loads, but not to identify infected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.21257021" rel="alternate" title="Establishment of an evaluation panel for the decentralized technical evaluation of the sensitivity of 31 rapid detection tests for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics (5 tweets)"/><category term="Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)"/><published>2021-05-13T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.13.444021</id><title>Global mapping of RNA homodimers in living cells (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-18T05:45:25.504619+00:00</updated><author><name>Marta M Gabryelska</name></author><author><name>Grzegorz Kudla</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;RNA homodimerization is important for various physiological processes, including the assembly of membraneless organelles, RNA subcellular localization, and packaging of viral genomes. However, understanding of RNA homodimerization has been hampered by the lack of systematic in vivo detection methods. Here we show that PARIS, COMRADES, and other RNA proximity ligation methods can detect RNA homodimers transcriptome-wide as "overlapping" chimeric reads that contain more than one copy of the same sequence. Analysing published proximity ligation datasets, we show that RNA:RNA homodimers mediated by direct base-pairing interactions are rare across the transcriptome, but highly enriched in specific transcripts, including U8 snoRNA, U2 snRNA and a subset of tRNAs. Analysis of data from virus-infected cells reveals homodimerization of SARS-CoV-2 and Zika genomes, mediated by specific palindromic sequences located within protein-coding regions of N protein in SARS-CoV-2 and NS2A gene in Zika. We speculate that regions of viral genomes involved in homodimerization may constitute effective targets for antiviral therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.13.444021" rel="alternate" title="Global mapping of RNA homodimers in living cells (5 tweets)"/><category term="Systems Biology"/><published>2021-05-17T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry></feed>
