In the present study, we explored the effects of NPGL on feeding behavior and energy metabolism in mice placed on a long-term high-fat diet with 60% calories from fat (HFD 60). Overexpression of the NPGL precursor gene &lt;italic&gt;(Npgl&lt;/italic&gt;) over 18 weeks increased food intake and body mass. The weekly body mass gain of &lt;italic&gt;Npgl&lt;/italic&gt;-overexpressing mice was higher than that of controls until 7 weeks from induction of overexpression, after which it ceased to be so. Oral glucose tolerance tests showed that &lt;italic&gt;Npgl&lt;/italic&gt; overexpression maintained glucose tolerance and increased blood insulin levels, and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests showed that it maintained insulin sensitivity. At the experimental endpoint, &lt;italic&gt;Npgl&lt;/italic&gt; overexpression was associated with increased mass of the perirenal white adipose tissue (WAT) and decreased mass of the epididymal WAT (eWAT), resulting in little effect on the total WAT mass. These results suggest that under long-term HFD 60 feeding, &lt;italic&gt;Npgl&lt;/italic&gt; overexpression may play a role in avoiding metabolic disturbance both by accelerating energy storage and by suppressing excess fat accumulation in certain tissues, such as the eWAT.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.453688" rel="alternate" title="Overexpression of the gene encoding neurosecretory protein GL precursor prevents excessive fat accumulation in the adipose tissue of mice fed a long-term high-fat diet (3 tweets)"/><category term="Physiology"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry></feed>
