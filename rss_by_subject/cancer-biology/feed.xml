BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is a common childhood infection that can be reactivated in the adult kidney leading to viruria. Here we used a mitotically-quiescent, differentiated, normal human urothelial &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt; model to study BKPyV infection. BKPyV infection led to significantly elevated APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B protein, increased deaminase activity and greater numbers of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites in the host urothelial genome. BKPyV Large T antigen (LT-Ag) stimulated re-entry into the cell cycle via inhibition of Retinoblastoma protein and activation of EZH2, E2F1 and FOXM1, which combined to push urothelial cells from G0 into an arrested G2 cell cycle state. The single-stranded DNA displacement loops formed during BKPyV-infection, provide a substrate for APOBEC3 enzymes where they interacted with LT-Ag. These results support reactivated BKPyV infections in adults as a risk factor for bladder cancer in immune-insufficient populations, including transplant patients and the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.13.443803" rel="alternate" title="BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is a risk factor for bladder cancer through induction of APOBEC3-mediated genomic damage (6 tweets)"/><category term="Cancer Biology"/><published>2021-05-17T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.18.444603</id><title>Intratumoural heterogeneity and immune modulation in lung adenocarcinoma of female smokers and never smokers (5 tweets)</title><updated>2021-05-24T05:58:18.503415+00:00</updated><author><name>Timo Trefzer</name></author><author><name>Marc A.

Although lung cancer is highly associated with smoking status, a significant proportion of lung cancer cases develop in patients who never smoked, with an observable bias towards female never smokers. A better understanding of lung cancer heterogeneity and immune system involvement during tumour evolution and progression in never smokers is therefore highly warranted. We employed single nucleus transcriptomics of surgical lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) and normal lung tissue samples from patients with or without smoking history. Immune cells as well as fibroblasts and endothelial cells respond to tobacco smoke exposure by inducing a highly inflammatory state in normal lung tissue. In the presence of LADC, we identified differentially expressed transcriptional programmes in macrophages and cancer-associated fibroblasts, providing insight into how the niche favours tumour progression. Within tumours, we distinguished eight subpopulations of neoplastic cells in female smokers and never smokers. Through pseudotemporal ordering, we inferred a trajectory towards two differentiated tumour cell states implicated in cancer progression and invasiveness. A proliferating cell population sustaining tumour growth exhibits differential immune modulating signatures in both patient groups. Our results resolve cellular heterogeneity and immune interactions in LADC, with a special emphasis on female never smokers and implications for the design of therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.18.444603" rel="alternate" title="Intratumoural heterogeneity and immune modulation in lung adenocarcinoma of female smokers and never smokers (5 tweets)"/><category term="Cancer Biology"/><published>2021-05-18T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry></feed>
