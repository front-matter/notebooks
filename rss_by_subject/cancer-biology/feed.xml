Recent &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt; and &lt;italic&gt;in vivo&lt;/italic&gt; data has indicated the high metastatic fitness of hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) states, i.e. their enhanced abilities to initiate tumours at secondary tumour site. Mechanistic details about how such hybrid E/M cells survive the metastatic cascade remain unclear. Here, Univwe investigate immune-evasive strategies of hybrid E/M states, an issue that to date has been largely unexplored. We construct a minimalistic regulatory network that captures known associations between regulators of EMT (the epithelial mesenchymal transition) and levels of PD-L1, an established suppressor of immune response, and simulated the networkâ€™s emergent dynamics. Our model recapitulates observations that cells undergoing EMT have increased PD-L1 levels, while reverting EMT can decrease these levels, indicative of a causal link between EMT drivers and PD-L1. Further, we show that hybrid E/M cells can have high levels of PD-L1, similar to those seen in cells with a full EMT phenotype, thus obviating the need for cancer cells to undergo a full EMT to evade the immune system. Finally, we identify various signalling pathways and cellular processes that can independently or in concert affect PD-L1 levels and EMT status. For instance, hybrid E/M cells can gain both immune-evasion and stemness through largely independent paths. Our results underscore another underlying reason for the high metastatic ability of hybrid E/M cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.21.449285" rel="alternate" title="Immunosuppressive traits of the hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype (9 tweets)"/><category term="Cancer Biology"/><published>2021-06-22T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry></feed>
