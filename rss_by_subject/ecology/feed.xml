Hood</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Bioavailable phosphorus exports from rivers during high flow often fuel downstream harmful cyanobacterial blooms; yet whether river phosphorus cycles affect these exports is unclear. Here, we examined river phosphorus cycling during high flow events in a large agricultural watershed that drives cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Erie. We show that between 2003 and 2019 river phosphorus cycles, through phosphorus sorption, reduced bioavailable phosphorus exports by 24%, potentially constraining Lake Erie cyanobacterial blooms by 61%. Over the last 45-years, phosphorus sorption has declined with suspended sediment exports due to increases in soil-erosion-minimizing agricultural practices, likely contributing to recent cyanobacterial blooms. In this, and likely other agricultural watersheds, rivers perform an unrecognized ecosystem service during high flow creating field-river-lake linkages that need to be incorporated into phosphorus management.&lt;/p&gt;</content><published>2021-05-03T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry></feed>
