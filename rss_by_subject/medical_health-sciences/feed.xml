To explore whether α-synuclein in KD has pathological similarities to that in LBD, we compared &lt;italic&gt;post-mortem&lt;/italic&gt; KD tissue to that of infant control cases and identified alterations to α-synuclein localisation and expression of modifications associated with LBD. To determine whether α-synuclein in KD displayed pathogenic properties associated with LBD we evaluated its seeding capacity using the real-time quaking-induced conversion assay. Strikingly, seeded aggregation of α-synuclein resulted in the formation of fibrillar aggregates similar to those observed in LBD, confirming the prion-like capacity of KD-derived α-synuclein. These observations constitute the first report of prion-like α-synuclein in the brain tissue of infants and challenge the putative view that α-synuclein pathology is merely an age-associated phenomenon, instead suggesting it can result from alterations to biological processes such as sphingolipid homeostasis. Our findings have important implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying Lewy body formation in LBD.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.12.463948" rel="alternate" title="Prion-like α-synuclein pathology in the brains of infants: Krabbe disease as a novel seed-competent α-synucleinopathy (19 tweets)"/><category term="Pathology"/><published>2021-10-14T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.08.21264727</id><title>Exoskeleton-assisted walking improves pulmonary and exercise performances more than conventional exercise program in individuals with spinal cord injury: a randomised controlled study (16 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-18T08:35:20.812049+00:00</updated><author><name>Xiao-Na Xiang</name></author><author><name>Li-Ming Zhang</name></author><author><name>Hui-Yan Zong</name></author><author><name>Yi Ou</name></author><author><name>Xi Yu</name></author><author><name>Yan Liu</name></author><author><name>Hong-Ying Jiang</name></author><author><name>Hong Cheng</name></author><author><name>Hong-Chen He</name></author><author><name>Cheng-Qi He</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Question&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;In people with spinal cord injury, does exoskeleton-assisted walking training improve pulmonary ventilation function, motor function and related body structure, walking, and activities of daily life equally comparing those with conventional exercise program?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Design&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randomised controlled trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Intervention&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups undertook 16 sessions of 50-60min training (4 days/week, 4 weeks). Participants in the experimental group received EAW trainings using AIDER system, which assisted standing, walking, and climbing the stairs. The control group received a conventional exercise program which combined aerobic, resistance, flexibility and walking training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Outcome measures&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary outcome was the pulmonary function test. The secondary outcomes included: a 6-minute walk test with Borg scale (0 to 10) rating of exertion, 10-metre walk test, basic activities of daily living, trunk control test, lower extremity motor score, muscle tone of lower limb, bone mineral density, and distal femoral cartilage at baseline and upon completion of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 4 weeks of trainings, the experimental group improved more on the forced vital capacity (MD 0.53, 95%CI 0.01 to 1.06), predicted FVC% (MD 19.59, 95%CI 6.63 to 32.54) and forced expiratory volume in 1s (MD 0.61, 95%CI 0.15 to 1.07); BADL (MD 19.75, 95%CI 10.88 to 28.62); and distal femoral cartilage than the control group. Participants completed 6-minute walk test with median 17.3 meters while wearing the exoskeleton.

Genetic analysis of its role in chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not been performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We constructed a genetic instrument by selecting variants associated with &lt;italic&gt;ACLY&lt;/italic&gt; expression level in the expression quantitative trait loci genetics consortium (eQTLGen) that includes blood samples from 31,684 participants. In a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis, we then evaluated the effect of genetically predicted &lt;italic&gt;ACLY&lt;/italic&gt; expression on risk of CKD, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and microalbuminuria using the CKD Genetics consortium (CKDGen), United Kingdom biobank, and the Finnish Genetics consortium (FinnGen) totaling 66,396 CKD cases and 958,517 controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;italic&gt;ACLY&lt;/italic&gt; is constitutively expressed in all cell types including in whole blood. The genetic instrument included 13 variants and explained 1.5% of variation in whole blood &lt;italic&gt;ACLY&lt;/italic&gt; gene expression. A 34% reduction in genetically predicted &lt;italic&gt;ACLY&lt;/italic&gt; expression was associated with a 0.04 mmol/L reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (&lt;italic&gt;P&lt;/italic&gt; = 3.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;) and a 9% reduced risk of CKD (stage 3,4,5, dialysis or eGFR below 60 ml/min/1.73m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) (OR = 0.91, 95% C.I. 0.85-0.98, &lt;italic&gt;P&lt;/italic&gt; = 0.008), but no association was observed with eGFR nor microalbuminuria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mendelian Randomization analysis provides cautious optimism regarding the possibility of ACLY as a therapeutic target for CKD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.07.21264710" rel="alternate" title="ATP-citrate lyase as a therapeutic target in chronic kidney disease: a Mendelian Randomization analysis (5 tweets)"/><category term="Nephrology"/><published>2021-10-11T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.16.464646</id><title>Pharmacological mechanisms on the anti-breast cancer property of Coix lacryma-jobi: A network-based analysis (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-10-18T08:35:20.812950+00:00</updated><author><name>Angelu Mae A Ferrer</name></author><author><name>Janella Rayne A David</name></author><author><name>Arvin A Taquiqui</name></author><author><name>Arci A Bautista</name></author><author><name>Custer C Deocaris</name></author><author><name>Malona Velasco Alinsug</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer is considered as one of the three most common cancers around the world and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women. Coix lachrymal jobi, commonly known as Jobs tears or adlay has been reported to possess anti-cancer properties. Despite evidences provided by clinical data, the usage of Coix lacryma-jobi in treating cancer, particularly breast cancer, has been scarce. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the pharmacological mechanisms underlying its anti-breast cancer property using various network pathway analyses. Bioactive compounds from Coix lacryma-jobi and its potential target genes were obtained from SymMap. Breast cancer-related target genes were collected from CTD. Protein-protein interaction network was analyzed using the STRING database. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed using DAVID to further explore the mechanisms of Coix lacryma-jobi in treating breast cancer. PPI and compound-target-pathway were visualized using Cytoscape. A total of 26 bioactive compounds, 201 corresponding targets, 36625 breast cancer-associated targets were obtained, and 200 common targets were considered potential therapeutic targets. The 9 bioactive compounds identified were berberine, oleic acid, beta-sitosterol, sitosterol, linoleic acid, berberrubine, jatrorrhizine, thalifendine, and stigmasterol. The identified 5 core targets were ESR1, JUN, MAPK14, and RXRA.  Coix lacryma-jobi targets enriched in GO terms were mostly involved in regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, drug response, steroid hormone receptor activity, and protein binding. This study elucidates on the pharmacological underpinnings on the potency of adlay against breast cancer.  Its subsequent drug development will be worth a step forward for a breast cancer-free society.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.16.464646" rel="alternate" title="Pharmacological mechanisms on the anti-breast cancer property of Coix lacryma-jobi: A network-based analysis (3 tweets)"/><category term="Pharmacology and Toxicology"/><published>2021-10-16T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry></feed>
