Here, we performed gene-level collapsing analysis on exome sequences from 454,796 multi-ancestry UK Biobank participants to detect genetic associations with diabetes. Rare non-synonymous variants in &lt;italic&gt;GCK, GIGYF1, HNF1A&lt;/italic&gt;, and &lt;italic&gt;HNF4A&lt;/italic&gt; were significantly associated (&lt;italic&gt;P&lt;/italic&gt;&amp;lt;1×10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt;) with increased risk of diabetes, whereas rare non-synonymous variants in &lt;italic&gt;MAP3K15&lt;/italic&gt; were significantly associated with reduced risk of diabetes. Recessive carriers of rare non-synonymous variants in the X chromosome gene &lt;italic&gt;MAP3K15&lt;/italic&gt; had a 30% reduced risk of diabetes (OR=0.70, 95% CI: [0.62,0.79], &lt;italic&gt;P&lt;/italic&gt;=5.7×10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt;), along with reduced blood glucose (beta=-0.13, 95% CI: [-0.15,-0.10], &lt;italic&gt;P&lt;/italic&gt;=5.5×10&lt;sup&gt;-18&lt;/sup&gt;) and reduced glycosylated haemoglobin levels (beta=-0.14, 95% CI: [-0.16,-0.11], &lt;italic&gt;P&lt;/italic&gt;=1.1×10&lt;sup&gt;-24&lt;/sup&gt;). Hemizygous males carrying protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in &lt;italic&gt;MAP3K15&lt;/italic&gt; demonstrated a 40% reduced risk of diabetes (OR=0.60, 95% CI: [0.45,0.81], &lt;italic&gt;P=&lt;/italic&gt;0.0007). These findings were independently replicated in FinnGen, with a &lt;italic&gt;MAP3K15&lt;/italic&gt; PTV associating with decreased risk of both type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) (p&amp;lt;0.05). The effect of &lt;italic&gt;MAP3K15&lt;/italic&gt; loss on diabetes was independent of body mass index, suggesting its protective effect is unlikely to be mediated via the insulin resistance pathway. Tissue expression profile of &lt;italic&gt;MAP3K15&lt;/italic&gt; indicates a possible involvement of pancreatic islet cell or stress response pathways. No safety concerns were identified among heterozygous or recessive &lt;italic&gt;MAP3K15&lt;/italic&gt; PTV carriers across over 15,719 studied endpoints in the UK Biobank. Human population genetic evidence supports &lt;italic&gt;MAP3K15&lt;/italic&gt; inhibition as a novel therapeutic target for diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.14.21266328" rel="alternate" title="Human genetic evidence supports MAP3K15 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for diabetes (41 tweets)"/><category term="Genetic and Genomic Medicine"/><published>2021-11-15T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.18.468552</id><title>Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras With Reduced Off-targets (35 tweets)</title><updated>2021-11-22T12:05:39.916298+00:00</updated><author><name>Tuan M Nguyen</name></author><author><name>Arghya Deb</name></author><author><name>Praveen Kokkonda</name></author><author><name>Vedagopuram Sreekanth</name></author><author><name>Praveen K Tiwari</name></author><author><name>Veronika M Shoba</name></author><author><name>Sophia Lai</name></author><author><name>Santosh K Chaudhary</name></author><author><name>Jaron A.M.

However, pomalidomide, a widely used E3 ligase recruiter in PROTACs, can independently degrade other targets, such as zinc-finger (ZF) proteins, that hold key functions in normal development and disease progression. This off-target degradation of pomalidomide-based PROTACs raises concerns about their therapeutic applicability and long-term side effects. Therefore, there is a crucial need to develop rules for PROTAC design that minimize off-target degradation. In this study, we developed a high-throughput platform that interrogates the off-target degradation of ZF domains and discovered, using this platform, that PROTACs with the current design paradigm induce significant degradation of several ZF proteins. To identify new rules for PROTAC design, we generated a rationalized library of pomalidomide analogs with distinct exit vector modifications on the C4 and C5 positions of the phthalimide ring and profiled their propensities for ZF protein degradation. We found that modifications on the C5 position with nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;Ar) reduce off-target ZF degradation. We applied our newfound design principles on a previously developed ALK oncoprotein-targeting PROTAC and generated PROTACs with enhanced potency and minimal off-target degradation. We envision the reported off-target profiling platform and pomalidomide analogs will find utility in the design of specific PROTACs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.18.468552" rel="alternate" title="Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras With Reduced Off-targets (35 tweets)"/><category term="Pharmacology and Toxicology"/><published>2021-11-20T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.19.21265383</id><title>GWAS defines pathogenic signaling pathways and prioritizes drug targets for IgA nephropathy (29 tweets)</title><updated>2021-11-22T12:05:39.916486+00:00</updated><author><name>Krzysztof Kiryluk</name></author><author><name>Elena Sanchez-Rodriguez</name></author><author><name>Xu-jie Zhou</name></author><author><name>Francesca Zanoni</name></author><author><name>Lili Liu</name></author><author><name>Nikol Mladkova</name></author><author><name>Atlas Khan</name></author><author><name>Maddalena Marasa</name></author><author><name>Jun-Ying Zhang</name></author><author><name>Olivia Balderes</name></author><author><name>Simone Sanna-Cherchi</name></author><author><name>Andrew S.

We performed a genome-wide association study involving 10,146 kidney biopsy-diagnosed IgAN cases and 28,751 matched controls across 17 international cohorts. We defined 30 independent genome-wide significant risk loci jointly explaining 11% of disease risk. A total of 16 loci were novel, including TNFSF4, REL, CD28, CXCL8/PF4V1, LY86, LYN, ANXA3, TNFSF8/15, REEP3, ZMIZ1, RELA, ETS1, IGH, IRF8, TNFRSF13B and FCAR. The SNP-based heritability of IgAN was estimated at 23%. We observed a positive genetic correlation between IgAN and total serum IgA levels, allergy, tonsillectomy, and several infections, and a negative correlation with inflammatory bowel disease. All significant non-HLA loci shared with serum IgA levels had a concordant effect on the risk of IgAN. Moreover, IgAN loci were globally enriched in gene orthologs causing abnormal IgA levels when genetically manipulated in mice. The explained heritability was enriched in the regulatory elements of cells from the immune and hematopoietic systems and intestinal mucosa, providing support for the pathogenic role of extra-renal tissues. The polygenic risk of IgAN was associated with early disease onset, increased lifetime risk of kidney failure, as well as hematuria and several other traits in a phenome-wide association study of 590,515 individuals. In the comprehensive functional annotation analysis of candidate causal genes across genome-wide significant loci, we observed the convergence of biological candidates on a common set of inflammatory signaling pathways and cytokine ligand-receptor pairs, prioritizing potential new drug targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.19.21265383" rel="alternate" title="GWAS defines pathogenic signaling pathways and prioritizes drug targets for IgA nephropathy (29 tweets)"/><category term="Genetic and Genomic Medicine"/><published>2021-11-20T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.17.469020</id><title>Effects of crude oil on juvenile threespine stickleback somatic and immune development (20 tweets)</title><updated>2021-11-22T12:05:39.918670+00:00</updated><author><name>Kelly S Ireland</name></author><author><name>Kathryn Milligan-Myhre</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Aquatic oil spills have resounding effects on surrounding ecosystems, and thus significant resources are committed to oil spill responses to remove the oil from the environment as quickly as possible. Oil has immunotoxic effects and may be particularly harmful to larval and juvenile fish as it can cause a number of developmental defects and stunt growth. In spite of significant efforts to clean oil, it is unclear whether larval and juvenile fish can recover from the effects of oil and no work has been done on the effect crude oil has on developing threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) fish. Threespine stickleback are a ubiquitous sentinel species in the northern hemisphere and are an important food source for many larger, economically valuable fish. As fish with fully marine, anadromous, and freshwater populations, stickleback are exposed to oil in a variety of aquatic environments. We hypothesized that oil exposure would suppress both growth and immunity of developing stickleback, but that fish health could be recovered by removal of the crude oil. Fish were exposed to Alaska North Slope crude oil and then were moved to water without crude oil for two weeks (depuration).  Measurements of growth and immunity were taken before and after the depuration. We found that crude oil effected different developmental pathways independently, significantly impacting some but not others. This is the first study to examine the effect crude oil has on early stages of stickleback development, and that stickleback fish are unable to recover from exposure after being transferred to clean water for two-weeks, suggesting larval/juvenile stickleback exposed to crude oil need longer than two-weeks to recover if they are able to recover at all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.17.469020" rel="alternate" title="Effects of crude oil on juvenile threespine stickleback somatic and immune development (20 tweets)"/><category term="Pharmacology and Toxicology"/><published>2021-11-19T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.14.21266221</id><title>Naloxone Buyers Club: Overlooked Critical Public Health Infrastructure for Preventing Overdose Deaths (11 tweets)</title><updated>2021-11-22T12:05:39.919205+00:00</updated><author><name>Maya Doe-Simkins</name></author><author><name>Eliza Jane Wheeler</name></author><author><name>Mary C.

Since 2012, the naloxone Buyers Club facilitated purchase of low-cost naloxone by harm reduction and syringe service programs, the primary conduits for reaching people who use drugs. This innovative purchasing and mutual aid network has not been previously described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed transactional records of naloxone orders (2017-2020, n=965), a survey of current Buyers Club members (2020, n=104), and mutual aid requests (2021, n=86).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2017 and 2020, annual orders for naloxone increased 2.6-fold. 114 unique harm reduction programs from 40 states placed orders for 3,714,110 vials of 0.4 mg/mL generic naloxone through the Buyers Club. States with most orders were: Arizona (600,000 vials), Illinois (576,800), Minnesota (347,450), California (317,200), North Carolina (315,040). Among programs that ordered naloxone in 2020, 52% (n=32) received no federal funding and ordered half as much as funded programs. During the 2021 shortage, mutual aid redistribution was common, with 80% participating as either a donor or recipient. Among 59 mutual aid requestors, 59% (n=35) were willing to accept expired naloxone; the clear preference was for generic injectable naloxone, 95% (n=56).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The naloxone Buyers Club is a critical element of overdose prevention infrastructure. Yet, barriers from corporate compliance officers and federal prescription-only status impede access. These barriers can be reduced by FDA removing the prescription requirement for naloxone and government funding for harm reduction programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.14.21266221" rel="alternate" title="Naloxone Buyers Club: Overlooked Critical Public Health Infrastructure for Preventing Overdose Deaths (11 tweets)"/><category term="Public and Global Health"/><published>2021-11-15T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.10.21266196</id><title>Development of an accessible gene expression bioinformatics pipeline to study driver mutations of colorectal cancer (8 tweets)</title><updated>2021-11-22T12:05:39.919560+00:00</updated><author><name>Lisa van den Driest</name></author><author><name>Caroline H Johnson</name></author><author><name>Nicholas JW Rattray</name></author><author><name>Zahra Rattray</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a global cause of cancer-related mortality driven by genetic and environmental factors which influence therapeutic outcomes.

Less is known about comorbid diabetes and hypertension and: cognitive and brain health in mid-life. We hypothesised that individuals with both diabetes and hypertension have worse cognitive and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used the UK Biobank cohort, a population-based study which recruited 500,000 individuals, aged 40-69 years. Type-2 diabetes was assigned using self-report, HbA1c and clinical data, while hypertension was defined based on self-report. Our outcomes included a breadth of brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters and cognitive function tests in a maximum of 38918 individuals. We tested associations in a cross sectional design firstly between those with diabetes (n = 2043) versus those without (reference category, n = 36875) then we tested associations between comorbid diabetes/hypertension (reference category, n=1283) and our outcomes by comparing this group with those with only diabetes (n=760), hypertension (n=9649) and neither disease (n=27226). Our analytical approach comprised linear regression models, with adjustment for a range of demographic and health factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with diabetes had worse overall brain health, as indexed by multiple neuroimaging parameters, with the exception of gFA (white matter integrity) and the amygdala. The largest difference was observed in the pallidum (β=0.179, 95%CI=0.137;0.220). Individuals with diabetes had poorer performance on certain cognitive tests, with the largest difference observed in the symbol digit substitution test (β=0.132, 95%CI=0.079;0.187). Compared to individuals with comorbid diabetes and hypertension, those with only hypertension had better brain health overall, with the largest difference observed in the pallidum (β=0.189, 95%CI=0.241;0.137), while those with only diabetes differed in total grey volume (β=0.150, 95%CI=0.122;0.179). Compared with individuals who had comorbid diabetes and hypertension, those with only diabetes performed distinctly better on the verbal and numeric reasoning task (β=0.129, 95%CI=0.077;0.261), whereas those with only hypertension performed better on the symbol digit substitution task (β=0.117, 95%CI=0.048;0.186)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions/interpretation&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with comorbid diabetes and hypertension have worse brain and cognitive health compared to those with only one of these diseases.

Two reviewers extracted data and appraised quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;26 studies of varied interventions using heterogeneous outcomes. Of ten interventions that strengthened health systems capacity to respond to VAW during routine SRH consultation, three reported no harm and reduction in some types of violence. Of nine interventions that strengthened health systems and communities’ capacity to respond to VAW, three reported conflicting effects on re-exposure to some types of VAW and mixed effect on SRH. The interventions increased identification of VAW but had no effect on the provision (75-100%) and uptake (0.6-53%) of referrals to VAW services. Of seven psychosocial interventions in addition to SRH consultation that strengthened women’s readiness to address VAW, four reduced re-exposure to some types of VAW and improved health. Factors that disrupted the pathway to better outcomes included accepting attitudes towards VAW, fear of consequences, and limited readiness of the society, health systems, and individuals. No study evaluated cost-effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conclusions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some VAW interventions in SRH services reduced re-exposure to some types of VAW and improved some health outcomes in single studies. Future interventions should strengthen capacity to address VAW across health systems, communities, and individual women.

Silverberg</name></author><content>&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Objective&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;The etiology of persistent memory complaints after concussion is poorly understood. Memory perfectionism (highly valuing memory ability and intolerance of minor memory lapses) may help explain why some people report persistent subjective memory problems in the absence of corresponding objective memory impairment. The present study investigated the relationship between memory perfectionism and persistent memory complaints after concussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Methods&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults (N=77; 61% women) with persistent symptoms following concussion were recruited from outpatient specialty clinics. Participants completed the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognition Battery, Test of Memory Malingering-Trial 1, and questionnaires measuring memory perfectionism (Memory in Adulthood-Achievement subscale), forgetfulness and other post-concussion symptoms (Rivermead Postconcussion Symptoms Questionnaire; RPQ), and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2) at M=17.8 weeks post-injury. Patients with vs. without severe memory complaints (based on the RPQ) were compared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Results&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory perfectionism was associated with severe memory complaint, after controlling for objective memory ability, overall cognitive ability, and depression (95% confidence interval for odds ratio = 1.11 to 1.40). Sensitivity analyses showed that this relationship did not depend on use of specific objective memory tests nor on inclusion of participants who failed performance validity testing. In a control comparison to test the specificity of identified relationships, memory perfectionism was not associated with severe fatigue (95% confidence interval for odds ratio = 0.91 to 1.07).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;&lt;sec&gt;&lt;title&gt;Discussion&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory perfectionism may predispose people to experience persistent memory symptoms and/or contribute to their perpetuation after concussion, with potential relevance to the spectrum of functional cognitive disorders more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sec&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.15.21266362" rel="alternate" title="Memory perfectionism is associated with persistent memory complaints after concussion (4 tweets)"/><category term="Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology"/><published>2021-11-16T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.19.469250</id><title>Preclinical and Toxicology Studies of BRD5529, a Selective Inhibitor of CARD9 (4 tweets)</title><updated>2021-11-22T12:05:39.920475+00:00</updated><author><name>Theodore Kottom</name></author><author><name>Kyle Schaefbauer</name></author><author><name>Eva M Carmona</name></author><author><name>Joanne E Yi</name></author><author><name>Andrew Limper</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Background: Exuberant inflammation during Pneumocystis pneumonia leads to lung injury. CARD9 is a central mediator of inflammatory signaling mediated by C-type lectin receptors. CARD9 inhibitor BRD5529 has been shown to be an effective in vitro inhibitor of Pneumocystis Beta-glucan-induced proinflammatory signaling and downstream TNF-alpha production, suggesting its viability as a candidate for preliminary drug testing as an anti-inflammatory agent in the rodent Pneumocystis pneumonia model (PCP).
Methods: To assess for potential toxicity, mice were injected intraperitoneally (IP) daily either with vehicle or BRD5529 at 0.1 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg for two weeks. Mouse weights were taken daily. At day 14, mice were euthanized, weighed, and analyzed by flexiVent for lung stiffness. Lungs, liver, and kidney were then harvested for H&amp;amp;E staining and pathology scoring. Lung samples were further analyzed for proinflammatory cytokines via ELISA and extracellular matrix generation via quantitative PCR (q-PCR). Blood collection postmortem was performed for blood chemistry analysis.
Results: BRD5529 at both doses of IP administration resulted in no significant changes in daily or final weight gain. Analysis of lung stiffness by flexiVent showed no significant differences between the control or treated groups. Furthermore, ELISA results for proinflammatory IL-1 Beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha showed no major differences in the respective groups. qPCR analysis of extracellular matrix transcripts collagen type I, alpha 1 (Col1a1) and fibronectin (Fn) were statically similar as well in the treated and control groups. Examination and pathology scoring of H&amp;amp;E slides from lung, liver, and kidney from the each of the mice in all groups and subsequent pathology scoring showed no significant change. Blood chemistry analysis revealed similar, non-significant patterns.
Conclusions: BRD5529 in our initial general safety and toxicology assessments displayed no inherent safety concerns in the analyzed parameters. These data support broader in vivo testing of the inhibitor as a timed adjunct therapy to the deleterious proinflammatory host immune response often associated with anti-Pneumocystis therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.19.469250" rel="alternate" title="Preclinical and Toxicology Studies of BRD5529, a Selective Inhibitor of CARD9 (4 tweets)"/><category term="Pharmacology and Toxicology"/><published>2021-11-19T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.20.21266571</id><title>Turning green: the impact of changing to more eco-friendly respiratory healthcare.

Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) have a substantially lower global warming potential than pressurized metered-dose inhalers (MDIs). To help mitigate climate change, we assessed the potential reduction in CO2-equivalents when replacing MDIs by DPIs in the Netherlands, and estimated the associated cost.
 
&lt;italic&gt;Design&lt;/italic&gt; 
We performed a four-step analysis based on data from two national databases of two independent governmental bodies (Dutch National Healthcare Institute and the Dutch Healthcare Authority). First, we calculated the number of patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and asthma that were using inhalation medication (2020). Second, we calculated the number and total of daily defined doses of MDIs, DPIs, and soft mist inhalers and the number of spacers per patients, dispensed by non-hospital based pharmacies  in 2020. Third, we estimated the potential reduction in CO2-equivalents (eq.) if all eligible patients (≥7 years old; COPD with ≤exacerbation per year) would switch from using MDIs to using DPIs as eco-friendly alternatives. Fourth, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis.

&lt;italic&gt;Results&lt;/italic&gt; 
In 2020, 1.4 million patients used inhalers for COPD or asthma treatment. A total of 460 million defined daily doses (DDDs) from inhalers were dispensed, of which, after the exclusion of nebulisers, 50.4% were from MDIs. We estimated that this use could be reduced by 70% leading to annual reduction in emissions of  77 - 84  million kg CO2eq. saving at best EUR 49.8 million annually.

&lt;italic&gt;Conclusions&lt;/italic&gt;
In the Netherlands, substitution of MDIs to DPIs for eligible patients is theoretically safe and in accordance with medical guidelines, while reducing emissions by 80 million kg.CO2eq. on average and saving at best EUR 49.8 million per year. This study confirms the potential climate and economic benefit of delivering eco-friendlier respiratory care.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.20.21266571" rel="alternate" title="Turning green: the impact of changing to more eco-friendly respiratory healthcare.

The databases including Medline (Ovid) 1946-, &lt;ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Embase.com"&gt;Embase.com&lt;/ext-link&gt; 1947-, CINAHL Plus 1937-, Scopus 1823-, Cochrane Library (including CENTRAL), and &lt;ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Clinicaltrials.gov"&gt;Clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/ext-link&gt;. were searched through October 2021 to extract published articles in English describing the relationship of parenchymal texture features with risk of breast cancer. Twenty-eight articles published since 2016 were included in the final review. Of these, 7 assessed texture features from film mammograms images, 3 did not report details of the image used, and the others used full field mammograms from Hologic, GE and other manufacturers. The identification of parenchymal texture features varied from using a predefined list to machine-driven identification. Reduction in number of features chosen for analysis in relation to cancer incidence then varied across statistical approaches and machine learning methods. The variation in approach and number of features identified for inclusion in analysis precluded generating a quantitative summary or meta-analysis of the value of these to improve predicting risk of future breast cancers. This updated overview of the state of the art revealed research gaps; based on these, we provide recommendations for future studies using parenchymal features for mammogram images to make use of accumulating image data, and external validation of prediction models that extend to 5 and 10 years to guide clinical risk management. By following these recommendations, we expect to improve risk classification and risk prediction for women to tailor screening and prevention strategies to level of risk.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.16.21266374" rel="alternate" title="Studies of parenchymal texture added to mammographic breast density and risk of breast cancer: a systematic review of the methods used in the literature (3 tweets)"/><category term="Epidemiology"/><published>2021-11-18T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.10.21266197</id><title>Multi-modal investigation of the schizophrenia-associated 3q29 genomic interval reveals global genetic diversity with unique haplotypes and segments that increase the risk for non-allelic homologous recombination (3 tweets)</title><updated>2021-11-22T12:05:39.920904+00:00</updated><author><name>Feyza Yilmaz</name></author><author><name>Umamaheswaran Gurusamy</name></author><author><name>Trenell J.

Mulle</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;Chromosomal rearrangements that alter the copy number of dosage-sensitive genes can result in genomic disorders, such as the 3q29 deletion syndrome. At the 3q29 region, non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between paralogous copies of segmental duplications (SDs) leads to a recurrent ∼1.6 Mbp deletion or duplication, causing neurodevelopmental and psychiatric phenotypes. However, risk factors contributing to NAHR at this locus are not well understood. In this study, we used an optical mapping approach to identify structural variations within the 3q29 interval. We identified 18 novel haplotypes among 161 unaffected individuals and used this information to characterize this region in 18 probands with either the 3q29 deletion or 3q29 duplication syndrome. A significant amount of variation in haplotype prevalence was observed between populations. Within probands, we narrowed down the breakpoints to a ∼5 kbp segment within the SD blocks in 89% of the 3q29 deletion and duplication cases studied. Furthermore, all 3q29 deletion and duplication cases could be categorized into one of five distinct classes based on their breakpoints. Contrary to previous findings for other recurrent deletion and duplication loci, there was no evidence for inversions in either parent of the probands mediating the deletion or duplication seen in this syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.10.21266197" rel="alternate" title="Multi-modal investigation of the schizophrenia-associated 3q29 genomic interval reveals global genetic diversity with unique haplotypes and segments that increase the risk for non-allelic homologous recombination (3 tweets)"/><category term="Genetic and Genomic Medicine"/><published>2021-11-15T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry></feed>
