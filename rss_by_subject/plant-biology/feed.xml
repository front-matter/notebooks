Connections to the root hair patterning and abundance (9 tweets)</title><updated>2021-08-02T05:56:32.821948+00:00</updated><author><name>Iva McCarthy-Suárez</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;A previous study (McCarthy-Suárez, 2021) showed that growing &lt;italic&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/italic&gt; seedlings for 5 days under excessive levels of gibberellins (GAs)/DELLAs altered the arrangement, shape and frequency of root hairs in root tips. Because no changes in the distribution or number of root hairs occurred when the gai-1 (gibberellin-insensitive-1) DELLA was over-expressed at the root epidermis, it was concluded that the GAs/DELLAs might regulate the root hair patterning and abundance in &lt;italic&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/italic&gt; seedlings by acting from the root sub-epidermal tissues. In the present study, microscopy analyses showed that excessive levels of GAs/DELLAs also modified the size and number of root tip cells in &lt;italic&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/italic&gt; seedlings. While excessive DELLAs shortened and widened the root epidermal, cortical, endodermal and pericycle cells, excessive GAs, excepting the epidermal cells, generally narrowed them. However, no changes of root cell size occurred when gai-1 was over-expressed at the root epidermis. In addition, high levels of DELLAs often induced extra cells at the root epidermis, cortex, endodermis and pericycle, whereas high levels of GAs sometimes induced extra cells at the root cortex and pericycle. On the other hand, excessive levels of DELLAs enhanced the outgrowth of lateral roots in root tips, unlike excessive levels of GAs. Thus, the results of this study suggest that supra-physiological levels of GAs/DELLAs might modify the size/number of root tip cells by acting from the root sub-epidermal tissues. This, in turn, might impact on the patterning and abundance of root hairs and on the root architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.453699" rel="alternate" title="Supra-physiological levels of gibberellins/DELLAs modify the root cell size/number and the root architecture in root tips of A. thaliana seedlings.

Although models for miRNA origination have been proposed based on sporadic cases, the genomic mechanisms driving swift diversification of the miRNA repertoires in plants remain elusive. Here, by comprehensively analyzing 20 phylogenetically representative plant species, we identified miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) as the predominant genomic sources for de novo miRNAs in angiosperms. Our data illustrated a transposition-transcription process whereby properly sized MITEs transposed into active genic regions could be converted into new miRNAs, termed MITE-miRNAs, in as few as 20 generations. We showed that this molecular domestication mechanism leads to a possible evolutionary arms race between the MITEs and the host genomes that rapidly and continuously changes the miRNA repertoires. We found that the MITE-miRNAs are selected for targeting genes associated with plant adaptation and habitat expansion, thereby constituting a genomic innovation potentially underlying angiosperm megadiversity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.25.453727" rel="alternate" title="Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements drive rapid microRNA diversification in angiosperms (9 tweets)"/><category term="Plant Biology"/><published>2021-07-26T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry></feed>
