Cancerous invadopodia and myelomonocytic podosomes are widely considered as structural tools facilitating these processes and are thus summarized under the term invadosomes. Despite similar behaviour on the individual scale, substantial differences have been reported to arise on the collective scale. They are considered to be a result of podosome mesoscale-connectivity. In this study, we investigated global in-plane and out-of-plane mechanical forces of podosome clusters in ER-Hoxb8 cell derived monocytes. We are able to correlate these forces with the interpodosomal connectivity. The observed traction and protrusion patterns fail to be explained by summation of single podosome mechanics. Instead, they appear to originate from superimposed mesoscale effects. Based on mechanistic and morphological similarities with epithelial monolayer mechanics, we propose a spatiotemporal model of podosome cluster mechanics capable of relating single to collective podosome mechanical behaviour. Our results suggest that network contraction-driven (in-plane) tractions lead to a buckling instability that contributes to the out-of-plane indentation into the substrate.  First assigning an active mechanical role to the dorsal podosome actomyosin network, we aim at translating actomyosin hierarchy into scale dependency of podosome mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.18.449040" rel="alternate" title="2.5D Tractions in monocytes reveal mesoscale mechanics of podosomes during substrate indenting cell protrusion (23 tweets)"/><category term="Biophysics"/><published>2021-06-18T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.19.448910</id><title>3D structure and in situ arrangements of CatSper channel in the sperm flagellum (9 tweets)</title><updated>2021-06-21T07:09:23.841441+00:00</updated><author><name>Yanhe Zhao</name></author><author><name>Huafeng Wang</name></author><author><name>Caroline Wiesehoefer</name></author><author><name>Naman B Shah</name></author><author><name>Evan Reetz</name></author><author><name>Jae Yeon Hwang</name></author><author><name>Xiaofang Huang</name></author><author><name>Polina V Lishko</name></author><author><name>Karen M Davies</name></author><author><name>Gunther Wennemuth</name></author><author><name>Daniela Nicastro</name></author><author><name>Jean-Ju Chung</name></author><content>&lt;p&gt;The sperm calcium channel CatSper plays a central role in successful fertilization as a primary Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; gateway into the sperm flagellum. However, the complex subunit composition of CatSper has impeded its reconstitution &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt; and structural elucidation. Here, we applied cryo-electron tomography to visualize the macromolecular organization of the native CatSper channel complex in intact mammalian sperm, as well as identified three additional CatSper-associated proteins. The repeating CatSper units form long zigzag-rows in four nanodomains along the flagella. In both mouse and human sperm, each CatSper repeat consists of a tetrameric pore complex. Murine CatSper contains an additional outwardly directed wing-structure connected to the tetrameric channel. The majority of the extracellular domains form a canopy above each pore-forming channel that interconnects to a zigzag-shaped roof. The intracellular domains link two neighboring channel complexes to a diagonal array. The loss of this intracellular link in &lt;italic&gt;Efcab9&lt;/italic&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; sperm distorts the longitudinally aligned zigzag pattern and compromises flagellar movement. This work offers unique insights into the mechanisms underlying the assembly and transport of the CatSper complex to generate the nanodomains and provides a long-sought structural basis for understanding CatSper function in the regulation of sperm motility.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.19.448910" rel="alternate" title="3D structure and in situ arrangements of CatSper channel in the sperm flagellum (9 tweets)"/><category term="Biophysics"/><published>2021-06-20T00:00:00+00:00</published></entry></feed>
