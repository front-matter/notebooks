Here we performed a direct comparison of two distinct routes of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, combined intratracheal/intranasal and small particle aerosol, in two nonhuman primate species: rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. While all four experimental groups displayed very few outward clinical signs, evidence of mild to moderate respiratory disease was present on radiographs and at the time of necropsy. Cynomolgus macaques exposed via the aerosol route also developed the most consistent fever responses and had the most severe respiratory disease and pathology. This study demonstrates that while all four models were suitable representations of mild COVID-like illness, aerosol exposure of cynomolgus macaques to SARS-CoV-2 produced the most severe disease, which may provide additional clinical endpoints for evaluating therapeutics and vaccines.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

We here distinguish between a ""dark taxon impediment"" caused by a large number of undescribed species and a ""superficial description impediment"" caused by species descriptions so imprecise that type specimens have to be consulted in order to resolve species identities. Recently, Sharkey et al. (2021) proposed to address the dark taxon impediment for Costa Rican braconid wasps by describing 403 species based on barcode clusters (""BINs"") computed by BOLD Systems. The default assumption of the revision is that BIN=Species (e.g., BOLD:ACM9419 becomes Bracon federicomatarritai Sharkey, sp. nov.) and therefore the diagnoses of most species consist only of a consensus barcode. We here argue that this type of ""minimalist revision"" is unnecessary and undesirable. It is unnecessary because barcode clusters (e.g. BINs) already provide grouping statements that overcome many of the obstacles associated with dark taxon impediments. However, minimalist revisions are also undesirable and problematic because the diagnoses are only based on one character system - that in the case of Sharkey et al. was poorly analyzed. Furthermore, the revision relies on units that violate basic rules of reproducibility because the BINs were delimited by a proprietary algorithm (RESL) that is applied to a mixture of public and private data. Here, we illustrate that many of the BINs described as species are unstable when the available public data are reanalyzed, reiterate that COI mostly measures time of divergence, and that BOLD Systems violates key principles of open science. We conclude by urging authors, reviewers, editors, and grantors to only publish and fund projects that adhere to modern standards of reproducibility.</jats:p>",2021-04-29

We assembled de novo the genome of a wild Betta splendens and whole-genome sequenced multiple individuals across five species within the B. splendens species complex, including wild populations and domesticated ornamental betta. Given our estimate of the mutation rate from pedigrees, our analyses suggest that betta were domesticated at least 1,000 years ago, centuries earlier than previously thought. Ornamental betta individuals have variable contributions from other Betta species and have also introgressed into wild populations of those species. We identify dmrt1 as the main sex determination gene in ornamental betta but not in wild B. splendens, and find evidence for recent directional selection at the X-allele of the locus. Furthermore, we find genes with signatures of recent, strong selection that have large effects on color in specific parts of the body, or the shape of individual fins, and are almost all unlinked. Our results demonstrate how simple genetic architectures paired with anatomical modularity can lead to vast phenotypic diversity generated during animal domestication, and set the stage for using betta as a modern system for evolutionary genetics.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

Starting from a continuum theory of macroscopic phase separation we derive a stochastic Langevin equation for molecular trajectories that takes into account thermal fluctuations. We find that molecular trajectories can be described as diffusion with drift in an effective potential, which has a steep gradient at phase boundaries. We discuss how the physics of phase coexistence affects the statistics of molecular trajectories and in particular the statistics of displacements of molecules crossing a phase boundary. At thermodynamic equilibrium detailed balance imposes that the distributions of displacements crossing the phase boundary from the dense or from the dilute phase are the same. Our theory can be used to infer key phase separation parameters from the statistics of single-molecule trajectories. For simple Brownian motion, there is no drift in the presence of a concentration gradient. We show that interactions in the fluid give rise to an average drift velocity in concentration gradients. Interestingly, under non-equilibrium conditions, single molecules tend to drift uphill the concentration gradient. Thus, our work bridges between single-molecule dynamics and collective dynamics at macroscopic scales and provides a framework to study single-molecule dynamics in phase-separating systems.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

The resulting nutrient limitation or restricted access to nutrients pose a major challenge for every organism. While many animals, such as hibernating animals, evolved strategies to overcome periods of nutrient scarcity, the cellular mechanisms of these strategies are poorly understood. Cave environments represent an extreme example of nutrient deprived environments since the lack of sunlight and therefore primary energy production drastically diminishes the nutrient availability. Here, we used Astyanax mexicanus, which includes river-dwelling surface fish and cave adapted cavefish populations to study the genetic adaptation to nutrient limitations. We show that cavefish populations store large amounts of fat in different body regions when fed ad libitum in the lab. We found higher expression of lipogenesis genes in cavefish livers when fed the same amount of food as surface fish, suggesting an improved ability of cavefish to use lipogenesis to convert available energy into triglycerides for storage into adipose tissue. Moreover, the lipid metabolism regulator, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (Pparγ), is upregulated at both transcript and protein levels in cavefish livers. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP seq) showed that Pparγ binds cavefish promoter regions of genes to a higher extent than surface fish. Finally, we identified two possible regulatory mechanisms of Pparγ in cavefish: higher amounts of ligands of the nuclear receptor, and nonsense mutations in per2, a known repressor of Pparγ.

In most countries, healthcare workers (HCWs) represent a priority group for vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to their elevated risk of COVID-19 and potential contribution to nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Concerns have been raised that HCWs from ethnic minority groups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant (defined by the World Health Organisation as refusing or delaying a vaccination) than those of White ethnicity, but there are limited data on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy and its predictors in UK HCWs.
Methods
Nationwide prospective cohort study and qualitative study in a multi-ethnic cohort of clinical and non-clinical UK HCWs. We analysed ethnic differences in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy adjusting for demographics, vaccine trust, and perceived risk of COVID-19. We explored reasons for hesitancy in qualitative data using a framework analysis. 
Findings
11,584 HCWs were included in the cohort analysis. 23% (2704) reported vaccine hesitancy. Compared to White British HCWs (21.3% hesitant), HCWs from Black Caribbean (54.2%), Mixed White and Black Caribbean (38.1%), Black African (34.4%), Chinese (33.1%), Pakistani (30.4%), and White Other (28.7%) ethnic groups were significantly more likely to be hesitant. In adjusted analysis, Black Caribbean (aOR 3.37, 95% CI 2.11 - 5.37), Black African (aOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.49 - 2.82), White Other ethnic groups (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.19 - 1.84) were significantly more likely to be hesitant. Other independent predictors of hesitancy were younger age, female sex, higher score on a COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs scale, lower trust in employer, lack of influenza vaccine uptake in the previous season, previous COVID-19, and pregnancy. Qualitative data from 99 participants identified the following contributors to hesitancy: lack of trust in government and employers, safety concerns due to the speed of vaccine development, lack of ethnic diversity in vaccine studies, and confusing and conflicting information. Participants felt uptake in ethnic minority communities might be improved through inclusive communication, involving HCWs in the vaccine rollout, and promoting vaccination through trusted networks.
Interpretation
Despite increased risk of COVID-19, HCWs from some ethnic minority groups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant than their White British colleagues. Strategies to build trust and dispel myths surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine in these communities are urgently required. Public health communications should be inclusive, non-stigmatising and utilise trusted networks.

Despite their critical roles in embryonic development, how universal epigenetic regulators coordinate these specific tasks from single locus to chromosome-scale remains understudied. Here, we systematically disrupted multiple essential epigenetic pathways within polymorphic F1 zygotes to examine postimplantation effects on canonical and non-canonical genomic imprinting as well as X chromosome inactivation. We find that DNA methylation and Polycomb group repressors are both indispensable for autosomal imprinting, albeit at distinct gene sets. Moreover, the extraembryonic ectoderm relies on a broader spectrum of unique imprinting mechanisms, including non-canonical targeting of maternal endogenous retrovirus (ERV) driven promoters by G9a. We further utilize our data to identify Polycomb dependent and independent gene clusters on the imprinted X chromosome, which appears to reflect distinct domains of Xist-mediated suppression. Our data has allowed us to assemble a comprehensive inventory of the epigenetic mechanisms utilized in eutherian mammals to maintain parent-specific imprinting, including an expanded view of the placental lineage that comprises multiple unique pathways.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

Transcriptomic analysis indicated inositol production is nonessential but its loss alters BT capsule expression. Bioinformatic and lipidomic comparisons of Bacteroidetes species revealed a novel second putative pathway for bacterial PI synthesis without a PIP intermediate. Our results indicate that inositol sphingolipid production, via one of the two pathways, is widespread in host-associated Bacteroidetes, and may be implicated in host interactions both indirectly via the capsule and directly through inositol lipid provisioning.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

To create a seasonal combination vaccine targeting influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 that is also amenable to frequent reformulation, we have developed a recombinant influenza A virus (IAV) genetic platform that reprograms the virus to package an immunogenic domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein onto IAV particles. Vaccination with this combination vaccine elicits neutralizing antibodies and provides protection from lethal challenge with both pathogens.

Inspired by neuroanatomical studies showing that feedforward and feedback connections in V1 terminate in different cortical layers, we hypothesized that this anatomical compartmentalization underlies functional segregation of external and internally-generated visual contents, respectively. We used high-resolution layer-specific fMRI to test this hypothesis in a mental rotation task. We found that rotated contents were predominant at outer cortical depth bins (i.e. superficial and deep). At the same time perceived contents were represented stronger at the middle cortical bin. These results identify how through cortical depth compartmentalization V1 functionally segregates rather than confuses external from internally-generated visual contents.

To develop and evaluate dedicated processing technics, high resolution RGB images were acquired from UAVs during several years and experiments over maize, sugar beet and sunflower crops at early stages. A total of 16247 plants have been labelled interactively. We compared the performances of handcrafted method (HC) to those of deep-learning (DL). HC method consists in segmenting the image into green and background pixels, identifying rows, then objects corresponding to plants thanks to knowledge of the sowing pattern as prior information. DL method is based on  the Faster RCNN model trained over 2/3 of the images selected to represent a good balance between plant development stage and sessions. One model is trained for each crop.
Results show that DL generally outperforms HC, particularly for maize and sunflower crops. The quality of images appears mandatory for HC methods where image blur and complex background induce difficulties for the segmentation step. Performances of DL methods are also limited by image quality as well as the presence of weeds. An hybrid method (HY) was proposed to eliminate weeds between the rows using the rules used for the HC method. HY improves slightly DL performances in the case of high weed infestation. A significant level of variability of plant detection performances is observed between the several experiments. This was explained by the variability of image acquisition conditions including illumination, plant development stage, background complexity and weed infestation. We tested an active learning approach where few images corresponding to the conditions of the testing dataset were complementing the training dataset for DL.

The bipolar interneurons of the mammalian retina represent a diverse neuronal class, characterized by distinct functions, morphologies, and recently discovered transcriptional profiles.

We found that bipolar subtype birthdates are ordered and follow a centrifugal developmental axis. Spatial analysis revealed a striking oscillatory wave pattern of bipolar subtype birthdates, and lineage analyses suggest clonal restriction on homotypic subtype production. These results inspired a hierarchical model of neuronal subtype genesis in the mammalian retina, with the wave pattern of subtype birthdates arising from early asymmetric cell divisions among founding retinal progenitor cells.

Phase I screening (August 2020) covered a total of 1305 individuals screened at major markets/lorry stations, major shopping malls, hospitals and research institutions involved in COVID-19 work. The screening was performed using a strip-in-cassette lateral flow type Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kit that simultaneously and separately detected IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. In Phase I, 252/1305 (19%) tested positive for IgM or IgG or both. Exposure rate was significantly higher among individuals tested at markets/lorry stations (26.9%) compared to those at Shopping Malls (9.4%). The 41–60-years age group had the highest exposure rate (27.2%). People with only a basic level or no formal education had a higher exposure rate (26.2%) than those with tertiary level education (13.1%); and higher in informally employed workers (24.0%) than those in the formal sector (15.0%). Phases II and III screening activities in October and December 2020, respectively, showed no evidence of increased seroprevalence, indicating either a reduced transmission rate or loss of antibody expression in a subset of the participants. The Upper East region has the lowest exposure rate, with only 4 of 200 participants (2%) seropositivity. Phase IV screening in February 2021 showed that exposure rates in the upper income earners (26.2%) had almost doubled since August 2020, reflective of Ghana’s second wave of symptomatic COVID-19 cases, which began in December 2020. The Phase IV results suggest that seroprevalence levels have become so high that the initial socioeconomic stratification of exposure has been lost. Overall, the data indicates a much higher COVID-19 seroprevalence in the Greater Accra Region than was officially acknowledged, likely implying a considerably lower case fatality rate than the current national figure of 0.84%. Additionally, the high exposure levels seen in the communities suggest that COVID-19 in Ghana still predominantly presents with none-to-mild symptoms. Our results lay the foundation for more extensive SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in Ghana and the West African sub-region, including deploying rapid antigen test kits in concert to determine the actual infection burden since antibody development lags infection.</jats:p>",2021-04-28

Advances in synthetic biology may help address these challenges by engineering biological systems to perform new functions such as biomanufacturing of high-value compounds from low-value waste streams and bioremediation of industrial pollutants. However, the current emphasis on microbial systems for biomanufacturing, which often require highly pre-processed inputs and sophisticated infrastructure, is not feasible for many waste streams. Meanwhile, concerns about transgene biocontainment have limited the release of engineered microbes or plants for bioremediation.
Engineering animals may provide opportunities for utilizing various waste streams that are not suitable for microbial biomanufacturing while effective transgene biocontainment options should enable in situ bioremediation. Here, we engineer the model insect Drosophila melanogaster to express a functional laccase from the fungus Trametes trogii. Laccase expressing flies reduced bisphenol A by more than 50% when present in their growth media, while a lyophilized powder made from engineered adult flies degraded more than 90% of bisphenol A and indigo carmine in aqueous solutions.

Due to its high sensitivity and specificity, RT-qPCR is the “gold standard” method for this purpose. However, its technical requirements, processing time and elevated costs hamper its use towards massive and timely molecular testing for COVID-19 in rural and socioeconomically deprived areas of Latin America. The advent and rapid evolution of CRISPR-Cas technology has boosted the development of new pathogen detection methodologies. Recently, DETECTR -a combination of isothermal RT-LAMP amplification and Cas12a-mediated enzymatic detection-has been successfully validated in the Netherlands and the USA as a rapid and low-cost alternative to RT-qPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Here, we evaluated the performance of RCSMS, a locally adapted variant of DETECTR, to ascertain the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples from 276 patients in two hospitals in Lima, Perú <jats:italic>(current status over a total of 350 samples</jats:italic>). We show that a low-cost thermochemical treatment with TCEP/EDTA is sufficient to inactivate viral particles and cellular nucleases in saliva, eliminating the need to extract viral RNA with commercial kits, as well as the cumbersome nasopharyngeal swab procedure and the requirement of biosafety level 2 laboratories for molecular analyses. Our clinical validation shows that RCSMS detects up to 5 viral copies per reaction in 40 min, with sensitivity and specificity of 93.8% and 99.0% in the field, respectively, relative to RT-qPCR. Since CRISPR-Cas biosensors can be easily reprogrammed by using different guide RNA molecules, RCSMS has the potential to be quickly adapted for the detection of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Notably, estimation of its negative and positive predictive values suggests that RCSMS can be confidently deployed in both high and low prevalence settings. Furthermore, our field study validates the use of lateral flow strips to easily visualize the presence of SARS-CoV-2, which paves the way to deploy RCSMS as a “point of care” test in environments with limited access to state-of-the-art diagnostic laboratories. In sum, RCSMS is a fast, efficient and inexpensive alternative to RT-qPCR for expanding COVID-19 testing capacity in low- and middle-income countries.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

Here we report the identification of RBPs that are broadly distributed across the Bacteroidetes, with many genomes encoding multiple copies. Genes encoding these RBPs are highly expressed in many <jats:italic>Bacteroides</jats:italic> species. A purified RBP, RbpB, from <jats:italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</jats:italic> binds to single-stranded RNA <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> with an affinity similar to other characterized regulatory RBPs. <jats:italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</jats:italic> mutants lacking RBPs show dramatic shifts in expression of polysaccharide utilization and capsular polysaccharide loci, suggesting that these RBPs may act as global regulators of polysaccharide metabolism.

However, the genetic circuitry governing C. auris morphology remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we developed an Agrobacterium­-mediated transformation system to generate mutants exhibiting aggregating or filamentous cell morphologies. Aggregating strains were associated with disruption of homologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chitinase and chitin synthase regulatory proteins, including components of the Regulation of ACE2 Morphogenesis (RAM) pathway, while disruption of a homolog of the S. cerevisiae ELM1 gene resulted in a novel filamentous strain of C. auris. To facilitate targeted genetic manipulation, we developed a transiently expressed Cas9 and sgRNA expression system for use in C. auris. Transformation using this system significantly increased the efficiency of homologous recombination and targeted integration of a reporter cassette in all four clades of C. auris. Using this system, we generated targeted deletion mutants to confirm the roles of RAM and Elm1 proteins in regulating C. auris morphogenesis. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into the genetic regulation of aggregating and filamentous morphogenesis in C. auris.

Multiple founders are crossed to create a rich mosaic of highly recombined founder genomes in the MAGIC recombinant inbred lines (RILs). Many variations of MAGIC population designs exist; however, a large proportion of the currently available populations have been created empirically and based on similar designs. In our evaluations of five MAGIC populations, we found that the choice of designs has a large impact on the recombination landscape in the RILs. The most popular design used in many MAGIC populations has been shown to have a bias in recombinant haplotypes and low level of unique recombinant haplotypes, and therefore is not recommended. To address this problem and provide a remedy for the future, we have developed the “magicdesign” R package for creating and testing any MAGIC population design via simulation. A Shiny app version of the package is available as well. Our “magicdesign” package provides a unifying tool and a framework for creativity and innovation in MAGIC population designs. For example, using this package, we demonstrate that MAGIC population designs can be found which are very effective in creating haplotype diversity without the requirement for very large crossing programmes. Further, we show that interspersing cycles of crossing with cycles of selfing is effective in increasing haplotype diversity.

Attenuation of ΔNS1 influenza viruses is due to their high IFN inducing properties, that limit their replication in vivo.

As an asymmetric homodimer undergoing an “alternating access” protomer-swap conformational change, it serves as a model for the mechanistic understanding of more complex drug transporters. Here, we present a free energy and solvent accessibility analysis that indicates the presence of two complementary ligand translocation pathways that remain operative in a broad range of conditions. Our simulations show a previously undescribed desolvated apo state and anticorrelated accessibility in the ligand-bound state, explaining on a structural level why EmrE does not disrupt the pH gradient through futile proton transfer. By comparing the behavior of a number of model charged and/or aromatic ligands, we also explain the origin of selectivity of EmrE towards a broad class of aromatic cations. Finally, we explore unbiased pathways of ligand entry and exit to identify correlated structural changes implicated in ligand binding and release, as well as characterize key intermediates of occupancy changes.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

Exposure to a novel environment rapidly initiated a dramatic increase in the rate, size and duration of beta bursts. Additionally, theta-beta cross-frequency coupling was significantly higher during novelty, and spiking of neurons in the RSC was significantly enhanced during beta bursts. Finally, aberrant beta bursting was seen in J20 mice, including increased beta bursting during novelty and familiarity, yet a loss of coupling between beta bursts and spiking activity. These findings, support the concept that beta bursting may be responsible for the activation and reactivation of neuronal ensembles underpinning the formation and maintenance of cortical representations, and that disruptions to this activity in J20 mice may underlie cognitive impairments seen in these animals.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

The members of the seed microbiome are the first to colonize a germinating seedling, and they initiate the trajectory of microbiome assembly for the next plant generation. Therefore, the members of the seed microbiome are important for the dynamics of plant microbiome assembly and the vertical transmission of potentially beneficial symbionts. However, it remains challenging to assess the microbiome at the individual seed level (and, therefore, for the future individual plant) due to low endophytic microbial biomass, seed exudates that can select for particular members, and high plant and plastid contamination of resulting reads. Here, we report a protocol for extracting metagenomic DNA from an individual seed (common bean, <jats:italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</jats:italic> L.) with minimal disruption of host tissue, which we expect to be generalizable to other medium-and large-seed plant species. We applied this protocol to quantify the 16S rRNA V4 and ITS2 amplicon composition and variability for individual seeds harvested from replicate common bean plants grown under standard, controlled conditions to maintain health. Using metagenomic DNA extractions from individual seeds, we compared seed-to-seed, pod-to-pod, and plant-to-plant microbiomes, and found highest microbiome variability at the plant level. This suggests that several seeds from the same plant could be pooled for microbiome assessment, given experimental designs that apply treatments at the maternal plant level.

While seizures are infrequent and unpredictable, IEDs are far more common, often occurring several times per minute. Yet despite the abundance of IEDs, it remains unknown how they relate to seizures. To better understand this relationship, we examined multi-day recordings of 96-channel microelectrode arrays implanted in human epilepsy patients. These recordings (spanning single cell action potentials to population field potentials) allowed us to study the microscale spatiotemporal organization of over 45,000 IEDs across 10 participants from 2 surgical centers. These recordings showed that the majority of IEDs propagate across neocortex as traveling waves. While all of these traveling wave distributions exhibited a predominant, consistent direction, the majority also exhibited a second, auxiliary, direction. Clustering the IED distributions revealed that their predominant and auxiliary distributions were antipodal, mimicking the spatial microstructure of seizure discharges (SDs) that we have previously reported. We thus compared spatial features of IED sub-distributions to those for SDs, showing a correspondence between ictal and interictal spatial properties in participants whose microelectrode arrays were recruited into the seizure from adjacent cortical tissue. These results reveal fundamental relationships between IEDs and seizures and suggest how IEDs could be used to infer spatial features of seizures.</jats:p>",2021-04-29

To better understand these strategies, we here investigate the active response of <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic> to changes in nutrient conditions, connecting transient gene-expression behavior to growth phenotypes. By synthetically modifying the gene expression during changing growth conditions, we show how the competition by genes for the limited protein synthesis capacity constrains the cellular response. Despite this constraint, cells substantially express genes that are not required, severely slowing down the response. These findings highlight that cells do not optimize growth and recovery in every encountered environment but rather exhibit hardwired response strategies that may have evolved to promote growth and fitness in their native environment and include the regulation of multiple genes. The constraint and the suboptimality of the cellular response uncovered in this study provides a conceptual framework relevant for many research applications, from the prediction of evolution and adaptation to the improvement of gene circuits in biotechnology.</jats:p>",2021-04-28

By changing the mechanical stiffness of the stator, we could accelerate or suppress the Brownian rotation within the mechanism, thereby demonstrating an allosteric coupling between the movement of the camshaft and of the stator, and the ability to tailor the free energy landscape that governs the rotary motion.

Loss of DNA methylation is associated with disease, including cancer, but is also required for development.

Here, we find that DAXX, an H3.3 chaperone, protects pericentromeric heterochromatin and is essential for embryonic stem cells (ESCs) maintenance in the ground-state of pluripotency. Upon DNA demethylation-mediated damage, DAXX relocalizes to pericentromeric regions, and recruits PML and SETDB1, thereby promoting heterochromatin formation. In the absence of DAXX, the 3D-architecture and physical properties of pericentric heterochromatin are disrupted, resulting in derepression of major satellite DNA. Using epigenome editing tools, we demonstrate that H3.3, and specifically H3.3K9 modification, directly contribute to maintaining pericentromeric chromatin conformation.

Hierarchical Bayesian (HB) calibration provides a third option that frees modelers from assuming model parameters to be completely generic or completely site-specific and allows a formal distinction between prediction at known calibration sites and out-of-sample prediction to new sites. Here, we compare calibrations of a process-based dynamic vegetation model to eddy-covariance data across 12 temperate deciduous Ameriflux sites fit using either site-specific, joint cross-site, or HB approaches. To be able to apply HB to computationally demanding process-based models we introduce a novel emulator-based HB calibration tool, which we make available through the PEcAn community cyberinfrastructure. Using these calibrations to make predictions at held-out tower sites, we show that the joint cross-site calibration is falsely over-confident due to more information fed into the calibration. By showing which parameters show high site-to-site variability, HB calibration also formally gives us a structure that can detect which process representations are missing from the models and prioritize errors based on the magnitude of the associated uncertainty.

Moving forward, HB approaches present important new opportunities for statistical modeling of the spatiotemporal variability in modeled parameters and processes that yields both new insights and improved predictions.</jats:p>",2021-04-29

Using this unique set of individuals, we monitored variations in their blood cell populations, plasma metabolites and faecal microbiota over a grazing season to isolate core differences between their respective responses under worm-free or natural infection conditions.

The molecular mechanism underlying TBK1 activation by STING remains poorly understood. Here we report a cell system by which STING and TBK1 are simultaneously monitored. The system utilizes STING/TBK1-double knockout (KO) cells, fluorescent protein-tagged TBK1 and STING, and super-resolution microscopy. After STING stimulation, TBK1 is directly recruited to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), not to the other parts of the Golgi. The recruitment of TBK1 does not require its kinase activity. C-terminal STING variants (ΔC9 and L373A), in which the TBK1-STING binding interface is mutated or deleted, induce the recruitment of TBK1.

The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) are two key nodes in the circuitry supporting such outcome guided behavior, but very little is known about the function of direct connections between these regions. Here, in male rats, we first anatomically confirmed the existence of bidirectional, direct projections between the mOFC and BLA and found that BLA projections to mOFC are distinct from those to lateral OFC (lOFC). Next, using pathway-specific chemogenetic inhibition and the outcome-selective Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer and devaluation tests, we interrogated the function of the bidirectional mOFC→BLA connections in reward-directed behavior. We found evidence that the mOFC→BLA pathway mediates the use of environmental cues to predict which reward is available, information needed to infer which action to choose, and how desirable that reward is to ensure adaptive cue responses. By contrast, the BLA→mOFC pathway is not needed to use cues to know which reward is available but is needed to use the current desirability of that reward to infer how advantageous it would be to respond to the cue. These functions differ from those we previously identified for the lOFC-BLA circuit.

Methods: Baseline and daily indicators were evaluated using electronic health records for 46,971 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from 176 HCA Healthcare-affiliated hospitals, presenting from March to September 2020, to develop a real-time risk model (RTRM) of all-cause, hospitalized mortality. Patient facility, dates-of-care, clinico-demographics, comorbidities, vitals, laboratory markers, and respiratory support findings were aggregated in a logistic regression model.

Findings: The RTRM predicted overall mortality as well as mortality 1, 3, and 7 days in advance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC) of 0.905, 0.911, 0.905, and 0.901 respectively, significantly outperforming a combined model of age and daily modified WHO progression scale (all p&lt;0.0001; AUCROC, 0.846, 0.848, 0.850, and 0.852). The RTRM delineated risk at presentation from ongoing risk associated with medical care and showed that mortality rates decreased over time due to both decreased severity and changes in care.

Interpretation: To our knowledge, this study is the largest of its kind to comprehensively evaluate predictors and incorporate daily risk measures of COVID-19 mortality. The RTRM validates current literature trends in mortality across time and allows direct translation for research and clinical applications.</jats:p>",2021-04-28

Attempts to model the RP as an accumulation-to-bound process suggest that this signal is a by-product of time-locking to crests in neural noise rather than the outcome of a pre-conscious decision to initiate a movement. One parameter of the model accounts for the imperative to move now, with cued movements having a strong imperative and purely spontaneous movements having no imperative. Two different variants of the model have been proposed, and both predict a decrease in the (negative) amplitude of the early RP as the imperative grows stronger. In order to test this empirically, we conducted an experiment where subjects produced self-initiated movements under varying levels of time pressure, and we investigated the amplitude, shape, and latency of the RP as a function of the imperative to move, operationalized as a time limit.

The neural network that predicts the cell proportion in a pseudospot, a virtual mixture of cells from single-cell data, is translated to decompose the cell types in each spatial barcoded region. First, CellDART was applied to mouse brain and human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue to identify cell types with a layer-specific spatial distribution. Overall, the suggested approach was superior to the other computational methods in predicting the spatial localization of excitatory neurons. Furthermore, CellDART elucidated the cell type predominance defined by the human lung cell atlas across the lung tissue compartments and it corresponded to the known prevalent cell types.

How and why this repeatability occurs remains a central question in evolutionary biology, but the complexity of most traits makes it challenging to answer. Reptiles and mammals independently evolved oral venoms that consist of proteinaceous cocktails which allow straightforward mapping between genotype and phenotype. Although biochemically similar toxins can occur as major venom components across many taxa, whether these toxins evolved via convergent or parallel means remains unknown. Most notable among them are kallikrein-like serine proteins, which form the core of most vertebrate venoms, and are employed by all venomous snake families. Here we used a combination of comparative genomics and phylogenetics to investigate whether serine protease recruitment into the venom occurred independently or in parallel across the different tetrapod lineages. Using syntenic relationships between genes flanking known toxins, we traced the origin of kallikreins to a single locus containing one or more nearby paralogous kallikrein-like clusters. Independently, phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate serine proteases revealed that the same gene cluster gave rise to toxins in mammals and reptiles. Given the shared regulatory and genetic machinery underlying venom evolution, these findings suggest a unified model underlying vertebrate venom evolution by exaptation of homologous ancestral kallikreins. Furthermore, the ubiquitous distribution of kallikreins across vertebrates suggests that the evolution of envenomation may be more common than previously recognized, blurring the line between venomous and non-venomous animals.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

We show that ATCC927 forms pellicle-type (PBFs) and submerged-type (SBFs) biofilms after two weeks and two days of growth, respectively, and that the increased CelA1 synthesis in this strain prevents biofilm formation and leads to reduced rifampicin tolerance. The proteomic data suggests that specific changes in mycolic acid synthesis (cord factor), Esx1-secretion, and cell-wall adhesins explain the appearance of PBFs as ribbon-like cords and SBFs as lichen-like structures. A subpopulation of cells resisting the 64 × MIC rifampicin (persisters) were detected in both biofilm subtypes, and already in one-week-old SBFs. The key forces boosting their development could include subtype-dependent changes in asymmetric cell division, cell wall biogenesis, tricarboxylic acid/glyoxylate cycle activities, and energy/redox/iron metabolisms. The effect of varying ambient oxygen tensions on each cell type and non-classical protein secretion are likely factors explaining majority of the subtype-specific changes. The proteomic findings also imply that Esx1-type protein secretion is more efficient in PL and PBF cells, while SBF may prefer both the Esx5- and non-classical pathways to control virulence and prolonged viability/persistence.

In Brazil, this mitigation strategy was first implemented in March 2020 and mainly monitored by social isolation indicators built from mobile geolocation data. While it is well known that social isolation has been playing a crucial role in epidemic control, the precise connections between mobility data indicators and epidemic dynamic parameters have a complex interdependence. In this work, we investigate this dependence for several Brazilian cities, looking also at socioeconomic and demographic factors that influence it. As expected, the increase in the social isolation indicator was shown to be related to the decrease in the speed of transmission of the disease, but the relation was shown to depend on the urban hierarchy level of the city, the human development index and also the epidemic curve stage. Moreover, a high social isolation at the beginning of the epidemic relates to a strong positive impact on flattening the epidemic curve, while less efficacy of this mitigation strategy was observed when it has been implemented later. Mobility data plays an important role in epidemiological modeling and decision-making, however, we discuss in this work how a direct relationship between social isolation data and COVID-19 data is hard to be established. Understanding this interplay is a key factor to better modeling, for which we hope this study contributes.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

How somatic signals and germ cell-intrinsic cues act together to regulate germline sex determination is a key question about which little is known. We have found that JAK/STAT signaling in the GSC niche promotes male identity in germ cells and GSCs, in part by activating expression of the epigenetic reader Phf7. We have also found that JAK/STAT signaling is blocked in XX (female) germ cells through the intrinsic action of the sex determination gene Sex lethal, which preserves female identity.

They are clinically validated and thus represent a true alternative to classical immunoglobulin formats. In contrast to immunoglobulins, they are built from solenoid protein domains comprising an N-terminal capping repeat, one or more internal repeats and a C-terminal capping repeat. By using <jats:italic>in silico</jats:italic> analysis and a rationally guided Ala-Scan, we identified position 17 of the N-terminal capping repeat to play a key role for the overall protein thermostability. The melting temperature of a DARPin domain with a single full-consensus internal repeat was increased by about 8°C to 10°C when the original Asp17 was replaced by Leu, Val, Ile, Met, Ala or Thr, as shown by high-temperature unfolding experiments at equilibrium. We then transferred the Asp17Leu mutation to various backgrounds, including different N- and C-terminal capping repeats and clinically validated DARPin domains, such as the VEGF-binding ankyrin repeat domain of abicipar pegol. In all cases, the proteins remained monomeric and showed improvements in the thermostability of about 8°C to 16°C. Thus, the replacement of Asp17 seems to be generically applicable to this drug class. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the Asp17Leu mutation reduces electrostatic repulsion and improves van-der-Waals packing, rendering the DARPin domain less flexible and more stable. Interestingly, such a beneficial Asp17Leu mutation is present in the N-terminal caps of three of the five DARPin domains of ensovibep, a SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor currently in clinical development. This mutation is likely responsible, at least in part, for the very high melting temperature (&gt;90°C) of this promising anti-Covid-19 drug. Overall, such N-terminal capping repeats with increased thermostability seem to be beneficial for the development of innovative drugs based on DARPins.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

Specifically, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of fetal bone marrow HSPCs showed that maternal WSD altered the transcriptional program of the common lymphoid progenitors and decreased the frequencies of bone marrow B-cells and NK-cells. Despite an expansion of monocyte progenitors in FBM, fetal blood monocytes from the WSD group demonstrated a blunted response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide.

In this study, we observed a significant shift (p = 0.015) of the 47 identified putative <jats:italic>Pseudomonas</jats:italic> phages with a minimum 2-fold change above 0 in read abundance when adding a <jats:italic>Pseudomonas syringae</jats:italic> DC3000 host. Surprisingly, it appears that only two out of five plaque-forming phages from the same organic waste sample, targeting the <jats:italic>Pseudomonas</jats:italic> strain, was highly abundant in the metavirome, while the other three were almost absent despite host exposure. Lastly, our sequencing results highlights how long reads from Oxford Nanopore elevates the assembly quality of metaviromes, compared to short reads alone.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

The extent of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and transmission in Mali and the surrounding region is not well understood, although infection has been confirmed in nearly 14,000 symptomatic individuals and their contacts since the first case in March 2020. We aimed to estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in three Malian communities, and understand factors associated with infection. 

Methods
Between 27 July 2020 and 29 January 2021, we collected blood samples along with demographic, social, medical and self-reported symptoms information from residents aged 6 months and older in three study communities at two study visits. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured using a highly specific two-antigen ELISA optimized for use in Mali. We calculated cumulative adjusted seroprevalence for each site and evaluated factors associated with serostatus at each visit by univariate and multivariate analysis.

Findings
Overall, 94.8% (2533/2672) of participants completed both study visits. A total of 50.3% (1343/2672) of participants were male, and 31.3% (837/2672) were aged &lt;10 years, 27.6% (737/2672) were aged 10-17 years, and 41.1% (1098/2572) were aged &gt;/=18 years. The cumulative SARS-CoV-2 exposure rate was 58.5% (95% CI: 47.5 to 69.4). This varied between sites and was 73.4% (95% CI: 59.2 to 87.5) in the urban community of Sotuba, 53.2% (95% CI: 42.8 to 63.6) in the rural town of Bancoumana, and 37.1% (95% CI: 29.6 to 44.5) in the rural village of Doneguebougou. This equates to an infection rate of approximately 1% of the population every three days in the study communities between visits. Increased age and study site were associated with serostatus at both study visits. There was minimal difference in reported symptoms based on serostatus. 

Interpretation
The true extent of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in Mali is greater than previously reported and now approaches hypothetical herd immunity in urban areas. The epidemiology of the pandemic in the region may be primarily subclinical and within background illness rates. In this setting, ongoing surveillance and augmentation of diagnostics to characterize locally circulating variants will be critical to implement effective mitigation strategies like vaccines.

GABA is known to play a key and conserved role in sleep control, and GABAergic tone should therefore be tightly controlled in sleep circuits.  Here we examined the role of the astrocytic GABA transporter (GAT) in sleep regulation using Drosophila melanogaster. We found that a hypomorphic gat mutation (gat33-1) increased sleep amount, decreased sleep latency, and increased sleep consolidation. Interestingly, sleep defects were suppressed when gat33-1 was combined with a mutation disrupting wide-awake (wake), a gene that regulates the cell-surface levels of the GABAA receptor Resistance to Dieldrin (RDL) in the wake-promoting large ventral lateral neurons (l-LNvs). Moreover, RNAi knockdown of rdl and its modulator dnlg4 in these circadian neurons also suppressed gat33-1 sleep phenotypes.  Brain immunohistochemistry showed that GAT-expressing astrocytes were located near RDL-positive l-LNvs cell bodies and dendritic processes. We conclude that astrocytic GAT decreases GABAergic tone and RDL activation in arousal promoting LNvs, thus determining proper sleep amount and quality in Drosophila</jats:p>",2021-04-27

Stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini) are a diverse clade of social bees (&gt;500 species) with a pantropical distribution spanning South and Central America, Africa, India and Austral-Asia. They are garnering increasing attention as commercially-beneficial pollinators of some crops, yet their contribution to the pollination of native plants in the tropics and subtropics remains poorly understood. Here we conduct for the first time a global review of the plants visited by stingless bees. We compile a database of reported associations (flower visits) between stingless bees and plants, from studies that have made either direct observations of foraging bees or analysed the pollen stored in nests. Worldwide, we find stingless bees have been reported to visit the flowers of plants from at least 215 different families and 1434 genera, with frequently reported interactions for many of the tropic’s most species-diverse plant families including Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Rubiaceae, Poaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Myrtaceae, Malvaceae, Arecaceae, Solanaceae, and Anacardiaceae. The stingless bee fauna of each of three major biogeographic regions (Neotropical, Afrotropical and Indo-Malayan-Australasian) were frequent visitors of many of the same plant families, however we detected differences in the proportional use of plant families by the stingless bees of the Indo-Malayan-Australasian and Neotropical regions, likely reflecting differences in the available flora of those regions. Stingless bees in all regions visit a range of exotic species in their preferred plant families (crops, ornamental plants and weeds), in addition to native plants. Although most reports of floral visitation on wild plants do not confirm effective pollen transfer, it is likely that stingless bees make at least some contribution to pollination for the majority of plants they visit. In all, our database supports the view that stingless bees play an important role in the ecosystems of the global tropics and subtropics as pollinators of an exceptionally large and diverse number of plants. This database also highlights important gaps in our knowledge of stingless bee resource use and should benefit future efforts to understand stingless bee-plant interactions.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

Although many genes express NMD-sensitive transcripts, identifying them based on short-read sequencing data remains a challenge. Results: To identify and analyze endogenous targets of NMD, we applied cDNA Nanopore sequencing and short-read sequencing to human cells with varying expression levels of NMD factors. Our approach detects full-length NMD substrates that are highly unstable and increase in levels or even only appear when NMD is inhibited. Among the many new NMD-targeted isoforms that our analysis identified, most derive from alternative exon usage. The isoform-aware analysis revealed many genes with significant changes in splicing but no significant changes in overall expression levels upon NMD knockdown. NMD-sensitive mRNAs have more exons in the 3΄UTR and, for those mRNAs with a termination codon in the last exon, the length of the 3΄UTR per se does not correlate with NMD sensitivity. Analysis of splicing signals reveals isoforms where NMD has been co-opted in the regulation of gene expression,  though the main function of NMD still seems to be ridding the transcriptome of isoforms resulting from spurious splicing events. Conclusions: Long-read sequencing enabled the identification of many novel NMD-sensitive mRNAs and revealed both known and unexpected features concerning their biogenesis and their biological role. Our data provide a highly valuable resource of human NMD transcript targets for future genomic and transcriptomic applications.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

The diarrhea does not appear to account for the disease mortality and its contribution to the morbidity has not been defined, even though it is a component of Long Covid or post-infectious aspects of the disease.  Even less is known about the pathophysiologic mechanism of the diarrhea.  To begin to understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19 diarrhea, we exposed human enteroid monolayers obtained from  five healthy subjects and made from duodenum, jejunum, and proximal colon to live SARS-CoV-2 and virus like particles (VLPs) made from exosomes expressing SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane and Envelope).  Results: 1)  Live virus was exposed apically for 90 min, then washed out and studied 2 and 5 days later.   SARS-Cov-2 was taken up by enteroids and live virus was present in lysates and in the apical&gt;&gt;basolateral media of polarized enteroids 48 h after exposure.  This is the first demonstration of basolateral appearance of live virus after apical exposure.  High vRNA concentration was detected in cell lysates and in the apical and basolateral media up to 5 days after exposure.  2 ) Two days after viral exposure, cytokine measurements of media showed significantly increased levels of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1.  3)  Two days after viral exposure, mRNA levels of ACE2, NHE3 and DRA were reduced but there was no change in mRNA of CFTR.  NHE3 protein was also decreased.  4) Live viral studies were mimicked by some studies with VLP exposure for 48 h. VLPs with Spike- D614G bound to the enteroid apical surface and was taken up; this resulted in decreased mRNA levels of ACE2, NHE3, DRA and CFTR. 4) VLP effects were determined on active anion secretion measured with the Ussing chamber/voltage clamp technique.   S-D614G acutely exposed to apical surface of human ileal enteroids did not alter the short-circuit current (Isc).  However, VLPS- D614G   exposure to enteroids that were pretreated for ~24 h with  IL-6 plus IL-8 induced a concentration dependent increase in Isc indicating stimulated anion secretion, that was delayed in onset by ~8 min .  The anion secretion was inhibited by  apical exposure to a specific calcium activated Cl channel (CaCC) inhibitor (AO1) but not by a specific CFTR inhibitor (BP027); was inhibited by basolateral exposure to the K channel inhibit clortimazole; and was prevented by pretreatment with the calcium buffer BAPTA-AM. 5) The calcium dependence of the VLP-induced increase in Isc was studied in Caco- 2/BBe cells stably expressing the genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor GCaMP6s.  24 h pretreatment with IL-6/IL-8 did not alter intracellular Ca2+.  However, in IL-6/IL-8 pretreated cells, VLP S-D614G caused appearance of Ca2+waves and an overall increase in intracellular Ca2+ with a delay of ~10 min after VLP addition.  We conclude that the diarrhea of COVID-19 appears to an example of a calcium dependent inflammatory diarrhea that involves both acutely stimulated  Ca2+ dependent anion secretion (stimulated Isc) that involves CaCC and likely inhibition of neutral NaCl absorption (decreased NHE3 protein and mRNA and decreased DRA mRNA).</jats:p>",2021-04-28

Current models for quantitatively describing the temperature response include simple but empirical equations (such as Arrhenius’) or models derived from first principles which are often overly complicated (i.e. with many parameters). Moreover, their theoretical framework does not include how parameters vary, nor their applicability across multiple scales and taxa, or whether they exhibit universality [1-7].

To cope with this challenge, males apply various behavioral and physiological strategies to maximize their paternity rates. Previous studies in Drosophila melanogaster established a link between the composition of the social environment and the reproductive success of individual male flies. While most studies until now focused on the adaptive responses of male flies to the presence of rival males, little is known about whether the outcomes of sexual interactions with female partners affect male-male social interactions in a competitive environment such as the social group. Here we show that repeated failures to mate promote a coordinated physiological and behavioral responses that can serve to increase paternity chances over mating rivals. We exposed male flies to sexual deprivation or successful mating and analyzed the behavioral repertoires of individuals within groups and the structure of their emerging social networks. We discovered that failures to mate and successful mating generate distinct emergent group interactions and structures, where sexually deprived males form low density social networks and actively minimize their encounters with other group members, while increasing their aggressive behavior.  In addition, sexually deprived male flies elevate the production of seminal fluid proteins (known to facilitate post-mating responses in females) and extend mating duration upon mating with receptive females, altogether leading to reduced re-mating rates. Our results demonstrate the existence of a flexible mating strategy that may provide a short-term fitness advantage over competing rivals and pave the path for using simple model organisms to dissect the neurobiology of social plasticity as coping strategy to living in a highly dynamic environment as the social domain.</jats:p>",2021-04-28

We identified 9,151 colocalized genes for 1,411 phenotypes across 48 tissues. Then, we constructed a bipartite network using the colocalized signals to establish links between genes and phenotypes in each tissue. The majority of links are observed in a single tissue whereas only a few are present in all tissues. Finally, we applied the biLouvain clustering algorithm in each tissue-specific bipartite network to identify co-clusters of non-overlapping genes and phenotypes. The majority of co-clusters contains a small number of genes and phenotypes, and 88.6% of co-clusters are found in only one tissue. To demonstrate functionality of the phenome-wide map, we tested if these co-clusters were enriched with known biological and functional gene classes and observed several significant enrichments.

In insects the number of eggs that an ovary can produce is a major determinant of reproductive capacity. Insect ovaries are made up of tubular egg-producing subunits called ovarioles, whose number largely determines the number of eggs that can be potentially laid. Ovariole number is directly determined by the number of cellular structures called terminal filaments, which are stacks of cells that assemble in the larval ovary. Elucidating the developmental and regulatory mechanisms of terminal filament formation is thus key to understanding the regulation of insect reproduction through ovariole number regulation. We systematically measured mRNA expression of all cells in the larval ovary at the beginning, middle and end of terminal filament formation. We also separated somatic and germ line cells during these stages and assessed their tissue-specific gene expression during larval ovary development. We found that the number of differentially expressed somatic genes is highest during late stages of terminal filament formation and includes many signaling pathways that govern ovary development. We also show that germ line tissue, in contrast, shows greater differential expression during early stages of terminal filament formation, and highly expressed germ line genes at these stages largely control cell division and DNA repair. We provide a tissue-specific and temporal transcriptomic dataset of gene expression in the developing larval ovary as a resource to study insect reproduction.</jats:p>",2021-04-28

There is a substantial amount of historical and modern primary and secondary literature about the spatial and temporal extent of epidemics, circumstances of transmission or symptoms and treatments. Many quantitative analyses rely on structured data, but the extraction of specific information such as the time and place of outbreaks is a tedious process. Machine learning algorithms for natural language processing (NLP) can potentially facilitate the establishment of datasets, but their use in plague research has not been explored much yet. We investigated the performance of five pre-trained NLP libraries (Google NLP, Stanford CoreNLP, spaCy, germaNER and Geoparser.io) for the extraction of location data from a German plague treatise published in 1908 compared to the gold standard of manual annotation. Of all tested algorithms, we found that Stanford CoreNLP had the best overall performance but spaCy showed the highest sensitivity. Moreover, we demonstrate how word associations can be extracted and displayed with simple text mining techniques in order to gain a quick insight into salient topics. Finally, we compared our newly digitised plague dataset to a re-digitised version of the famous Biraben plague list and update the spatio-temporal extent of the second pandemic plague mentions. We conclude that all NLP tools have their limitations, but they are potentially useful to accelerate the collection of data and the generation of a global plague outbreak database.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

We set out to establish a system-wide profile of the KRAS-regulated kinase signaling network (kinome) in KRAS-mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We knocked down KRAS expression in a panel of six cell lines, and then applied Multiplexed Inhibitor Bead/Mass Spectrometry (MIB/MS) chemical proteomics to monitor changes in kinase activity and/or expression. We hypothesized that depletion of KRAS would result in downregulation of kinases required for KRAS-mediated transforming activities, and in upregulation of other kinases that could potentially compensate for the deleterious consequences of the loss of KRAS. We identified 15 upregulated and 13 downregulated kinases in common across the panel. In agreement with our hypothesis, all 15 of the upregulated kinases have established roles as cancer drivers (e.g., SRC, TGFBR1, ILK), and pharmacologic inhibition of the upregulated kinase, DDR1, suppressed PDAC growth. Interestingly, 11 of the 13 downregulated kinases have established driver roles in cell cycle progression, particularly in mitosis (e.g., WEE1, Aurora A, PLK1). Consistent with a crucial role for the downregulated kinases in promoting KRAS-driven proliferation, we found that pharmacologic inhibition of WEE1 also suppressed PDAC growth. The unexpected paradoxical activation of ERK upon WEE1 inhibition led us to inhibit both WEE1 and ERK concurrently, which caused further potent growth suppression and enhanced apoptotic death than WEE1 inhibition alone. We conclude that system-wide delineation of the KRAS-regulated kinome can identify potential therapeutic targets for KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer.</jats:p>",2021-04-30
