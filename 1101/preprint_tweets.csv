We assembled de novo the genome of a wild Betta splendens and whole-genome sequenced multiple individuals across five species within the B. splendens species complex, including wild populations and domesticated ornamental betta. Given our estimate of the mutation rate from pedigrees, our analyses suggest that betta were domesticated at least 1,000 years ago, centuries earlier than previously thought. Ornamental betta individuals have variable contributions from other Betta species and have also introgressed into wild populations of those species. We identify dmrt1 as the main sex determination gene in ornamental betta but not in wild B. splendens, and find evidence for recent directional selection at the X-allele of the locus. Furthermore, we find genes with signatures of recent, strong selection that have large effects on color in specific parts of the body, or the shape of individual fins, and are almost all unlinked. Our results demonstrate how simple genetic architectures paired with anatomical modularity can lead to vast phenotypic diversity generated during animal domestication, and set the stage for using betta as a modern system for evolutionary genetics.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

Here, we show that aminoglycosides, a well-known class of antibiotics produced by <jats:italic>Streptomyces</jats:italic>, are potent inhibitors of phage infection in widely divergent bacterial hosts. We demonstrate that aminoglycosides block an early step of the viral life cycle, prior to genome replication. Phage inhibition was also achieved using supernatants from natural aminoglycoside producers, hinting at a broad physiological significance of the antiviral properties of aminoglycosides. Strikingly, we show that acetylation of the aminoglycoside antibiotic apramycin abolishes its antibacterial effect, but retains its antiviral properties. Altogether, this study expands the knowledge of potential aminoglycoside functions in bacterial communities suggesting that aminoglycosides are not only used by their producers as toxic molecules against their bacterial competitors, but could also provide protection against the threat of phage predation at the community level.</jats:p>",2021-05-02

Post-immunization boosting may be required, perhaps on an annual basis if the virus becomes an endemic pathogen. Seasonal influenza virus vaccines are already developed every year, an undertaking made possible by a robust global vaccine production and distribution infrastructure. To create a seasonal combination vaccine targeting influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 that is also amenable to frequent reformulation, we have developed a recombinant influenza A virus (IAV) genetic platform that reprograms the virus to package an immunogenic domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein onto IAV particles. Vaccination with this combination vaccine elicits neutralizing antibodies and provides protection from lethal challenge with both pathogens. This technology may allow for leveraging of established influenza vaccine infrastructure to generate a cost-effective and scalable seasonal vaccine solution for both influenza and coronaviruses.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

Despite their critical roles in embryonic development, how universal epigenetic regulators coordinate these specific tasks from single locus to chromosome-scale remains understudied. Here, we systematically disrupted multiple essential epigenetic pathways within polymorphic F1 zygotes to examine postimplantation effects on canonical and non-canonical genomic imprinting as well as X chromosome inactivation. We find that DNA methylation and Polycomb group repressors are both indispensable for autosomal imprinting, albeit at distinct gene sets. Moreover, the extraembryonic ectoderm relies on a broader spectrum of unique imprinting mechanisms, including non-canonical targeting of maternal endogenous retrovirus (ERV) driven promoters by G9a. We further utilize our data to identify Polycomb dependent and independent gene clusters on the imprinted X chromosome, which appears to reflect distinct domains of Xist-mediated suppression. Our data has allowed us to assemble a comprehensive inventory of the epigenetic mechanisms utilized in eutherian mammals to maintain parent-specific imprinting, including an expanded view of the placental lineage that comprises multiple unique pathways.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

Here we show that the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater can be used to estimate Re in near real-time, independent of clinical data and without associated biases stemming from clinical testing and reporting strategies. The method to estimate Re from wastewater is robust and applicable to data from different countries and wastewater matrices. The resulting estimates are as similar to the Re estimates from case report data as Re estimates based on observed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are among each other. We further provide details on the effect of sampling frequency and the shedding load distribution on the ability to infer Re. To our knowledge, this is the first time Re has been estimated from wastewater. This method provides a low cost, rapid, and independent way to inform SARS-CoV-2 monitoring during the ongoing pandemic and is applicable to future wastewater-based epidemiology targeting other pathogens.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

Objectives: We sought to determine the effects of prior exposure to HCoV Betacoronavirus HKU1 spike protein on serologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein after intramuscular administration in mice. We also sought to understand the baseline seroprevalence of HKU1 spike antibodies in healthy children and to measure their correlation with SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing antibodies in children hospitalized with acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). 
Methods: Groups of 5 mice were injected intramuscularly with two doses of alum-adjuvanted HKU1 spike followed by SARS-CoV-2 spike; or the reciprocal regimen of SARS-Cov-2 spike followed by HKU1 spike. Sera collected 21 days following each injection was analyzed for IgG antibodies to HKU1 spike, SARS-CoV-2 spike, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Sera from children hospitalized with acute COVID-19, MIS-C or healthy controls (n=14 per group) were analyzed for these same antibodies.
Results: Mice primed with SARS-CoV-2 spike and boosted with HKU1 spike developed high titers of SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing antibodies; however, mice primed with HKU1 spike and boosted with SARS-CoV-2 spike were unable to mount neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. HKU1 spike antibodies were detected in all children with acute COVID-19, MIS-C, and healthy controls. Although children with MIS-C had significantly higher HKU1 spike titers than healthy children (GMT 37239 vs. 7551, P=0.012), these titers correlated positively with both SARS-CoV-2 binding (r=0.7577, P&lt;0.001) and neutralizing (r=0.6201, P=0.001) antibodies.
Conclusions: Prior murine exposure to HKU1 spike protein completely impeded the development of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, consistent with original antigenic sin. In contrast, the presence of HKU1 spike IgG antibodies in children with acute COVID-19 or MIS-C was not associated with diminished neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

Thus, the behavior of individual molecules during miRNA-mediated gene silencing, as well as their spatiotemporal regulation inside cells, remains mostly unknown. Here we report single-molecule methods to visualize each step of miRNA-mediated gene silencing in situ inside cells. Simultaneous visualization of single mRNAs, translation, and miRNA-binding revealed that miRNAs preferentially bind to translated mRNAs rather than untranslated mRNAs. Spatiotemporal analysis based on our methods uncovered that miRNAs bind to mRNAs immediately after nuclear export. Subsequently, miRNAs induced translational repression and mRNA decay within 30 and 60 min, respectively, after the binding to mRNAs.

We found that bipolar subtype birthdates are ordered and follow a centrifugal developmental axis. Spatial analysis revealed a striking oscillatory wave pattern of bipolar subtype birthdates, and lineage analyses suggest clonal restriction on homotypic subtype production. These results inspired a hierarchical model of neuronal subtype genesis in the mammalian retina, with the wave pattern of subtype birthdates arising from early asymmetric cell divisions among founding retinal progenitor cells.

Acute infection was associated with increased mature B cell progenitors in the circulation and the unexpected expansion of virus-targeting naïve-like B cells that further augmented during convalescence together with virus-specific memory B cells.

The preferential localization of MYB16 in SLGCs but not meristemoids suggests a link between cutin synthesis and stomatal development. Here, we showed that downregulation of MYB16 in meristemoids was directly mediated by the stomatal master transcription factor, SPEECHLESS (SPCH). The suppression of MYB16 before asymmetric division was crucial for stomatal patterning because overexpression or ectopic expression of MYB16 in meristemoids increased impermeability and elevated stomatal density and clusters. The aberrant pattern of stomata was due to reduced and disrupted establishment of polarity during asymmetric cell division. Manipulating polarity by growing seedlings on hard agar rescued stomatal clusters and polarity defects in MYB16 ectopic lines. By expressing a cutinase in MYB16 ectopic lines, stomatal clustering was reduced, which suggests that the ectopic accumulation of cuticle affects the polarity in asymmetrically dividing cells and causes clustered stomata. Taken together, inhibiting MYB16 expression by SPCH in early stomatal lineage is required to correctly place the polarity complex for proper stomatal patterning during leaf morphogenesis.</jats:p>",2021-05-03

Our results reveal expression of Piwil1 in a vertebrate somatic cell type, the neural crest–a migratory embryonic stem cell population. We show that Piwil1 is expressed at low levels throughout chick neural crest development, peaking just before neural crest cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition to leave the neural tube and migrate into the periphery. Importantly, loss of Piwil1 impedes neural crest emigration. Small RNA sequencing reveals somatic piRNAs with sequence signatures of an active ping pong loop. Coupled with Piwil1 knockout RNA-seq, our data suggest that Piwil1 regulates expression of the transposon derived gene ERNI in the chick dorsal neural tube, which in turn suppresses Sox2 expression to precisely control the timing of neural crest specification and emigration.

Here, we asked whether the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which provides sensory input to the visual cortex, is modulated by pupil-indexed arousal. Observing that the pupil size oscillates at multiple timescales, we developed a method to show that the spiking mode of the dLGN is predicted by pupil size oscillations over several of these timescales. Overall, we found that tonic spikes preferentially occurred during pupil dilation, while bursts occurred during contraction. These preferences could not be explained solely by pupil size per se or by the locomotion of the animal, and were also present during periods of stimulus viewing. We conclude that dLGN spiking activity is modulated by pupil-indexed arousal processes on various timescales, influencing the mode in which sensory signals are passed on to the cortex.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

However, most somatic mutations are harmless and some even confer a fitness advantage to the organism carrying them. We hypothesized that heritable, germline genotypes that are likely to express an advantageous phenotype via non-heritable somatic mutation will have a selective advantage over other germline genotypes, and this advantage will channel evolving populations toward more fit germline genotypes, thus promoting adaptation. We tested this hypothesis by simulating evolving populations of developing organisms with an impermeable germline-soma separation navigating a minimal fitness landscape. The simulations revealed the conditions under which non-heritable somatic mutations promote adaptation. Specifically, this can occur when the somatic mutation supply is high, when only very few cells with the advantageous somatic mutation are required to increase organismal fitness, and when the somatic mutation also confers a selective advantage to cells with that mutation. We therefore provide proof-of-principle that non-heritable somatic mutations can promote adaptive evolution via a process we call somatic genotypic exploration. We discuss the biological plausibility of this phenomenon, as well as its evolutionary implications.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

In this fMRI study, we assessed age differences in neural selectivity during first encoding, repeated encoding, and recognition, as well as the underlying pattern (broadening versus attenuation). We found lower neural selectivity in older compared to younger adults during all memory stages. Crucially, while reduced selectivity in older adults was due to neural broadening during first encoding, it was driven by neural attenuation during recognition, but revealed no clear pattern during repeated encoding. Our findings suggest that intrinsic differences between memory stages may interact with neural activity to manifest as either neural broadening or attenuation. Moreover, despite these differential patterns, neural selectivity was highly correlated across memory stages, indicating that one common mechanism may underly distinct expressions of age-related neural dedifferentiation.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

The retrieval of threat memory by the presentation of the conditioning tone alone elicits acetylcholine (ACh) release in the BLA and the BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons manifest immediate early gene responses and display increased intrinsic excitability for 2-5 hours following the cue-elicited memory response to the conditioned stimulus. Silencing cue-associated engram-enrolled cholinergic neurons prevents the expression of the defensive response and the subset of cholinergic neurons activated by cue is distinct from those engaged by innate threat.

Moreover, many methods are difficult to install, poorly documented, and difficult to reproduce. Results: We present TransposonUltimate, a powerful bundle of three modules for transposon classification, annotation, and detection of transposition events. TransposonUltimate comes as a Conda package under the GPL-3.0 licence, is well documented and it is easy to install. We benchmark the classification module on the large TransposonDB covering over 891,051 sequences to demonstrate that it outperforms the currently best existing solutions.

There are two distinct infection life-cycles in trypanosomatids; some species complete their entire life-cycle in a single host (monoxenous) while others infect two hosts (dixenous). Dixenous trypanosomatids are mostly vectored by insects, and the human trypanosomatid diseases are transmitted mainly by vectored parasites. While infection prevalence has been described for subsets of hosts and trypanosomatids, little is known about whether monoxenous and dixenous trypanosomatids differ in infection prevalence. Here, we use meta-analyses to synthesise all published evidence of trypanosomatid infection prevalence for the last two decades. We employed a semi-automated screening protocol, using machine learning algorithms and natural language processing, resulting in the qualitative inclusion of 569 citations and quantitative inclusion of 261 citations. We find striking difference in infection prevalence with monoxenous species having twice the infection prevalence (19.8%) than dixenous species (8.68%) in both insect and non-insect hosts and are more than three-fold more prevalent in insects (20.9%) compared to their dixenous kins (6.61%). We also find that dixenous trypanosomatids have lower infection prevalence among insects compared to their definitive hosts, which is consistent across dixenous genera. Within the monoxenous trypanosomatids, genera infecting bees are characterised with the highest prevalence, which does not vary between wild and managed bees. To our knowledge, these results reveal for the first time, a fundamental difference in infection prevalence according to host specificity where vectored species suffer from lower infection prevalence as a result of a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" style trade-off between the vector and definitive host.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

EGFR inhibitors have been successful in lung cancer, where the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain is mutated, but not in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) – where mutations (or deletions) occur exclusively in the EGFR extracellular region. Wild-type EGFR is known to elicit distinct signals in response to different growth factor ligands, exhibiting biased agonism. We recently showed that individual ligands stabilize distinct receptor dimer structures, which signal with different kinetics to specify outcome. EGF induces strong symmetric dimers that signal transiently to promote proliferation. Epiregulin (EREG) induces weak asymmetric dimers that generate sustained signaling and differentiation. Intriguingly, several GBM mutation hotspots coincide with residues that define the asymmetric and symmetric dimer structures. Here, we show that common extracellular GBM mutations prevent EGFR from distinguishing between EGF and EREG based on dimer structure and stability – allowing strong dimers to form with both ligands. Crystal structures show that the R84K mutation symmetrizes EREG-driven dimers, whereas the A265V mutation remodels key dimerization sites. Our results suggest that modulating EGFR’s biased agonism plays an important role in GBM, and suggest new approaches for ‘correcting’ aberrant EGFR signaling in cancer.</jats:p>",2021-05-04

The extent to which correlated activity affects behavior depends on the properties of its translation into movement. We developed a novel method that estimates the contribution of correlations in the frontal eye field (FEF) to pursuit eye movements. We defined a distance metric between the behavior on different trials. Based on this metric, we applied a sequence of shuffles to the neuronal responses, allowing trials to be matched with increasingly distant trials. Correlations between neurons were strongly attenuated when applying even the most constrained shuffle. Thus, only a small fraction of FEF correlations affects the behavior. We used simulations to validate our approach and demonstrate its generalizability over different models. We show that the attenuation of correlated activity through the motor pathway could stem from the interplay between the structure of the correlations and the decoder of FEF activity.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

However, ancient DNA data is considerably more degraded and contaminated than modern data making the identification of ancient viral genomes particularly challenging. Several methods to characterise the modern microbiome (and, within this, the virome) have been developed. Many of them assign sequenced reads to specific taxa to characterise the organisms present in a sample of interest. While these existing tools are routinely used in modern data, their performance when applied to ancient virome data remains unknown. In this work, we conduct an extensive simulation study using public viral sequences to establish which tool is the most suitable for ancient virome studies. We compare the performance of four widely used classifiers, namely Centrifuge, Kraken2, DIAMOND and MetaPhlAn2, in correctly assigning sequencing reads to the corresponding viruses. To do so, we simulate reads by adding noise typical of ancient DNA to a randomly chosen set of publicly available viral sequences and to the human genome. We fragment the DNA into different lengths, add sequencing error and C to T and G to A deamination substitutions at the read termini. Then we measure the resulting precision and sensitivity for all classifiers. Across most simulations, 119 out of the 120 simulated viruses are recovered by Centrifuge, Kraken2 and DIAMOND in contrast to MetaPhlAn2 which recovers only around one third. While deamination damage has little impact on the performance of the classifiers, DIAMOND and Kraken2 cannot classify very short reads. For data with longer fragments, if precision is strongly favoured over sensitivity, DIAMOND performs best. However, since Centrifuge can handle short reads and since it achieves the highest sensitivity and precision at the species level, it is our recommended tool overall. Regardless of the tool used, our simulations indicate that, for ancient human studies, users should use strict filters to remove all reads of potential human origin. Finally, if the goal is to detect a specific virus, given the high variability observed among tested viral sequences, a simulation study to determine if a given tool can recover the virus of interest should be conducted prior to analysing real data.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

To address this question, we text mined 917,645 literature abstracts followed by manual curation, and found strong, non-random associations between age-related diseases and aging mechanisms, confirmed by gene set enrichment analysis of GWAS data. Integration of these associations with clinical data from 3.01 million patients showed that age-related diseases associated with each of five aging mechanisms were more likely than chance to be present together in patients. Genetic evidence revealed that innate and adaptive immunity, the intrinsic apoptotic signalling pathway and activity of the ERK1/2 pathway played a significant role across multiple aging mechanisms and multiple, diverse age-related diseases. Mechanisms of aging therefore contribute to multiple age-related diseases and to patterns of human age-related multimorbidity, and could potentially be targeted to prevent more than one age-related condition in the same patient.</jats:p>",2021-05-05

In contrast, low dose of SARS-CoV-2 via fomites did not result in productive infection in the majority of exposed hamsters and these animals remained non-seroconverted. After recovery, hamsters were re-exposed to hCoV-19/South African/KRISP-K005325/2020 (VOC B.1.351) via an intranasal challenge. Seroconverted rechallenged animals did not lose weight and shed virus for 3 days. They had little infectious virus and no pathology in the lungs. In contrast, shedding, weight loss and extensive pulmonary pathology caused by B.1.351 replication was observed in the non-seroconverted animals. The rechallenged seroconverted animals did not transmit virus to naive sentinels via direct contact transmission, in contrast to the non-seroconverted animals. Reinfection with B.1.351 triggered an anamnestic response that boosted not only neutralizing titers against lineage A, but also titers against B.1.351. Our results confirm that aerosol exposure is a more efficient infection route than fomite exposure. Furthermore, initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 lineage A does not prevent heterologous reinfection with B.1.351 but prevents disease and onward transmission. These data suggest that previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure induces partial protective immunity. The reinfection generated a broadly neutralizing humoral response capable of effectively neutralizing B.1.351 while maintaining its ability to neutralize the virus to which the initial response was directed against.</jats:p>",2021-05-05

Many quantitative analyses rely on structured data, but the extraction of specific information such as the time and place of outbreaks is a tedious process. Machine learning algorithms for natural language processing (NLP) can potentially facilitate the establishment of datasets, but their use in plague research has not been explored much yet. We investigated the performance of five pre-trained NLP libraries (Google NLP, Stanford CoreNLP, spaCy, germaNER and Geoparser.io) for the extraction of location data from a German plague treatise published in 1908 compared to the gold standard of manual annotation. Of all tested algorithms, we found that Stanford CoreNLP had the best overall performance but spaCy showed the highest sensitivity. Moreover, we demonstrate how word associations can be extracted and displayed with simple text mining techniques in order to gain a quick insight into salient topics. Finally, we compared our newly digitised plague dataset to a re-digitised version of the famous Biraben plague list and update the spatio-temporal extent of the second pandemic plague mentions.

Infants born earlier had areas of higher relative ventricular volume, and lower relative brain volume in the basal ganglia, cerebellum and brainstem. Earlier birth was also associated with lower fractional anisotropy, higher mean, axial and radial diffusivity in major white matter tracts. Gestational age at birth was positively associated with all Bayley-III subscales at age 18 months. Linear regression models predicting outcome from gestational age at birth were significantly improved by adding neuroimaging features associated with gestational age at birth.

However, these methods range in effectiveness, can harm honey bees, can be physically demanding on the beekeeper, and do not always provide complete protection from Varroa. More importantly, in some populations Varroa mites have developed resistance to available acaricides. Overcoming the Varroa mite problem will require novel and targeted treatment options.

We show that spreading a neutral gene drive in Varroa is possible but requires specific colony-level management practices to overcome the challenges of both inbreeding and haplodiploidy. Furthermore, continued treatment with acaricides is necessary to give a gene drive time to fix in the Varroa population. Unfortunately, a gene drive that impacts female or male fertility does not spread in Varroa. Therefore, we suggest that the most promising way forward is to use a gene drive which carries a toxin precursor or removes acaricide resistance alleles.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

This “early” olfactory information process has two important characteristics. First, response of a PN to its cognate ORN is normalized by the overall activity of other ORNs, a phenomenon termed “divisive normalization”. Second, PNs respond strongly to the onset of ORN activities, but they adapt to prolonged or continuously increasing inputs. Despite the importance of these characteristics for learning and memory, their underlying mechanism remains not fully understood. Here, we develop a circuit model for describing the ORN-LN-PN dynamics by including key features of neuron-neuron interactions, in particular short-term plasticity (STP) and presynaptic inhibition (PI). Our model shows that STP is critical in shaping PN’s steady-state response properties. By fitting our model to experimental data quantitatively, we found that strong and balanced short-term facilitation (STF) and short-term depression (STD) in STP is crucial for the observed nonlinear divisive normalization in <jats:italic>Drosophila</jats:italic>. By comparing our model with the observed adaptive response to time-varying signals quantitatively, we find that both STP and PI contribute to the highly adaptive response with the latter being the dominant factor for a better fit with experimental data. Our model not only helps reveal the mechanisms underlying two main characteristics of the early olfactory process, it can also be used to predict the PN responses to arbitrary time-dependent signals and to infer microscopic properties of the circuit (such as the strengths of STF and STD) from the measured input-output relation.</jats:p>",2021-05-02

In this study, we addressed the highly debated question of whether neural responses previously linked to affect sharing could result from the perception of salient affective displays. Moreover, we investigated how affect sharing and self-other distinction interact to determine our response to a pain that is either genuine, or merely pretended. We found stronger activations in regions associated with affect sharing (anterior insula, aIns, and anterior mid-cingulate cortex, aMCC) as well as with affective self-other distinction (right supramarginal gyrus, rSMG), in participants watching video clips of genuine vs. pretended facial expressions of pain. Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM), we then assessed the neural dynamics between the right aIns and rSMG in these two conditions. This revealed a reduced inhibitory effect on the aIns to rSMG connection for genuine compared to pretended pain. For genuine pain only, brain-to-behavior regression analyses highlighted a linkage between this inhibitory effect on the one hand, and pain ratings as well as empathic traits on the other. These findings imply that if the pain of others is genuine and thus calls for an appropriate empathic response, neural responses in the aIns indeed seem related to affect sharing and self-other distinction is engaged to avoid empathic over-arousal. In contrast, if others merely pretend to be in pain, the perceptual salience of their painful expression results in neural responses that are down-regulated to avoid inappropriate affect sharing and social support.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

Attempts to model the RP as an accumulation-to-bound process suggest that this signal is a by-product of time-locking to crests in neural noise rather than the outcome of a pre-conscious decision to initiate a movement. One parameter of the model accounts for the imperative to move now, with cued movements having a strong imperative and purely spontaneous movements having no imperative. Two different variants of the model have been proposed, and both predict a decrease in the (negative) amplitude of the early RP as the imperative grows stronger. In order to test this empirically, we conducted an experiment where subjects produced self-initiated movements under varying levels of time pressure, and we investigated the amplitude, shape, and latency of the RP as a function of the imperative to move, operationalised as a time limit. We identified distinct changes in the amplitude of the early RP that grew non-linearly as the time limit grew shorter. Thus these data did not support the prediction made by the model.

We show that the first 132 amino acids of TAN1 (TAN1(1-132)) rescue the tan1 air9 double mutant and localize to the division site during telophase. Loss of both rescue and division-site localization occurred when interaction between TAN1 and PHRAGMOPLAST ORIENTING KINESIN1 (POK1) was disrupted by replacing six amino acid residues with alanines in TAN1(1-132). However, full-length TAN1 with the same alanine substitutions significantly rescued the tan1 air9 double mutant and remained at the division site throughout mitosis, although its accumulation was reduced and phragmoplast positioning defects occurred. POK1 often fails to accumulate at the division site in tan1 air9 mutants, suggesting that both TAN1 and AIR9 stabilize POK1 there.

While there is general knowledge regarding the taxonomic groups that leeches prefer to feed on, detailed taxonomic resolution is still missing and therefore, their potential use for monitoring animals is not known. In this study, 116 non-haemadipsid leeches belonging to 12 species and spanning the three feeding habits were collected in Mexico and Canada.

We detected vertebrate taxa from five orders including fish, turtles and birds in the diet of the aquatic haematophagous leeches; eight invertebrate orders of annelids, arthropods and molluscs in the liquidosomatophagous leeches; and ten orders of invertebrates belonging to Arthropoda and Annelida, as well as one vertebrate and one parasitic nematode, in the macrophagous leeches. These results show the potential use of iDNA from the gut content of aquatic haematophagous leeches for retrieving vertebrate taxa, and from macrophagous and liquidosomatophagous counterparts for invertebrates.

The purpose of this pilot observational study was to examine the relationships between serum neurofilament light protein (NfL, a measure of neuronal injury) and co-morbid cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neurological complications in COVID-19 positive patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). In this observational study of one-hundred patients who were admitted to the ICU in Tucson, Arizona between April and August 2020, 89 were positive for COVID-19 (COVID-pos) and 11 were COVID-negative (COVID-neg). A healthy control group (n=8) was examined for comparison. The primary outcomes and measures were subject demographics, serum NfL, presence and extent of CVD, diabetes, sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA), presence of neurological complications, and blood chemistry panel data. COVID-pos patients in the ICU had significantly higher mean levels of Nfl (229.6±163 pg/ml) compared to COVID-neg ICU patients (19.3±5.6 pg/ml), Welch’s t-test, p =.01 and healthy controls (12.3±3.1 pg/ml), Welch’s t-test p =.005. Levels of Nfl in COVID-pos ICU patients were significantly higher in patients with concomitant CVD and diabetes (n=35, log Nfl 1.6±.09), and correlated with higher SOFA scores (r=.5, p =.001). These findings suggest that in severe COVID-19 disease, the central neuronal and axonal damage in these patients may be driven, in part, by the level of systemic cardiovascular disease and peripheral inflammation. Understanding the contributions of systemic inflammatory disease to central neurological degeneration in these COVID-19 survivors will be important to the design of interventional therapies to prevent long-term neurological and cognitive dysfunction.</jats:p>",2021-05-02

Early transmission models focused on surface contamination, but current research provides evidence for person-to-person transmission via aerosolized viral particles. As such, the CDC’s guidance has recently been updated to increasingly redirect the focus of prevention methods to aerosol routes. Inhalation of SARS-CoV-2 particles presents the most significant threat of infection to individuals. A secondary route, from hand to mouth, eyes or nose, is likely after contact with a surface contaminated with particles that have settled out of aerosols or been deposited by contaminated hands. Using common molecular detection methods including endpoint and quantitative PCR, we investigated whether there is detectable contamination by SARS-CoV-2 on high-touch surfaces on public transit vehicles and on other high-touch surfaces on a college campus during normal use. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can be successfully recovered and detected on common high-touch surfaces, albeit in comparatively lower frequencies as public health guidance progressed and more rigorous sanitization procedures were implemented.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Abstract Figure</jats:title><jats:fig id=""ufig1"" position=""float"" fig-type=""figure"" orientation=""portrait""><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""21256107v1_ufig1"" position=""float"" orientation=""portrait"" /></jats:fig><jats:p><jats:bold>Graphical abstract created with permission from <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" ext-link-type=""uri"" xlink:href=""http://BioRender.com"">BioRender.com</jats:ext-link> (2021)</jats:bold>.</jats:p></jats:sec>",2021-05-04

Molecular ecology approaches are commonly used for RNA viruses harboring small genomes, but have only rarely been applied to DNA viruses with large genomes. Here, we used the Pacific oyster mortality syndrome (POMS, a disease that affects oyster farms around the world) as a model to study the genetic diversity of its causative agent, the Ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) in the three main French oyster-farming areas. Using ultra-deep sequencing on individual moribund oysters and new bioinformatics methodology, we de novo assembled 21 OsHV-1 genomes. Combining whole-genome comparisons with phylogenetic analysis and quantification of major and minor variants, we assessed the connectivity of OsHV-1 viral populations between the three oyster-farming areas. Our results suggest that the Marennes-Oleron Bay represents the main source of OsHV-1 diversity, from where the virus has dispersed to other farming areas, a scenario consistent with current practices of oyster transfers in France.

Currently, known differences between these two states are mostly phenomenological, and none can adequately explain why the two states should differ in developmental priming. Gene occlusion is a mode of epigenetic inactivation that renders genes unresponsive to their cognate transcriptional activators. It plays a crucial role in lineage restriction. Here, we report that a defining feature distinguishing the two pluripotent states lies in the ability of naive but not primed cells to erase occlusion. This “deocclusion” capacity requires Esrrb, a gene expressed only in the naive but not primed state. Notably, Esrrb silencing in the primed state is itself due to occlusion. Collectively, our data argue that the Esrrb-dependent deocclusion capacity in naive cells is key for sustaining naive pluripotency, and the loss of this capacity in the primed state via the occlusion of Esrrb poises cells for differentiation.</jats:p>",2021-05-04

In the colon of VDRΔIEC mice, deletion of intestinal VDR led to lower protein and mRNA levels of Claudin-5. Intestine permeability was increased in the VDR-/- colon cancer model. Lack of VDR and a reduction of Claudin-5 are associated with an increased number of tumors in the VDR-/- and VDRΔIEC mice. Furthermore, gain and loss of function studies have identified CLDN-5 as a downstream target of VDR. Epithelial VDR overexpression protected against the loss of Claudin 5 in response to inflammation.

The resin background of the images was segmented at different slices of a 3D stack of 518 slices with 8, 192 x 8, 192 pixels each. The background was used to create a distance map which helped identify and rank the cells by their size at each slice. The centroids of the cells detected at different slices were linked to identify them as a single cell that spanned a number of slices. A subset of these cells, i.e., largest ones and those not close to the edges were selected for further processing. The selected cells were then automatically cropped to smaller regions of interest of 2, 000 x 2, 000 x 300 voxels that were treated as cell instances. Then, for each of these volumes the nucleus was segmented and the cell was separated from any neighbouring cells through a series of traditional image processing steps that followed the plasma membrane. The segmentation process was repeated for all the regions selected. For one cell for which the ground truth was available, the algorithm provided excellent results in Accuracy (AC) and Jaccard Index (JI): Nucleus: JI = 0.9665, AC= 0.9975, Cell and Nucleus JI = 0.8711, AC = 0.9655, Cell only JI = 0.8094, AC = 0.9629.

When tested for these conditions, the segmentation of the nuclear envelope was still possible. All the code and data are released openly through GitHub, Zenodo and EMPIAR.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

Thus, this process is essential for sexual reproduction and human fertility. Germ cells depend on signals from the somatic gonad to determine their sex, but in organisms such as flies, mice and humans, the sex chromosome genotype of the germ cells is also important for germline sexual development. How somatic signals and germ cell-intrinsic cues act together to regulate germline sex determination is a key question about which little is known. We have found that JAK/STAT signaling in the GSC niche promotes male identity in germ cells and GSCs, in part by activating expression of the epigenetic reader Phf7. We have also found that JAK/STAT signaling is blocked in XX (female) germ cells through the intrinsic action of the sex determination gene <jats:italic>Sex lethal</jats:italic>, which preserves female identity.

In Brazil, this mitigation strategy was first implemented in March 2020 and mainly monitored by social isolation indicators built from mobile geolocation data. While it is well known that social isolation has been playing a crucial role in epidemic control, the precise connections between mobility data indicators and epidemic dynamic parameters have a complex interdependence. In this work, we investigate this dependence for several Brazilian cities, looking also at socioeconomic and demographic factors that influence it. As expected, the increase in the social isolation indicator was shown to be related to the decrease in the speed of transmission of the disease, but the relation was shown to depend on the urban hierarchy level of the city, the human development index and also the epidemic curve stage. Moreover, a high social isolation at the beginning of the epidemic relates to a strong positive impact on flattening the epidemic curve, while less efficacy of this mitigation strategy was observed when it has been implemented later. Mobility data plays an important role in epidemiological modeling and decision-making, however, we discuss in this work how a direct relationship between social isolation data and COVID-19 data is hard to be established. Understanding this interplay is a key factor to better modeling, for which we hope this study contributes.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

These copy number alterations contribute to cancer initiaition, progression and therapeutic resistance. Here, we present a conceptual framework for examining the patterns of copy number alterations in human cancer using whole-genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, and SNP6 microarray data making it widely applicable to diverse datasets. Deploying this framework to 9,873 cancers representing 33 human cancer types from the TCGA project revealed a set of 19 copy number signatures that explain the copy number patterns of 93% of TCGA samples. 15 copy number signatures were attributed to biological processes of whole-genome doubling, aneuploidy, loss of heterozygosity, homologous recombination deficiency, and chromothripsis.  The aetiology of four copy number signatures are unexplained and some cancer types have unique patterns of amplicon signatures associated with extrachromosomal DNA, disease-specific survival, and gains of proto-oncogenes such as MDM2. In contrast to base-scale mutational signatures, no copy number signature associated with known cancer risk factors. The results provide a foundation for exploring patterns of copy number changes in cancer genomes and synthesise the global landscape of copy number alterations in human cancer by revealing a diversity of mutational processes giving rise to copy number changes.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

WGDI supports three main workflows (polyploid inference, hierarchical inference of genomic homology, and ancestral chromosomal karyotyping) that can improve detection of WGD and characterization of related events. It incorporates a more sensitive and accurate collinearity detection algorithm than previous softwares, and can accelerate WGD-related karyotype research. As a freely available toolkit at GitHub (https://github.com/SunPengChuan/wgdi), WGDI outperforms similar tools in terms of efficiency, flexibility and scalability.

Polyploid plants derived from whole genome duplication are believed to have an enhanced abiotic stress tolerance. In this study, the impact of high temperatures on male meiosis in autotetraploid Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated. We found that autotetraploid Columbia (Col-0) plants generate a subpopulation of aberrant meiotic products under normal temperature, which is significantly increased under heat stress. Cytological studies revealed that, as the case in diploid Arabidopsis thaliana, assembly of microtubular cytoskeleton network, pairing and segregation of homologous chromosomes, and meiotic recombination in autotetraploid Arabidopsis are compromised under the high temperatures. Immunostaining of ?H2A.X and recombinase DMC1 suggested that heat stress inhibits formation of DNA double-strand breaks; additionally, it specifically destabilizes ASY1 and ASY4, but not SYN1 on chromosomes. The loading defects of ASY1 and ASY4 overlap in the syn1 mutant, which supports that the building of lateral element of synaptonemal complex occurs downstream of a SYN1-ASY4-ASY3 stepwise assembly of axis. Remarkably, heat-induced abnormalities of ASY1 and ASY4 co-localize on chromosomes of both diploid and autotetraploid Arabidopsis, suggesting that high temperatures interfere with ASY1-associated SC via an impacted stability of chromosome axis. Furthermore, ZYP1-dependent transverse filament of SC is disrupted by heat stress. Taken together, these findings suggest that polyploidization negatively contributes to instability of chromosomes and meiotic recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana under heat stress.</jats:p>",2021-05-06

To test this hypothesis, we trained participants to recognize vibrotactile versions of auditory words using two encoding schemes. The vocoded approach preserved the dynamics and representational similarities of auditory speech while the token-based approach used an abstract phoneme-based code. Although both groups learned the vibrotactile word recognition task, only in the vocoded group did trained vibrotactile stimuli recruit the auditory speech network and lead to increased coupling between somatosensory and auditory speech areas.

By contrast, LOF of β-catenin in TECs reduces the number of cortical TECs and thymocytes modestly and only postnatally.

In combination, this amounts to a scheme of field inversion of the SIRD parameters over each time step. Applied to data over ten months of 2020 for the pandemic in the US state of Michigan and to all of Mexico, our system inference via field inversion infers spatio-temporally varying PDE SIRD parameters that replicate the progression of the pandemic with high accuracy.

We confirm previous findings and find that the rate of adaptive evolution, relative to the rate of mutation, is higher for more exposed amino acids, lower for amino acid pairs that are more dissimilar in terms of their polarity, volume and a more generalised measure of amino acid dissimilarity, the ratio of the numbers of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphisms (pN/pS). However, the slope of this latter relationship is significantly shallower than in Drosophila species. We suggest that this is due to the population contraction that has occurred since humans and chimpanzees diverged. We demonstrate theoretically that population size reduction can generate an artefactual positive correlation between the rate of adaptive evolution and any factor that is correlated to the mean strength of selection acting against deleterious mutations, even if there has been no adaptive evolution (the converse is also expected). Our measure of amino acid dissimilarity, pN/pS, is negatively correlated to the mean strength of selection, and hence we would expect the correlation between the rate of adaptive evolution to also be negatively correlated to pN/pS, if there is no adaptive evolution. The fact that our rate of adaptive evolution is positively correlated to pN/pS suggests that the correlation does genuinely exist, but that is has been attenuated by population size contraction.</jats:p>",2021-05-05

We set out to establish a system-wide profile of the KRAS-regulated kinase signaling network (kinome) in KRAS-mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We knocked down KRAS expression in a panel of six cell lines, and then applied Multiplexed Inhibitor Bead/Mass Spectrometry (MIB/MS) chemical proteomics to monitor changes in kinase activity and/or expression. We hypothesized that depletion of KRAS would result in downregulation of kinases required for KRAS-mediated transforming activities, and in upregulation of other kinases that could potentially compensate for the deleterious consequences of the loss of KRAS. We identified 15 upregulated and 13 downregulated kinases in common across the panel. In agreement with our hypothesis, all 15 of the upregulated kinases have established roles as cancer drivers (e.g., SRC, TGFBR1, ILK), and pharmacologic inhibition of the upregulated kinase, DDR1, suppressed PDAC growth. Interestingly, 11 of the 13 downregulated kinases have established driver roles in cell cycle progression, particularly in mitosis (e.g., WEE1, Aurora A, PLK1). Consistent with a crucial role for the downregulated kinases in promoting KRAS-driven proliferation, we found that pharmacologic inhibition of WEE1 also suppressed PDAC growth. The unexpected paradoxical activation of ERK upon WEE1 inhibition led us to inhibit both WEE1 and ERK concurrently, which caused further potent growth suppression and enhanced apoptotic death than WEE1 inhibition alone. We conclude that system-wide delineation of the KRAS-regulated kinome can identify potential therapeutic targets for KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer.</jats:p>",2021-04-30

Many insects are subject to a trade-off between reproduction and immune activity, meaning that infections can have indirect impacts on fecundity, even in the absence of overt symptoms. While eusocial insects have escaped a broader trade-off between reproduction and lifespan, our results suggest that honey bees, a model Hymenopteran, are susceptible to reproduction-immunity compromises. We report that natural viral infection is associated with decreased ovary mass and upregulation of heat-shock proteins (HSPs) which are part of the honey bee's antiviral response. Failed (poor quality) queens sampled from a wide geographic range have higher levels of viral infection, smaller ovaries, and altered ovarian protein composition, with over 20% of proteins differentially expressed. Significantly reduced levels of the yolk-protein precursor vitellogenin in the ovaries indicate a direct decline in fertility. We experimentally infected queens with Israeli acute paralysis virus and, as expected, infected queens exhibited significantly lower vitellogenin expression and higher HSP expression, confirming a causal relationship between viral infection and genes involved in fertility and immunity. The link between ovary size and queen failure could not be explained by other abiotic stressors. These findings suggest that viral infections occurring naturally in the field are compromising reproductive success, even among social insects.</jats:p>",2021-05-04

While a reliable protein function assignment can be obtained by experimental characterization, this is expensive and time-consuming, and the number of such Gold Standard Proteins (GSP) with experimental support remains very low compared to proteins annotated by sequence homology, usually through automated pipelines. Even a GSP may give a misleading assignment when used as a reference: the homolog may be close enough to support isofunctionality, but the substrate of the GSP is absent from the species being annotated. In such cases the enzymes cannot be isofunctional.
