                <jats:p>The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants highlighted the need to better
                    understand adaptive immune responses to this virus. It is important to address
                    whether also CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are affected, because of the role
                    they play in disease resolution and modulation of COVID-19 disease severity.
                    Here we performed a comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+
                    T cell responses from COVID-19 convalescent subjects recognizing the ancestral
                    strain, compared to variant lineages B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and CAL.20C as well

                    vaccines. Similarly, we demonstrate that the sequences of the vast majority of
                    SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes are not affected by the mutations found in the
                    variants analyzed. Overall, the results demonstrate that CD4+ and CD8+ T cell
                    responses in convalescent COVID-19 subjects or COVID-19 mRNA vaccinees are not
                    substantially affected by mutations found in the SARS-CoV-2 variants.</jats:p>",2021-03-01

The human antiviral factor SAMHD1 takes advantage of this vulnerability in the viral life cycle, and inhibits viral replication by degrading dNTPs into their constituent deoxynucleosides and inorganic phosphate. In this study we report that bacteria employ a similar strategy to defend against phage infection. We found a family of defensive dCTP deaminase proteins that, in response to phage infection, convert dCTP into deoxy-uracil nucleotides. A second family of phage resistance genes encode dGTPase enzymes, which degrade dGTP into phosphate-free deoxy-guanosine (dG) and are distant homologs of the human SAMHD1. Our results show that the defensive proteins completely eliminate the specific deoxynucleotide (either dCTP or dGTP) from the nucleotide pool during phage infection, thus starving the phage of an essential DNA building block and halting its replication. Both defensive genes are found in a diverse set of bacterial species and are specifically enriched in Vibrio genomes. Our study demonstrates that manipulation of the deoxynucleotide pool is a potent antiviral strategy shared by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.</jats:p>",2021-04-26

The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine has demonstrated high protection levels, yet apprehension exists that several variants of concerns (VOCs) can surmount the immune defenses generated by the vaccines. Neutralization assays have revealed some reduction in neutralization of VOCs B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, but the relevance of these assays in real life remains unclear. We performed a case-control study that examined the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 variants observed in infections of vaccinated individuals (‚Äúbreakthrough cases‚Äù) and matched infections of unvaccinated individuals. We hypothesized that if there is lower vaccine effectiveness against one of the VOCs, its proportion among the breakthrough cases should be higher than among unvaccinated cases. Our results show that vaccinees that tested positive at least a week after the second dose were indeed disproportionally infected with B.1.351, as compared with unvaccinated individuals (odds ratio of 8:1). Those who tested positive between two weeks after the first dose and one week after the second dose, were disproportionally infected by B.1.1.7 (odds ratio of 26:10), suggesting reduced vaccine effectiveness against both VOCs at particular time windows following vaccination. Nevertheless, the B.1.351 incidence in Israel to-date remains low and vaccine effectiveness remains high among those fully vaccinated. These results overall suggest that vaccine breakthrough infection may be more frequent with both VOCs, yet a combination of mass-vaccination with two doses coupled with non-pharmaceutical interventions control and contain their spread.</jats:p>",2021-04-09

It is of great concern that newly emerging variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can escape antibody-mediated protection induced by previous infection or vaccination through mutations in the spike protein. The glutamate (E) to Lysine (K) substitution at position 484 (E484K) in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is present in the rapidly spreading variants of concern belonging to the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages. We performed <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> microneutralization assays with both the USA-WA1/2020 virus and a recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 virus that is identical to USA-WA1/2020 except for the E484K mutation introduced in the spike RBD. We selected 34 sera from study participants based on their SARS-CoV-2 spike ELISA antibody titer (negative [N=4] versus weak [N=8], moderate [N=11] or strong positive [N=11]). In addition, we included sera from five individuals who received two doses of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2. Serum neutralization efficiency was lower against the E484K rSARS-CoV-2 (vaccination samples: 3.4 fold; convalescent low IgG: 2.4 fold, moderate IgG: 4.2 fold and high IgG: 2.6 fold) compared to USA-WA1/2020.

However, human sera with high neutralization titers against the USA-WA1/2020 strain were still able to neutralize the E484K rSARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is important to aim for the highest titers possible induced by vaccination to enhance protection against newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Two vaccine doses may be needed for induction of high antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2. Postponing the second vaccination is suggested by some public health authorities in order to provide more individuals with a primer vaccination.

Methods: Test rooms, including a hospital single-patient room, were filled with test aerosol to simulate aerosol movement. Aerosol counts were measured over time with various portable air cleaning devices and room ventilation systems to quantify the aerosol concentration reduction rate and overall clearance rate.

Results: Portable air cleaners were very effective in removing aerosols, especially for the devices with high flow rate. In a small control room, the aerosols were cleared 4 to 5 times faster with portable air cleaners than the room with HVAC alone. A single bed hospital room equipped with an excellent ventilation rate (~ 14 air changes per hour) can clear the aerosols in 20 minutes. However, with the addition of two air cleaners, the clearance time became 3 times faster (in 6 minutes and 30 seconds).

Conclusions: Portable air cleaning devices with HEPA filtration were highly effective at removing aerosols. To clear aerosols (above 90% clearance) in under 10 minutes requires around 25 air changes per hour; readily feasible with air cleaners.

Many machine learning algorithms to detect AD have been trained using limited training data, meaning they often generalize poorly when applied to scans from previously unseen populations. Here we aimed to build a practical brain imaging-based AD diagnostic classifier using deep learning/transfer learning on dataset of unprecedented size and diversity. We pooled MRI data from more than 217 sites/scanners to constitute the largest brain MRI sample to date (85,721 scans from 50,876 participants). Next, we applied a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, Inception-ResNet-V2, to build a sex classifier with high generalization capability. The sex classifier achieved 94.9% accuracy and served as a base model in transfer learning for the objective diagnosis of AD. After transfer learning, the model fine-tuned for AD classification achieved 91.3% accuracy in leave-sites-out cross-validation on the Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and 94.2%/87.9% accuracy for direct tests on two unseen independent datasets (AIBL/OASIS). When this AD classifier was tested on brain images from unseen mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, MCI patients who finally converted to AD were 3 times more likely to be predicted as AD than MCI patients who did not convert (65.2% vs 20.6%). Predicted scores from the AD classifier showed significant correlations with illness severity. In sum, the proposed AD classifier could offer a medical-grade biomarker that could be integrated into AD diagnostic practice.

Starting from a continuum theory of macroscopic phase separation we derive a stochastic Langevin equation for molecular trajectories that takes into account thermal fluctuations. We find that molecular trajectories can be described as diffusion with drift in an effective potential, which has a steep gradient at phase boundaries. We discuss how the physics of phase coexistence affects the statistics of molecular trajectories and in particular the statistics of displacements of molecules crossing a phase boundary. At thermodynamic equilibrium detailed balance imposes that the distributions of displacements crossing the phase boundary from the dense or from the dilute phase are the same. Our theory can be used to infer key phase separation parameters from the statistics of single-molecule trajectories. For simple Brownian motion, there is no drift in the presence of a concentration gradient. We show that interactions in the fluid give rise to an average drift velocity in concentration gradients. Interestingly, under non-equilibrium conditions, single molecules tend to drift uphill the concentration gradient. Thus, our work bridges between single-molecule dynamics and collective dynamics at macroscopic scales and provides a framework to study single-molecule dynamics in phase-separating systems.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

We used a database from the Veneto Region system of SARS-CoV-2 secondary cases tracing in Verona province schools to estimate number of tests, the frequency of secondary infections at school by type of index case and the ratio positive cases/ number of tests per school institute using an adjusted multivariable generalized linear regression model.

However, when compared with incidence among similar age groups, the difference was not significant (P=0.23). Secondary infections among teachers were more frequent when the index case was a teacher than a student (38% vs. 11%, P=0.007). From August 28 to October 25 in Veneto where school reopened on September 14, the growth of SARS-CoV- 2 incidence was lower in school age individuals, maximal in 20-29 and 45-49 years old individuals. The delay between the different school opening dates in the different Italian regions and the increase in the regional Covid19 reproduction number R<jats:sub>t</jats:sub>was not uniform.

Whether schools contributed to the so called ‚Äúsecond wave‚Äù of Covid19 is uncertain.

In Veneto, during the first phase of the second wave incidence among school age individuals was low as opposed to the sustained incidence among individuals of 45-49 years.

We here distinguish between a ""dark taxon impediment"" caused by a large number of undescribed species and a ""superficial description impediment"" caused by species descriptions so imprecise that type specimens have to be consulted in order to resolve species identities. Recently, Sharkey et al. (2021) proposed to address the dark taxon impediment for Costa Rican braconid wasps by describing 403 species based on barcode clusters (""BINs"") computed by BOLD Systems. The default assumption of the revision is that BIN=Species (e.g., BOLD:ACM9419 becomes Bracon federicomatarritai Sharkey, sp. nov.) and therefore the diagnoses of most species consist only of a consensus barcode. We here argue that this type of ""minimalist revision"" is unnecessary and undesirable. It is unnecessary because barcode clusters (e.g. BINs) already provide grouping statements that overcome many of the obstacles associated with dark taxon impediments. However, minimalist revisions are also undesirable and problematic because the diagnoses are only based on one character system - that in the case of Sharkey et al. was poorly analyzed. Furthermore, the revision relies on units that violate basic rules of reproducibility because the BINs were delimited by a proprietary algorithm (RESL) that is applied to a mixture of public and private data. Here, we illustrate that many of the BINs described as species are unstable when the available public data are reanalyzed, reiterate that COI mostly measures time of divergence, and that BOLD Systems violates key principles of open science. We conclude by urging authors, reviewers, editors, and grantors to only publish and fund projects that adhere to modern standards of reproducibility.</jats:p>",2021-04-29

Although research has demonstrated deleterious effects of obesity on brain structure and function, the majority of studies have used conventional measures such as waist-to-hip ratio, waist circumference, and body mass index. While sensitive to gross features of body composition, such global anthropomorphic features fail to describe regional differences in body fat distribution and composition, and to determine visceral adiposity, which is related to a range of metabolic conditions. In this mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal design (interval mean and standard deviation = 19.7 ¬± 0.5 months), including 790 healthy individuals (mean (range) age = 46.7 (18-94) years, 53% women), we investigated cross-sectional body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, n = 286) measures of adipose tissue distribution in relation to longitudinal brain structure using MRI-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We estimated tissue-specific brain age at two time points and performed Bayesian multilevel modelling to investigate the associations between adipose measures at follow-up and brain age gap (BAG) at baseline and follow-up. We also tested for interactions between BAG and both time and age on each adipose measure. The results showed credible associations between T1-based BAG and liver fat, muscle fat infiltration (MFI), and weight-to-muscle ratio (WMR), indicating older-appearing brains in people with higher measures of adipose tissue. Longitudinal evidence supported interaction effects between time and MFI and WMR on T1-based BAG, indicating accelerated ageing over the course of the study period in people with higher measures of adipose tissue. The results show that specific measures of fat distribution are associated with brain ageing and that different compartments of adipose tissue may be differentially linked with increased brain ageing, with potential to identify key processes involved in age-related transdiagnostic disease processes.</jats:p>",2021-04-15

In-hospital treatment addresses the multifaceted nature of the illness including viral replication, cytokine storm, and endothelial injury with thrombosis. We identified nine reports of early treatment outcomes in COVID-19 nursing home patients. Multi-drug therapy including hydroxychloroquine with one or more anti-infectives, corticosteroids, and antithrombotic agents can be extended to seniors in the nursing home setting without hospitalization. Data from nine studies found multidrug regimens relying on the use of hydroxychloroquine as well as other agents including doxycycline were associated with a statistically significant and &gt;60% reductions in mortality. Going forward, we theorize and based on the evidence, that early empiric treatment for the elderly with COVID-19 in the nursing home setting (or similar congregated settings with elderly residents/patients) has a genuine probability of success and acceptable safety. This group remains our highest at-risk group and warrants acute treatment focus that will prevent the development and/or worsening of problems associated with COVID-19, most particularly isolation, hospitalization, and death. In fact, with the rapidity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in nursing homes, in-center treatment of patients with acute COVID-19 is possibly the most rational and importantly <jats:italic>feasible</jats:italic> strategy to reduce the risks of hospitalization and death. If the approach remains ‚Äòwait-and-see‚Äô and elderly high-risk patients in such congregated nursing room type settings are allowed to worsen with no early treatment, they may be too sick and fragile to benefit from in-hospital therapeutics and are at risk for pulmonary failure, life-ending micro-thrombi of the lungs, kidneys etc. We put forth the notion that the most important factor in this regard, is making available early therapeutic intervention as described here. These drugs include and under supervision by skilled doctors, combination/sequenced ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, colchicine, azithromycin, doxycycline, bromhexine hydrochloride, and favipiravir (outside the US), along with inhaled steroids such as budesonide and oral steroids including dexamethasone and prednisone, and anti-thrombotic anti-clotting drugs such as heparin). As the clinical trials data on treatments for COVID-19 mature, this early treatment therapeutic option deserves serious, urgent, and sober consideration by the medical establishment and respective decision-makers.</jats:p>",2021-02-01

In most countries, healthcare workers (HCWs) represent a priority group for vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to their elevated risk of COVID-19 and potential contribution to nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Concerns have been raised that HCWs from ethnic minority groups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant (defined by the World Health Organisation as refusing or delaying a vaccination) than those of White ethnicity, but there are limited data on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy and its predictors in UK HCWs.
Methods
Nationwide prospective cohort study and qualitative study in a multi-ethnic cohort of clinical and non-clinical UK HCWs. We analysed ethnic differences in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine hesitancy adjusting for demographics, vaccine trust, and perceived risk of COVID-19. We explored reasons for hesitancy in qualitative data using a framework analysis. 
Findings
11,584 HCWs were included in the cohort analysis. 23% (2704) reported vaccine hesitancy. Compared to White British HCWs (21.3% hesitant), HCWs from Black Caribbean (54.2%), Mixed White and Black Caribbean (38.1%), Black African (34.4%), Chinese (33.1%), Pakistani (30.4%), and White Other (28.7%) ethnic groups were significantly more likely to be hesitant. In adjusted analysis, Black Caribbean (aOR 3.37, 95% CI 2.11 - 5.37), Black African (aOR 2.05, 95% CI 1.49 - 2.82), White Other ethnic groups (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.19 - 1.84) were significantly more likely to be hesitant. Other independent predictors of hesitancy were younger age, female sex, higher score on a COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs scale, lower trust in employer, lack of influenza vaccine uptake in the previous season, previous COVID-19, and pregnancy. Qualitative data from 99 participants identified the following contributors to hesitancy: lack of trust in government and employers, safety concerns due to the speed of vaccine development, lack of ethnic diversity in vaccine studies, and confusing and conflicting information. Participants felt uptake in ethnic minority communities might be improved through inclusive communication, involving HCWs in the vaccine rollout, and promoting vaccination through trusted networks.
Interpretation
Despite increased risk of COVID-19, HCWs from some ethnic minority groups are more likely to be vaccine hesitant than their White British colleagues. Strategies to build trust and dispel myths surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine in these communities are urgently required. Public health communications should be inclusive, non-stigmatising and utilise trusted networks.

The resulting nutrient limitation or restricted access to nutrients pose a major challenge for every organism. While many animals, such as hibernating animals, evolved strategies to overcome periods of nutrient scarcity, the cellular mechanisms of these strategies are poorly understood. Cave environments represent an extreme example of nutrient deprived environments since the lack of sunlight and therefore primary energy production drastically diminishes the nutrient availability. Here, we used Astyanax mexicanus, which includes river-dwelling surface fish and cave adapted cavefish populations to study the genetic adaptation to nutrient limitations. We show that cavefish populations store large amounts of fat in different body regions when fed ad libitum in the lab. We found higher expression of lipogenesis genes in cavefish livers when fed the same amount of food as surface fish, suggesting an improved ability of cavefish to use lipogenesis to convert available energy into triglycerides for storage into adipose tissue. Moreover, the lipid metabolism regulator, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Œ≥ (PparŒ≥), is upregulated at both transcript and protein levels in cavefish livers. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP seq) showed that PparŒ≥ binds cavefish promoter regions of genes to a higher extent than surface fish. Finally, we identified two possible regulatory mechanisms of PparŒ≥ in cavefish: higher amounts of ligands of the nuclear receptor, and nonsense mutations in per2, a known repressor of PparŒ≥.

Using scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy as well as mass spectrometry, we investigate the potential of this inflammagen to interact with platelets and fibrin(ogen) directly to cause blood hypercoagulation. Using platelet poor plasma (PPP), we show that spike protein may interfere with blood flow. Mass spectrometry also showed that when spike protein S1 is added to healthy PPP, it results in structural changes to Œ≤ and Œ≥ fibrin(ogen), complement 3, and prothrombin. These proteins were substantially resistant to trypsinization, in the presence of spike protein S1. Here we suggest that, in part, the presence of spike protein in circulation may contribute to the hypercoagulation in COVID-19 positive patients and may cause substantial impairment of fibrinolysis. Such lytic impairment may result in the persistent large microclots we have noted here and previously in plasma samples of COVID-19 patients.

Mu and Delta opioid receptors (MORs and DORs) can interact when overexpressed in the same cells, but whether co-expression of endogenous MORs and DORs in neurons leads to functional interactions is unclear. Here, we show that both MORs and DORs inhibit parvalbumin-expressing basket cells (PV-BCs) in hippocampal CA1 through partially occlusive signaling pathways that terminate on somato-dendritic potassium channels and presynaptic calcium channels. Using photoactivatable opioid neuropeptides, we find that DORs dominate the response to enkephalin in terms of both ligand-sensitivity and kinetics, which may be due to relatively low expression levels of MOR. Opioid-activated potassium channels do not show heterologous desensitization, indicating that MORs and DORs signal independently. In a direct test for heteromeric functional interactions, the DOR antagonist TIPP-Psi does not alter the kinetics or potency of either the potassium channel or synaptic responses to photorelease of the MOR agonist DAMGO. Thus, despite largely redundant and convergent signaling, MORs and DORs do not functionally interact in PV-BCs. These findings imply that crosstalk between MORs and DORs, either in the form of physical interactions or synergistic intracellular signaling, is not a preordained outcome of co-expression in neurons.</jats:p>",2021-04-24

Transcriptomic analysis indicated inositol production is nonessential but its loss alters BT capsule expression. Bioinformatic and lipidomic comparisons of Bacteroidetes species revealed a novel second putative pathway for bacterial PI synthesis without a PIP intermediate.

PCA outcomes are used to shape study design, identify and characterize individuals and populations, and draw historical and ethnobiological conclusions on origins, evolution, whereabouts, and relatedness. The replicability crisis in science has prompted us to evaluate whether PCA results are reliable, robust, and replicable. We employed an intuitive color-based model alongside human population data for eleven common test cases. We demonstrate that PCA results are artifacts of the data and that they can be easily manipulated to generate desired outcomes. PCA results may not be reliable, robust, or replicable as the field assumes. Our findings raise concerns on the validity of results reported in the literature of population genetics and related fields that place a disproportionate reliance upon PCA outcomes and the insights derived from them.

These results identify how through cortical depth compartmentalization V1 functionally segregates rather than confuses external from internally-generated visual contents. These results indicate that feedforward and feedback manifest in distinct subdivisions of the early visual cortex, thereby reflecting a general strategy for implementing multiple cognitive functions within a single brain region.</jats:p>",2021-04-28

Although great improvements have been done, the sensitivity of the biosensors is still limited by the low photostability and the poor fluorescence performances of YFPs at acidic pHs. In fact, today, there is no yellow variant derived from the EYFP with a pK<jats:sub>1/2</jats:sub> below ‚àº5.5. Here, we characterize a new yellow fluorescent protein, tdLanYFP, derived from the tetrameric protein from the cephalochordate <jats:italic>B. lanceolatum</jats:italic>, LanYFP. With a quantum yield of 0.92 and an extinction coefficient of 133 000 mol<jats:sup>‚àí1</jats:sup>.L.cm<jats:sup>‚àí1</jats:sup>, it is, to our knowledge, the brightest dimeric fluorescent protein available, and brighter than most of the monomeric YFPs. Contrasting with EYFP and its derivatives, tdLanYFP has a very high photostability <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> and preserves this property in live cells. As a consequence, tdLanYFP allows the imaging of cellular structures with sub-diffraction resolution with STED nanoscopy. We also demonstrate that the combination of high brightness and strong photostability is compatible with the use of spectro-microscopies in single molecule regimes. Its very low pK<jats:sub>1/2</jats:sub> of 3.9 makes tdLanYFP an excellent tag even at acidic pHs. Finally, we show that tdLanYFP can be a FRET partner either as donor or acceptor in different biosensing modalities. Altogether, these assets make tdLanYFPa very attractive yellow fluorescent protein for long-term or single-molecule live-cell imaging that is also suitable for FRET experiment including at acidic pH.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

Therefore, a model based on BERT architecture canpotentially overcome such limitations.Results:Here, we propose BERT-RBP as a model to predict RNA-RBP interactions by adapting the BERT architecture pre-trained on a human reference genome.  Our model outperformed state-of-the-art prediction models using the eCLIP-seq data of154 RBPs.  The detailed analysis further revealed that BERT-RBP could recognize both the transcript region type and RNAsecondary structure only from sequential information.

While recent technological advances have enabled unprecedented control over gene expression, many of these approaches are focused on selected model organisms and/or require labor-intensive customization for different applications. The simplicity and modularity of CRISPR-based systems have transformed this aspect of genome editing, providing a variety of possible applications and targets. However, there are currently few available tools for cell-selective CRISPR regulation in neurons. Here, we designed, validated, and optimized CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) systems for Cre recombinase-dependent gene regulation. Unexpectedly, CRISPRa systems based on a traditional double-floxed inverted open reading frame (DIO) strategy exhibited leaky target gene induction in the absence of Cre. Therefore, we developed an intron-containing Cre-dependent CRISPRa system (SVI-DIO-dCas9-VPR) that alleviated leaky gene induction and outperformed the traditional DIO system at endogenous genes in both HEK293T cells and rat primary neuron cultures. Using gene-specific CRISPR sgRNAs, we demonstrate that SVI-DIO-dCas9-VPR can activate highly inducible genes (GRM2, Tent5b, and Fos) as well as moderately inducible genes (Sstr2 and Gadd45b) in a Cre-specific manner. Furthermore, to illustrate the versatility of this tool, we created a parallel CRISPRi construct that successfully inhibited expression from of a luciferase reporter in HEK293T cells only in the presence of Cre. These results provide a robust framework for Cre-dependent CRISPR-dCas9 approaches across different model systems, and will enable cell-specific targeting when combined with common Cre driver lines or Cre delivery via viral vectors.</jats:p>",2020-11-20

These viruses are the etiological agents of several human diseases, including hand-foot-and-mouth disease, neonatal sepsis, encephalitis, meningitis, paralysis and respiratory infections. There is an unmet need for antivirals to treat these diseases. The non-structural protein 2C is a AAA+ ATPase, with reported helicase activity, and plays a key role in viral replication. As such, it is an attractive target for antiviral drug development. Several repurposing screens with FDA-approved drugs have identified 2C-targeting compounds such as fluoxetine and dibucaine, but the molecular basis of 2C inhibition has remained enigmatic. Here we present the 1.5 √Ö resolution crystal structure of the soluble fragment of coxsackievirus B3 2C protein in complex with (S)-fluoxetine (SFX), which reveals a conserved, hydrophobic drug-binding pocket which is distal to the ATP binding site. To decipher the molecular mechanism of inhibition by fluoxetine and other 2C-targeting compounds, we engineered a soluble, hexameric and ATPase competent 2C protein. Using this system, we show that SFX, dibucaine, HBB and guanidine hydrochloride inhibit 2C ATPase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, using cryo-EM analysis, we demonstrate that SFX and dibucaine stabilize 2C in a defined hexameric conformation, rationalising their mode of inhibiton and allowing us to generate the first reconstruction of the oligomeric complex. Taken together, these results provide important structural and mechanistic insights into 2C inhibition and provide a robust engineering strategy which can be used for structural, functional and drug-screening analysis of 2C proteins from current or future enteroviruses.</jats:p>",2021-04-26

Recently, the first genetically encoded reporter molecules were developed based on bacterial gas vesicles to link ultrasound signals to molecular and cellular function.

Here, we describe second-generation ARGs with greatly improved acoustic properties and expression characteristics. We identified these ARGs through a systematic phylogenetic screen of candidate gas vesicle gene clusters from diverse bacteria and archaea. The resulting constructs offer major qualitative and quantitative improvements, including the ability to produce nonlinear ultrasound contrast to distinguish their signals from those of background tissues, and a reduced burden of expression in probiotic hosts. We demonstrate the utility of these next-generation ARGs by imaging the <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> gene expression of tumor-homing probiotic bacteria, revealing the unique spatial distribution of tumor colonization by these cells noninvasively in living subjects.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

In this study we estimate susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to those of adults. Understanding the age-structured transmission dynamics of the outbreak provides precious and timely information to guide epidemic modelling and public health policy.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>Data were collected from households in the city of Bnei Brak, Israel, in which all household members were tested for COVID-19 using PCR. To estimate relative transmission parameters in the absence of data on who infected whom, we developed an estimation method based on a discrete stochastic dynamic model of the spread of the epidemic within a household. The model describes the propagation of the disease between household members allowing for susceptibility and infectivity parameters to vary among two age groups. The parameter estimates are obtained by a maximum likelihood method, where the likelihood function is computed based on the stochastic model via simulations.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Inspection of the data reveals that children are less likely to become infected compared to adults (25% of children infected over all households, 44% of adults infected over all households, excluding index cases), and the chances of becoming infected increases with age. An interesting exception is that infants up to age one year are more likely to be infected than children between one and four. Using our modelling approach, we estimate that the susceptibility of children (under 20 years old) is 45% [40%, 55%] of the susceptibility of adults. The infectivity of children was estimated to be 85% [65%, 110%] relative to that of adults.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Interpretation</jats:title><jats:p>It is widely observed that the percentage of children within confirmed cases is low. A common explanation is that children who are infected are less likely to develop symptoms than adults, and thus are less likely to be tested. We estimate that children are less susceptible to infection, which is an additional factor explaining their relatively low rate of occurrence within confirmed cases. Moreover, our results indicate that children, when infected, are somewhat less prone to infect others compared to adults; however, this result is not statistically significant.</jats:p><jats:p>The resulting estimates of susceptibility and infectivity of children compared to adults are crucial for deciding on appropriate interventions, and for controlling the epidemic outbreak and its progress. These estimates can guide age-dependent public health policy such as school closure and opening. However, while our estimates of children‚Äôs susceptibility and infectivity are lower than those of adults within a household, it is important to bear in mind that their role in the spread of COVID-19 outside the household, is also affected by different contact patterns and hygiene habits.</jats:p></jats:sec>",2020-06-05

Modern neuroimaging research increasingly depends on identifying correspondences between the topographies of these maps; however, most standard methods for statistical inference fail to account for their spatial properties. Recently, multiple methods have been developed to generate null distributions that preserve the spatial autocorrelation of brain maps and yield more accurate statistical estimates. Here, we comprehensively assess the performance of ten published null frameworks in statistical analyses of neuroimaging data. To test the efficacy of these frameworks in situations with a known ground truth, we first apply them to a series of controlled simulations and examine the impact of data resolution and spatial autocorrelation on their family-wise error rates. Next, we use each framework with two empirical neuroimaging datasets, investigating their performance when testing (1) the correspondence between brain maps (e.g., correlating two activation maps) and (2) the spatial distribution of a feature within a partition (e.g., quantifying the specificity of an activation map within an intrinsic functional network). Finally, we investigate how differences in the implementation of these null models may impact their performance. In agreement with previous reports, we find that naive null models that do not preserve spatial autocorrelation consistently yield elevated false positive rates and unrealistically liberal statistical estimates. While spatially-constrained null models yielded more realistic, conservative estimates, even these frameworks suffer from inflated false positive rates and variable performance across analyses. Throughout our results, we observe minimal impact of parcellation and resolution on null model performance.

While Magnetic and ElectroEncephaloGraphic (MEEG) data are often averaged across trials per condition, it is becoming common practice to use information from all trials to build linear models. Individual trials can, however, have considerable weight and thus bias inferential results. Here, rather than looking for univariate outliers, defined independently at each measurement point, we apply the principal component projection (PCP) method at each channel, deriving a single weight per trial at each channel independently. Using both synthetic data and open EEG data, we show (1) that PCP is efficient at detecting a large variety of outlying trials; (2) how PCP-based weights can be implemented in the context of the general linear model with accurate control of type 1 family-wise error rate; and (3) that our PCP-based Weighted Least Square (WLS) approach increases the statistical power of group analyses as well as a much slower Iterative Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS), although the weighting scheme is markedly different.

Usually done manually, this task can beneficiate from advances in image analysis technics. Automated detection of individual plants in images is a key step to estimate this density. To develop and evaluate dedicated processing technics, high resolution RGB images were acquired from UAVs during several years and experiments over maize, sugar beet and sunflower crops at early stages. A total of 16247 plants have been labelled interactively. We compared the performances of handcrafted method (HC) to those of deep-learning (DL). HC method consists in segmenting the image into green and background pixels, identifying rows, then objects corresponding to plants thanks to knowledge of the sowing pattern as prior information. DL method is based on  the Faster RCNN model trained over 2/3 of the images selected to represent a good balance between plant development stage and sessions. One model is trained for each crop.
Results show that DL generally outperforms HC, particularly for maize and sunflower crops. The quality of images appears mandatory for HC methods where image blur and complex background induce difficulties for the segmentation step. Performances of DL methods are also limited by image quality as well as the presence of weeds. An hybrid method (HY) was proposed to eliminate weeds between the rows using the rules used for the HC method. HY improves slightly DL performances in the case of high weed infestation. A significant level of variability of plant detection performances is observed between the several experiments. This was explained by the variability of image acquisition conditions including illumination, plant development stage, background complexity and weed infestation. We tested an active learning approach where few images corresponding to the conditions of the testing dataset were complementing the training dataset for DL. Results show a drastic increase of performances for all crops, with relative RMSE below 5% for the estimation of the plant density.</jats:p>",2021-04-28

Here, we investigated if a high oral dose of a mixture of Combined Metabolic Activators (CMA) can restore metabolic function and thus aid the recovery of COVID-19 patients. We conducted a placebo-controlled, open-label phase 2 study and a double-blinded phase 3 clinical trials to investigate the time of symptom-free recovery on ambulatory patients using a mixture of CMA consisting of NAD+ and glutathione precursors. The results of both studies showed that the time to complete recovery was significantly shorter in the CMA group (6.6 vs 9.3 days) in phase 2 and (5.7 vs 9.2 days) in phase 3 trials. A comprehensive analysis of the blood metabolome and proteome showed that the plasma levels of proteins and metabolites associated with inflammation and antioxidant metabolism are significantly improved in patients treated with the metabolic activators as compared to placebo. The results show that treating patients infected with COVID-19 with a high dose of CMAs leads to a more rapid symptom-free recovery, suggesting a role for such a therapeutic regime in the treatment of infections leading to respiratory problems.</jats:p>",2020-10-05

Understanding those effects is critical for anticipating and mitigating epidemic spread. Ambient temperature and humidity strongly affect the inactivation rate of enveloped viruses, but a mechanistic, quantitative theory of those effects has been elusive. We measure the stability of the enveloped respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 on an inert surface at nine temperature and humidity conditions and develop a mechanistic model to explain and predict how temperature and humidity alter virus inactivation. We find SARS-CoV-2 survives longest at low temperatures and extreme relative humidities; median estimated virus half-life is over 24 hours at 10 ¬∞C and 40 % RH, but approximately 1.5 hours at 27 ¬∞C and 65 % RH. Our mechanistic model uses simple chemistry to explain the increase in virus inactivation rate with increased temperature and the U-shaped dependence of inactivation rate on relative humidity. The model accurately predicts quantitative measurements from existing studies of five different human coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2), suggesting that shared mechanisms may determine environmental stability for many enveloped viruses. Our results indicate scenarios of particular transmission risk, point to pandemic mitigation strategies, and open new frontiers in the mechanistic study of virus transmission.</jats:p>",2020-10-16

Although antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike have been shown prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, the effects of antibodies against other spike protein domains are largely unknown. Here, we screened a series of anti-spike monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients, and found that some of antibodies against the N-terminal domain (NTD) dramatically enhanced the binding capacity of the spike protein to ACE2, and thus increased SARS-CoV2 infectivity. Surprisingly, mutational analysis revealed that all the infectivity-enhancing antibodies recognized a specific site on the surface of the NTD. The antibodies against this infectivity-enhancing site were detected in all samples of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the study. However, the ratio of infectivity-enhancing antibodies to neutralizing antibodies differed among patients. Furthermore, the antibodies against the infectivity-enhancing site were detected in 3 out of 48 uninfected donors, albeit at low levels. These findings suggest that the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity-enhancing site could be considered as a possible exacerbating factors for COVID-19 and that a spike protein lacking such antibody epitopes may be required for safe vaccine development, especially for individuals with pre-existing enhancing antibodies.</jats:p>",2020-12-18

Emerging mutations can affect viral properties such as infectivity and immune resistance. Although the sensitivity of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants to humoral immunity has recently been investigated, that to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted cellular immunity remains unaddressed. Here we demonstrate that two recently emerging mutants in the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, L452R (in B.1.427/429) and Y453F (in B.1.298), can escape from the HLA-24-restricted cellular immunity. These mutations reinforce the affinity to viral receptor ACE2, and notably, the L452R mutation increases protein stability, viral infectivity, and potentially promotes viral replication. Our data suggest that the HLA-restricted cellular immunity potentially affects the evolution of viral phenotypes, and the escape from cellular immunity can be a further threat of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Graphical Abstract</jats:title><jats:fig id=""ufig1"" position=""float"" orientation=""portrait"" fig-type=""figure""><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""438288v1_ufig1"" position=""float"" orientation=""portrait"" /></jats:fig></jats:sec>",2021-04-05

However, such diseases are also largely influenced by environmental insults and lifestyle factors, which are thought to be captured by epigenetic modifications. DNA methylation encodes information on the epigenetic landscape of an individual, regulates gene transcription, and can be reflected in the variability of the proteome. Protein biomarkers that predict or correlate with disease onset have been identified across many age-related morbidities; however, the extent of epigenetic influence in these pathways is often unclear. Here, we report a comprehensive epigenome-wide study of the circulating proteome. Using data from four independent cohort studies, we train and test epigenetic scores (EpiScores) for 953 plasma proteins, identifying 109 robust signatures that explain between 1% and 58% of the variance after adjusting for genetic effects. These EpiScores are then linked to the incidence of 12 leading morbidities over 14 years of follow up in the Generation Scotland cohort (n=9,537). After adjustment for common risk factors, 137 EpiScore - incident disease associations are revealed, several of which are confirmed by previously identified associations with measured protein levels. Notably, 21 EpiScores that associate with incident diabetes replicate previous protein associations with incident (n=12 proteins) and prevalent (n=21 proteins) diabetes. Complementary to polygenic scores, these epigenetic scores for protein levels are therefore likely to capture the environmental components of disease risk and can be a valuable resource for disease prediction, stratification and biomarker discovery.</jats:p>",2020-12-02

A key step in solving this long-standing paradox is to determine the genetic architecture of sexually-selected traits to understand evolutionary drivers and constraints at the genomic level. Antlers are a form of sexual weaponry in male red deer. On the island of Rum, Scotland, males with larger antlers have increased breeding success, yet there has been no response to selection observed at the genetic level. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of this observation, we investigate the genetic architecture of ten antler traits and their principle components using genomic data from &gt;38,000 SNPs. We estimate the heritabilities and genetic correlations of the antler traits using a genomic relatedness approach. We then use genome-wide association and haplotype-based regional heritability to identify regions of the genome underlying antler morphology, and an Empirical Bayes approach to estimate the underlying distributions of allele effect sizes. We show that antler morphology is heritable with a polygenic architecture, highly repeatable over an individual‚Äôs lifetime, and that almost all aspects are positively genetically correlated with some loci identified as having pleiotropic effects. Our findings suggest that a large mutational target and pleiotropy with traits sharing similar complex polygenic architectures are likely to contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation in antler morphology in this population.</jats:p>",2021-04-18

Due to its high sensitivity and specificity, RT-qPCR is the 'gold standard' method for this purpose. However, its technical requirements, processing time and elevated costs hamper its use towards massive and timely molecular testing for COVID-19 in rural and socioeconomically deprived areas of Latin America. The advent and rapid evolution of CRISPR-Cas technology has boosted the development of new pathogen detection methodologies. Recently, DETECTR-a combination of isothermal RT-LAMP amplification and Cas12a-mediated enzymatic detection- has been successfully validated in the Netherlands and the USA as a rapid and low-cost alternative to RT-qPCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Here, we evaluated the performance of RCSMS, a locally adapted variant of DETECTR, to ascertain the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples from 276 patients in two hospitals in Lima, Peru (current status over a total of 350 samples). We show that a low-cost thermochemical treatment with TCEP/EDTA is sufficient to inactivate viral particles and cellular nucleases in saliva, eliminating the need to extract viral RNA with commercial kits, as well as the cumbersome nasopharyngeal swab procedure and the requirement of biosafety level 2 laboratories for molecular analyses. Our clinical validation shows that RCSMS detects up to 5 viral copies per reaction in 40 min, with sensitivity and specificity of 93.8% and 99.0% in the field, respectively, relative to RT-qPCR. Since CRISPR-Cas biosensors can be easily reprogrammed by using different guide RNA molecules, RCSMS has the potential to be quickly adapted for the detection of new SARS-CoV-2 variants. Notably, estimation of its negative and positive predictive values suggests that RCSMS can be confidently deployed in both high and low prevalence settings. Furthermore, our field study validates the use of lateral flow strips to easily visualize the presence of SARS-CoV-2, which paves the way to deploy RCSMS as a 'point of care' test in environments with limited access to state-of-the-art diagnostic laboratories. In sum, RCSMS is a fast, efficient and inexpensive alternative to RT-qPCR for expanding COVID-19 testing capacity in low- and middle-income countries.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

Advances in synthetic biology may help address these challenges by engineering biological systems to perform new functions such as biomanufacturing of high-value compounds from low-value waste streams and bioremediation of industrial pollutants. However, the current emphasis on microbial systems for biomanufacturing, which often require highly pre-processed inputs and sophisticated infrastructure, is not feasible for many waste streams. Meanwhile, concerns about transgene biocontainment have limited the release of engineered microbes or plants for bioremediation.
Engineering animals may provide opportunities for utilizing various waste streams that are not suitable for microbial biomanufacturing while effective transgene biocontainment options should enable in situ bioremediation. Here, we engineer the model insect Drosophila melanogaster to express a functional laccase from the fungus Trametes trogii. Laccase expressing flies reduced bisphenol A by more than 50% when present in their growth media, while a lyophilized powder made from engineered adult flies degraded more than 90% of bisphenol A and indigo carmine in aqueous solutions.

We manually validate the data, address limitations in modelling from previous studies, and extensively test the robustness of our estimates. The combined effect of all NPIs was smaller relative to estimates from the first half of 2020, indicating the strong influence of safety measures and individual protective behaviours--such as distancing--that persisted after the first wave. Closing specific businesses was highly effective. Gathering restrictions were highly effective but only for the strictest limits. We find smaller effects for closing educational institutions compared to the first wave, suggesting that safer operation of schools was possible with a set of stringent safety measures including testing and tracing, preventing mixing, and smaller classes.

We highlight vitamin D‚Äôs direct effect on the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS), which in concert with its other effects, can modify host responses thus preventing a cytokine storm and SARS-CoV-2-induced pathological changes.

The data set size, supporting historical, biomolecular, and emerging clinical research evidence altogether suggest that a very high level of confidence is justified. Vitamin D prophylaxis offers a widely available, low-risk, highly-scalable, and cost-effective pandemic management strategy including the mitigation of local outbreaks and a second wave. Timely implementation of vitamin D supplementation programmes worldwide is critical; initial priority should be given to those who are at the highest risk, including the elderly, immobile, homebound, BAME and healthcare professionals. Population-wide vitamin D sufficiency could prevent seasonal respiratory epidemics, decrease our dependence on pharmaceutical solutions, reduce hospitalisations, and thus greatly lower healthcare costs while significantly increasing quality of life.</jats:p></jats:sec>",2020-05-06

The proportion reporting anosmia/ageusia increased at antibody titres below diagnostic thresholds for both an in-house ELISA and the Abbott Architect chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA): 424/903(47%) reported anosmia/ageusia with a positive ELISA, 59/387(13.2%) with high-negative titres, and 324/7943(4.1%) with low-negative results.

What this diversity reflects is unclear, and appears counter-productive in generating selective somatic responses to specific stimuli. We propose that synaptic diversity arises because neurons decode information from upstream populations. Focusing on a single sensory variable, orientation, we construct a probabilistic decoder that estimates the stimulus orientation from the responses of a realistic, hypothetical input population of neurons. We provide a straightforward mapping from the decoder weights to real excitatory synapses, and find that optimal decoding requires diverse input weights. Analytically derived weights exhibit diversity whenever upstream input populations consist of noisy, correlated, and heterogeneous neurons, as is typically found in vivo. In fact, in silico weight diversity was necessary to accurately decode orientation and matched the functional heterogeneity of dendritic spines imaged in vivo. Our results indicate that synaptic diversity is a necessary component of information transmission and reframes studies of connectivity through the lens of probabilistic population codes. These results suggest that the mapping from synaptic inputs to somatic selectivity may not be directly interpretable without considering input covariance and highlights the importance of population codes in pursuit of the cortical connectome.</jats:p>",2020-10-15

From a combination of experiments and molecular simulations we reveal here how Oct4, the master regulator and inducer of cellular pluripotency, interprets and enhances nucleosome structural flexibility. The magnitude of Oct4 impact on nucleosome dynamics depends on the binding site position and the mobility of unstructured tails of nucleosomal histone proteins. Oct4 propagates and stabilizes open nucleosome conformations by specific sequence recognition and unspecific DNA exploration. Our findings provide a structural basis for the versatility of transcription factors in engaging with nucleosomes and have implications for understanding how pioneer factors induce chromatin dynamics.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

Two common types of permutations each have limitations. Pre-network (datastream) permutations can be used to control ""nuisance effects"" like spatial, temporal, or sampling biases, but only when the null hypothesis assumes random social decisions. Node (node-label) permutation tests can test null hypotheses that include nonrandom social structure, but only when the observed network is not shaped by nuisance effects. We propose a new procedure, the double permutation test, that addresses these limitations by combining pre-network and node permutations. We conduct a range of simulations, allowing us to estimate error rates caused by confounding effects of social or non-social structure in the raw data. We show that the double permutation test is less likely to produce elevated error rates relative to node permutations, pre-network permutations, and regression models with control variables, which all exhibit elevated type I errors under at least one set of simulated conditions. In scenarios where type I error rates from pre-network permutation tests exceed 30%, the error rates from double permutation remain close to 5%. The double permutation test provides a potential solution to issues arising from elevated type I and type II error rates when testing hypotheses with social network data. We also discuss other approaches for more robust inferences, including controlled node permutations, testing multiple null hypotheses, and splitting large datasets to generate replicated networks. Finally, we highlight ways that uncertainty can be explicitly considered and carried through the analysis.</jats:p>",2020-08-04

Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits both membrane-bound and soluble IL6R and is used to treat inflammatory conditions, including COVID-19. Despite the disproportionate incidence of COVID-19 among underserved, racial, and ethnic minority populations, the efficacy of tocilizumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients from these populations is unclear. In this work, three genetic markers for the <jats:italic>IL6R</jats:italic> gene were analyzed across diverse ethnic backgrounds to identify population differences in response to tocilizumab treatment. Genetic structure analyses showed that African populations were significantly different from other described populations. In addition, mapped frequencies of these alleles showed that Sub-Saharan African populations were 3.4x more likely to show an impaired response to tocilizumab than East Asian populations, and 1.8x more likely than European ancestry populations. Existing <jats:italic>IL6R</jats:italic> genotype results may identify populations at increased therapeutic failure risk. As results from current clinical trials on the efficacy of tocilizumab treatment for extreme COVID-19 infections are conflicting, more studies are needed across diverse patient backgrounds to better understand the genetic factors necessary to predict treatment efficacy. This work demonstrates how pharmacogenomics studies can elucidate genetic variation on treatment efficacy on COVID-19.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

Here, we make use of several long highly expressed genes and demonstrate that they form transcription loops with polymerases moving along the loops and carrying nascent RNAs. Transcription loops can span across microns resembling lampbrush loops and polytene puffs. Extension and shape of transcription loops suggest their intrinsic stiffness, which we attribute to decoration with multiple voluminous nascent RNPs.

Though a considerable amount of work has described the molecular profiles that define motor neurons, OPCs, and oligodendrocytes, less is known about the progenitors that produce them. To identify the developmental origins and transcriptional profiles of motor neurons and OPCs, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on isolated pMN cells from embryonic zebrafish trunk tissue at stages that encompassed motor neurogenesis, OPC specification, and initiation of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Downstream analyses revealed two distinct pMN progenitor populations: one that appears to produce neurons and one that appears to produce OPCs. This latter population, called Pre-OPCs, is marked by expression of GS Homeobox 2 (gsx2), a gene that encodes a homeobox transcription factor. Using fluorescent in situ hybridizations, we identified gsx2-expressing Pre-OPCs in the spinal cord prior to expression of canonical OPC marker genes.

Notably, modern human genomes contain evolutionary information tracing back tens of thousands of years, which may help identify the viruses that have impacted our ancestors ‚Äì pointing to which viruses have future pandemic potential. Here, we apply evolutionary analyses to human genomic datasets to recover selection events involving tens of human genes that interact with coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, that likely started more than 20,000 years ago. These adaptive events were limited to the population ancestral to East Asian populations. Multiple lines of functional evidence support an ancient viral selective pressure, and East Asia is the geographical origin of several modern coronavirus epidemics. An arms race with an ancient coronavirus, or with a different virus that happened to use similar interactions as coronaviruses with human hosts, may thus have taken place in ancestral East Asian populations. By learning more about our ancient viral foes, our study highlights the promise of evolutionary information to better predict the pandemics of the future. Importantly, adaptation to ancient viral epidemics in specific human populations does not necessarily imply any difference in genetic susceptibility between different human populations, and the current evidence points toward an overwhelming impact of socioeconomic factors in the case of COVID-19.</jats:p>",2020-11-16

Associated ASD biomarkers can be supportive of apprehending the underlying roots of the disease and lead the targeted diagnosis as well as treatment. Although deep learning approaches have been applied in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based clinical or behavioral identification of ASD, most erstwhile models are inadequate in their capacity to exploit the data richness. Classification techniques often solely rely on region-based summary and/or functional connectivity analysis of one pipeline or unique site dataset. Besides these, biomedical data modeling to analyze big data related to ASD is still perplexing due to its complexity and heterogeneity. Single volume image consideration has not been previously investigated in classification purposes. By deeming these challenges, in this work, firstly, we design an image generator to generate single volume brain images from the whole-brain image of each subject. Secondly, the single volume images are analyzed by evaluating four deep learning approaches comprising one amended volume base Convolutional Neural Network framework to classify ASD and typical control participants. Thirdly, we propose a novel deep ensemble learning classifier using VGG16 as feature extractor to ensure further classification performance. Then, to evaluate the classifier performance across the inter sites, we apply the proposed method on each site individually and validate our findings by comparing literature reports. We showcase our approaches on large-scale multi-site brain imaging dataset (ABIDE) by considering four preprocessing pipelines, and the outcome demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance compared with the literature findings; hence, which are robust and consistent.</jats:p>",2019-09-09

Here, we ask how the uniform activation of an oncogene, RAS, impacts the morphology and tissue mechanics in a normal epithelium. We found that inducible induction of HRAS in confined epithelial monolayers on soft substrates drives a morphological transformation of a 2D monolayer into a compact 3D cell aggregate. This transformation was initiated by the loss of monolayer integrity and formation of two distinct cell layers with differential cell-cell junctions, cell-substrate adhesion, and tensional states. Computational modelling revealed how adhesion and active peripheral tension induces inherent mechanical instability in the system, which drives the 2D to 3D morphological transformation. Consistent with this, removal of epithelial tension through the inhibition of acto-myosin contractility halted the process. These findings reveal the mechanisms by which oncogene activation within an epithelium can induce mechanical instability to drive morphological tissue transformation.</jats:p>",2021-01-20

Suitable measures to prevent such infections are imperative, especially in situations when a high number of persons convene in closed rooms. Here we tested the efficiency and practicability of operating four air purifiers equipped with HEPA filters in a high school classroom while regular classes were taking place. We monitored the aerosol number concentration for particles &gt; 3 nm at two locations in the room, the aerosol size distribution in the range from 10 nm to 10 ¬µm, PM<jats:sub>10</jats:sub> and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration. For comparison, we performed similar measurements in a neighboring classroom without purifiers.

The reduction was homogeneous throughout the room and for all particle sizes. The measurements are supplemented by a calculation estimating the maximum concentration levels of virus-containing aerosol from a highly contagious person speaking in a closed room with and without air purifiers. Measurements and calculation demonstrate that air purifiers potentially represent a well-suited measure to reduce the risks of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 substantially.

However, a stringent significance threshold is required to identify robust genetic associations. Leveraging relevant auxiliary covariates has the potential to boost statistical power to exceed the significance threshold. Particularly, abundant pleiotropy and the non-random distribution of SNPs across various functional categories suggests that leveraging GWAS test statistics from related traits and/or functional genomic data may boost GWAS discovery. While type 1 error rate control has become standard in GWAS, control of the false discovery rate can be a more powerful approach. The conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) extends the standard FDR framework by conditioning on auxiliary data to call significant associations, but current implementations are restricted to auxiliary data satisfying specific parametric distributions, typically GWAS $p$-values for related traits. We relax these distributional assumptions, enabling an extension of the cFDR framework that supports auxiliary covariates from arbitrary continuous distributions (""Flexible cFDR""). Our method can be applied iteratively, thereby supporting multi-dimensional covariate data. Through simulations we show that Flexible cFDR increases sensitivity whilst controlling FDR after one or several iterations. We further demonstrate its practical potential through application to an asthma GWAS, leveraging various functional genomic data to find additional genetic associations for asthma, which we validate in the larger, independent, UK Biobank data resource.</jats:p>",2020-12-04

Multiple founders are crossed to create a rich mosaic of highly recombined founder genomes in the MAGIC recombinant inbred lines (RILs). Many variations of MAGIC population designs exist; however, a large proportion of the currently available populations have been created empirically and based on similar designs. In our evaluations of five MAGIC populations, we found that the choice of designs has a large impact on the recombination landscape in the RILs. The most popular design used in many MAGIC populations has been shown to have a bias in recombinant haplotypes and low level of unique recombinant haplotypes, and therefore is not recommended. To address this problem and provide a remedy for the future, we have developed the ‚Äúmagicdesign‚Äù R package for creating and testing any MAGIC population design via simulation. A Shiny app version of the package is available as well. Our ‚Äúmagicdesign‚Äù package provides a unifying tool and a framework for creativity and innovation in MAGIC population designs. For example, using this package, we demonstrate that MAGIC population designs can be found which are very effective in creating haplotype diversity without the requirement for very large crossing programmes. Further, we show that interspersing cycles of crossing with cycles of selfing is effective in increasing haplotype diversity. These approaches are applicable in species which are hard to cross or in which resources are limited.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

In particular, we describe and analyse three alternative biomolecular topologies that work as signal differentiators of high accuracy to arbitrary input signals around their nominal operation. We propose strategies to preserve their performance even in the presence of high-frequency input signal components, which are detrimental to the performance of most differentiators. We found that the core of the proposed topologies appears in natural regulatory networks and we further discuss their biological relevance.

To experimentally corroborate the possibility of viral retro-integration, we describe evidence that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs can be reverse transcribed in human cells by reverse transcriptase (RT) from LINE-1 elements or by HIV-1 RT, and that these DNA sequences can be integrated into the cell genome and subsequently be transcribed. Human endogenous LINE-1 expression was induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection or by cytokine exposure in cultured cells, suggesting a molecular mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 retro-integration in patients.

This inferred mode of energy conservation is predicted to be enhanced by genetic code expansions, i.e. recoding, allowing the incorporation of the rare 21st and 22nd amino acids selenocysteine (Sec) and pyrrolysine (Pyl). We found Sec recoding in Jordarchaeia and all other Asgardarchaeota classes, which likely benefit from increased catalytic activities of Sec-containing enzymes. Pyl recoding on the other hand is restricted to Hodarchaeia in the Asgardarchaeota, making it the first reported non-methanogenic lineage with an inferred complete Pyl machinery, likely providing this class with an efficient mechanism for methylamine utilisation.

Exposure to a novel environment rapidly initiated a dramatic increase in the rate, size and duration of beta bursts. Additionally, theta-beta cross-frequency coupling was significantly higher during novelty, and spiking of neurons in the RSC was significantly enhanced during beta bursts. Finally, aberrant beta bursting was seen in J20 mice, including increased beta bursting during novelty and familiarity, yet a loss of coupling between beta bursts and spiking activity. These findings, support the concept that beta bursting may be responsible for the activation and reactivation of neuronal ensembles underpinning the formation and maintenance of cortical representations, and that disruptions to this activity in J20 mice may underlie cognitive impairments seen in these animals.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

As an asymmetric homodimer undergoing an ‚Äúalternating access‚Äù protomer-swap conformational change, it serves as a model for the mechanistic understanding of more complex drug transporters. Here, we present a free energy and solvent accessibility analysis that indicates the presence of two complementary ligand translocation pathways that remain operative in a broad range of conditions. Our simulations show a previously undescribed desolvated apo state and anticorrelated accessibility in the ligand-bound state, explaining on a structural level why EmrE does not disrupt the pH gradient through futile proton transfer. By comparing the behavior of a number of model charged and/or aromatic ligands, we also explain the origin of selectivity of EmrE towards a broad class of aromatic cations.

However, relatively little is known in terms of general principles driving their evolution, particularly in the marine realm. In this study we explore several fundamental properties regarding the evolution of reef fish latitudinal ranges, namely the degree of similarity in range size between ancestor and descendant lineages (i.e. phylogenetic signal); the evolution of range limits; and the latitudinal distribution of range sizes, particularly with respect to Rapoport's rule. Location: Global. Taxon: Reef-associated fishes. Methods: We integrate data on the latitudinal distribution and evolutionary history of 5,071 reef fish species with phylogenetic comparative methods to assess the level of phylogenetic signal in latitudinal range size, low- and high-latitude limits, and range midpoints, and to estimate rates of evolution of those traits. Finally, we test whether latitudinal ranges become smaller near the equator, as predicted by Rapoport's rule, using phylogenetic generalized least squares. Results: There were varying levels of phylogenetic signal in latitudinal range size, low- and high-latitude limits, and range midpoints. Despite these differences, latitudinal midpoints were consistently shown to have the highest phylogenetic signal among all measured geographic features. Interestingly, the position of high-latitude limits in general evolved at substantially faster rates than their low-latitude counterparts. Finally, we confirm for the first time the existence of an inverse Rapoport's rule in reef-associated fishes using phylogenetic comparative methods. Indeed, mean latitudinal range size of tropical species is nearly twice the size of their temperate counterparts (2067+-1431 km vs. 1168+-725 km, respectively). Main conclusions: We uncovered several congruent patterns in phylogenetic signal and rates of evolution of latitudinal ranges, despite vastly disparate biogeographical distributions and ecological differences between the studied fish lineages. Such broad congruence across different taxa and oceans, as well as with previous data from terrestrial environments, suggests that the observed patterns might represent general principles governing geographical range evolution.</jats:p>",2020-11-04

However, navigation is a rich behavior that contains a mix of memory-guided and memory-independent strategies. Disentangling the contribution of these strategies to navigation is therefore critical for understanding how memory influences behavioral output. To address this issue, we studied the natural spatial behavior of the chickadee, a food-caching bird. These birds hide food items at concealed, scattered locations and retrieve their caches later in time. We designed an apparatus that allows chickadees to cache and retrieve food while navigating in a laboratory arena. This apparatus enabled detailed, automated, and high-throughput tracking of key behavioral variables ‚Äì including caches, retrievals, and investigations of cache sites. We built probabilistic models to fit these behavioral data using a combination of various mnemonic and non-mnemonic factors. We find that chickadees use some navigational strategies that are independent of cache memories, including opportunistic foraging and spatial biases. They combine these strategies with spatially precise and long-lasting memories of which sites contain caches and which sites they have previously checked and found to be empty. These memories are used in a context-dependent manner. During caching, chickadees avoid sites that already contain food. During retrieval, they are instead attracted to such occupied sites. These results show that a single memory can be used flexibly by a chickadee to achieve at least two unrelated behavioral goals. Our apparatus enables studying this flexibility in a tractable spatial paradigm.</jats:p>",2021-04-23

Attenuation of ŒîNS1 influenza viruses is due to their high IFN inducing properties, that limit their replication in vivo.  This study demonstrates that pre-treatment with a ŒîNS1 virus results in an immediate antiviral state which prevents subsequent replication of homologous and heterologous viruses, preventing disease from virus respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2.

Creatine metabolism was previously shown to critically regulate colon cancer progression.

RGX-202 suppressed tumor growth across KRAS wild-type and KRAS mutant xenograft, syngeneic and patient-derived xenograft colorectal cancers. Anti-tumor efficacy correlated with tumoral expression of creatine kinase B. Combining RGX-202 with 5- fluorouracil or the DHODH inhibitor leflunomide caused regressions of multiple colorectal xenograft and PDX tumors of distinct mutational backgrounds. RGX-202 also perturbed creatine metabolism in metastatic CRC patients enrolled in a Phase-1 trial, mirroring pharmacodynamic effects on creatine metabolism observed in mice. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of pre-clinical and human pharmacodynamic activity for creatine metabolism targeting in oncology, revealing a critical target for CRC.</jats:p>",2021-04-26

The need to improve the quality of community mental health services for people with Complex Emotional Needs (CEN) is recognised internationally and has become a renewed policy priority in England. Such improvement requires positive engagement from clinicians across the service system, and their perspectives on achieving good practice need to be understood. 

Aim
To synthesise qualitative evidence on clinician perspectives on what constitutes good practice, and what helps or prevents it being achieved, in community mental health services for people with CEN.

Methods
Six bibliographic databases were searched for studies published since 2003 and supplementary citation tracking was conducted. Studies that used any recognised qualitative method and reported clinician experiences and perspectives on community-based mental health services for adults with CEN were eligible for this review, including generic and specialist settings. Meta-synthesis was used to generate and synthesise over-arching themes across included studies. 

Results
Twenty-nine papers were eligible for inclusion. Six over-arching themes were identified: 1. The use and misuse of diagnosis; 2. The patient journey into services: nowhere to go; 3. Therapeutic relationships: connection and distance; 4. The nature of treatment: not doing too much or too little; 5. Managing safety issues and crises: being measured and proactive; 6. Clinician and wider service needs: whose needs are they anyway? The overall quality of the evidence was moderate.

Discussion
Through summarising the literature on clinician perspectives on good practice for people with CEN, over-arching priorities were identified on which there appears to be substantial consensus. In their focus on needs such as for a long-term perspective on treatment journeys, high quality and consistent therapeutic relationships, and a balanced approach to safety, clinician priorities are mainly congruent with those found in studies on service user views. They also identify clinician needs that should be met for good care to be provided, including for supervision, joint working and organisational support.</jats:p>",2020-12-16

We first updated estimates of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions from livestock and livestock feed production. We used these data, along with recent estimates of the atmospheric carbon dioxide that could be converted by photosynthesis into perennial biomass on land currently engaged in animal agriculture, to develop models of net anthropogenic emissions under food-system scenarios ranging from ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù to the complete elimination of animal agriculture. We then used simple simulations to project atmospheric levels of these three gases through the end of the century under each scenario. Using cumulative differences in radiative forcing as a measure of the impact of different diets, we found that a gradual transition over the next 15 years to a plant-only diet would have the same effect through the rest of the century as an annual reduction of 28 Gt of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. This would effectively negate 56 percent of global emissions at the current rate of 50 Gt CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>eq per year, with a net negation of 2,200 gigatonnes of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions by the year 2100. The climate benefits would accrue rapidly - most in the first few decades, effectively pausing greenhouse-gas accumulation for 30 years. These results establish the magnitude and the timescale of the positive climate impact that would accrue from eliminating, or significantly reducing, the emissions and land footprints of animal agriculture. How to orchestrate the dietary and agricultural shifts needed to accomplish this in a way that maximizes the beneficial environmental, public health, food security, economic and social consequences and minimizes potential harms should therefore be at the center of climate policy discussions.</jats:p>",2021-04-15

The members of the seed microbiome are the first to colonize a germinating seedling, and they initiate the trajectory of microbiome assembly for the next plant generation. Therefore, the members of the seed microbiome are important for the dynamics of plant microbiome assembly and the vertical transmission of potentially beneficial symbionts. However, it remains challenging to assess the microbiome at the individual seed level (and, therefore, for the future individual plant) due to low endophytic microbial biomass, seed exudates that can select for particular members, and high plant and plastid contamination of resulting reads. Here, we report a protocol for extracting metagenomic DNA from an individual seed (common bean, <jats:italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</jats:italic> L.) with minimal disruption of host tissue, which we expect to be generalizable to other medium-and large-seed plant species. We applied this protocol to quantify the 16S rRNA V4 and ITS2 amplicon composition and variability for individual seeds harvested from replicate common bean plants grown under standard, controlled conditions to maintain health. Using metagenomic DNA extractions from individual seeds, we compared seed-to-seed, pod-to-pod, and plant-to-plant microbiomes, and found highest microbiome variability at the plant level. This suggests that several seeds from the same plant could be pooled for microbiome assessment, given experimental designs that apply treatments at the maternal plant level. This study adds protocols and insights to the growing toolkit of approaches to understand the plant-microbiome engagements that support the health of agricultural and environmental ecosystems.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

This can improve the identification of explanatory factors compared to tree-agnostic diversity measures. However, applying tree-based diversity measures to metagenome data is more challenging than for single-locus sequencing (e.g., 16S rRNA gene). The Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) provides a genome-based reference database that can be used for species-level metagenome profiling, and a multi-locus phylogeny of all genomes that can be employed for diversity calculations. This approach also allows for functional diversity measures based on genomic content or traits inferred from it. Still, it is unclear how metagenome-based assessments of microbiome diversity benefit from incorporating phylogeny or function into measures of diversity. We assessed this by measuring phylogeny-based, function-based, and tree-agnostic diversity measures from a large, global collection of human gut metagenomes composed of 33 studies and 3348 samples. We found tree-based measures to explain phenotypic variation (e.g., westernization, disease status, and gender) better or on par with tree-agnostic measures. Ecophylogenetic and functional diversity measures provided unique insight into how microbiome diversity was partitioned by phenotype. Tree-based measures greatly improved machine learning model performance for predicting westernization, disease status, and gender, relative to models trained solely on tree-agnostic measures.

The response generally requires the synthesis of novel proteins, but this synthesis can be impeded due to the depletion of biosynthetic precursors when growth conditions vary. Microbes must thus devise effective response strategies to manage depleting precursors. To better understand these strategies, we here investigate the active response of Escherichia coli to changes in nutrient conditions, connecting transient gene-expression behavior to growth phenotypes. By synthetically modifying the gene expression during changing growth conditions, we show how the competition by genes for the limited protein synthesis capacity constrains the cellular response. Despite this constraint, cells substantially express genes that are not required, severely slowing down the response. These findings highlight that cells do not optimize growth and recovery in every encountered environment but rather exhibit hardwired response strategies that may have evolved to promote growth in their native environment and include the regulation of multiple genes. The constraint and the suboptimality of the cellular response uncovered in this study provides a conceptual framework relevant for many research applications, from the prediction of evolution and adaptation to the improvement of gene circuits in biotechnology.</jats:p>",2021-04-28

Identifying host-specific genetic factors indicate biological mechanisms of therapeutic relevance and clarify causal relationships of modifiable environmental risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes. We formed a global network of researchers to investigate the role of human genetics in SARS-COV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. We describe the results of three genome-wide association meta-analyses comprising 49,562 COVID-19 patients from 46 studies across 19 countries worldwide. We reported 15 genome-wide significant loci that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe manifestations of COVID-19. Several of these loci correspond to previously documented associations to lung or autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. They also represent potentially actionable mechanisms in response to infection. We further identified smoking and body mass index as causal risk factors for severe COVID-19. The identification of novel host genetic factors associated with COVID-19, with unprecedented speed, was enabled by prioritization of shared resources and analytical frameworks.

However, this is biased to activity in the fastest conducting axons. It is unclear whether conclusions obtained in this context are representative of volitional activity in mild-to-moderate contractions. A possible alternative to overcome this limitation is to study the corticospinal transmission of endogenously generated brain activity. Here we study the transmission speeds of cortical beta rhythms travelling to the muscles during steady contractions. To do this, we introduce new methods to improve delay estimates in the corticomuscular transmission of beta rhythms, and which we validate both in simulations and experimentally. Applying these approaches to experimental data from humans, we show that corticomuscular beta transmission delays are only 1-2ms longer than expected from the fastest corticospinal pathway. Simulations using realistic distributions of the conduction velocities for descending axons projecting to lower motoneurons suggest two scenarios that can explain these results: either a very small fraction of only the fastest corticospinal axons selectively transmit beta activity, or else the entire pool does. The implications that these two scenarios have for our understanding of corticomuscular interactions are discussed in the final part of this manuscript.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>SIGNIFICANCE</jats:title><jats:p>We present and validate an improved methodology to measure the delay in the transmission of cortical beta activity to tonically active muscles.

Moreover, currently available vaccines and therapeutic antibodies were shown to be less effective against new variants, in particular, the South African (SA) variant, termed 501Y.V2 or B.1.351. To assess the efficacy of the CT-P59 monoclonal antibody against the SA variant, we sought to perform as in vitro binding and neutralization assays, and in vivo animal studies. CT-P59 neutralized B.1.1.7 variant to a similar extent as to wild type virus. CT-P59 showed reduced binding affinity against a RBD (receptor binding domain) triple mutant containing mutations defining B.1.351 (K417N/E484K/N501Y) also showed reduced potency against the SA variant in live virus and pseudovirus neutralization assay systems. However, in vivo ferret challenge studies demonstrated that a therapeutic dosage of CT-P59 was able to decrease B.1.351 viral load in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, comparable to that observed for the wild type virus. Overall, although CT-P59 showed reduced in vitro neutralizing activity against the SA variant, sufficient antiviral effect in B.1.351-infected animals was confirmed with a clinical dosage of CT-P59, suggesting that CT-P59 has therapeutic potential for COVID-19 patients infected with SA variant.</jats:p>",2021-04-28

Current algorithms for enrichment computation such as Fisher‚Äôs exact test and hypergeometric test totally depend on the category count numbers of the gene list and one gene set. In this case, whatever the genes are, they were treated equally. However, actually genes show different scores in their essentiality in a gene list and in a gene set. It is thus hypothesized that the essentiality scores could be important and should be considered in gene functional analysis. For this purpose, here we proposed WEAT (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" ext-link-type=""uri"" xlink:href=""https://www.cuilab.cn/weat/"">https://www.cuilab.cn/weat/</jats:ext-link>), a weighted gene set enrichment algorithm and online tool by weighting genes using essentiality scores. We confirmed the usefulness of WEAT using two case studies, the functional analysis of one aging-related gene list and one gene list involved in Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC).

While seizures are infrequent and unpredictable, IEDs are far more common, often occurring several times per minute. Yet despite the abundance of IEDs, it remains unknown how they relate to seizures. To better understand this relationship, we examined multi-day recordings of 96-channel microelectrode arrays implanted in human epilepsy patients. These recordings (spanning single cell action potentials to population field potentials) allowed us to study the microscale spatiotemporal organization of over 45,000 IEDs across 10 participants from 2 surgical centers. These recordings showed that the majority of IEDs propagate across neocortex as traveling waves. While all of these traveling wave distributions exhibited a predominant, consistent direction, the majority also exhibited a second, auxiliary, direction. Clustering the IED distributions revealed that their predominant and auxiliary distributions were antipodal, mimicking the spatial microstructure of seizure discharges (SDs) that we have previously reported. We thus compared spatial features of IED sub-distributions to those for SDs, showing a correspondence between ictal and interictal spatial properties in participants whose microelectrode arrays were recruited into the seizure from adjacent cortical tissue. These results reveal fundamental relationships between IEDs and seizures and suggest how IEDs could be used to infer spatial features of seizures.</jats:p>",2021-04-29

In this investigation, we analyzed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health data from Parana, the largest state in southern half of Brazil, between September 1, 2020 and March 17, 2021, to evaluate recent trends in case fatality rates in different age groups. A total of 553,518 cases of SARS-CoV-2, 8,853 currently registered as fatal, were finally included in our analysis. All age groups showed either decline or stabilization of the case fatality rates (CFRs) between September 2020 and January 2021. In February 2021, an increase in CFR for almost all age groups could be instead observed. All groups above 20 years of age showed statistically significant increases in CFR when diagnosed in February 2021 as opposed to January 2021. Patients aged 20-29 years experienced a tripling of their CFR, from 0.04% to 0.13%, while those aged 30-39, 40-49, 50-59 experienced approximate CFR doubling. Individuals between 20 and 29 years of age whose diagnosis was made in February 2021 had an over 3-fold higher risk of death compared to those diagnosed in January 2021 (Risk Ratio (RR): 3.15 [95%CI: 1.52-6.53], p&lt;0.01), while those aged 30-39, 40-49, 50-59 years experienced 93% (1.93 [95%CI:1.31-2.85], p&lt;0.01), 110% (RR: 2.10 [95%CI:1.62-2.72], p&lt;0.01), and 80% (RR: 1.80 [95%CI:1.50-2.16], p&lt;0.01) increases in risk of death, respectively. Notably, the observed CFR increase coincided with the second consecutive month of declining number of diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 cases. Taken together, these preliminary findings suggest significant increases in CFR in young and middle-aged adults after identification of a novel SARS-CoV-2 strain circulating in Brazil, and this should raise public health alarms, including the need for more aggressive local and regional public health interventions and faster vaccination.</jats:p>",2021-03-26

Hierarchical Bayesian (HB) calibration provides a third option that frees modelers from assuming model parameters to be completely generic or completely site-specific and allows a formal distinction between prediction at known calibration sites and out-of-sample prediction to new sites. Here, we compare calibrations of a process-based dynamic vegetation model to eddy-covariance data across 12 temperate deciduous Ameriflux sites fit using either site-specific, joint cross-site, or HB approaches. To be able to apply HB to computationally demanding process-based models we introduce a novel emulator-based HB calibration tool, which we make available through the PEcAn community cyberinfrastructure. Using these calibrations to make predictions at held-out tower sites, we show that the joint cross-site calibration is falsely over-confident due to more information fed into the calibration. By showing which parameters show high site-to-site variability, HB calibration also formally gives us a structure that can detect which process representations are missing from the models and prioritize errors based on the magnitude of the associated uncertainty. For example, in our case-study we were able to identify large site-to-site variability in the parameters associated with the temperature responses of respiration and photosynthesis, associated with a lack of thermal acclimation and adaptation in the model. Moving forward, HB approaches present important new opportunities for statistical modeling of the spatiotemporal variability in modeled parameters and processes that yields both new insights and improved predictions.</jats:p>",2021-04-29

The system allowed us to measure key biological features such as oxygen distribution, cell proliferation and migration. Using this data, we developed a computational model to investigate the motility and phenotypic persistence of hypoxic and post-hypoxic cells during tumor progression. The behavior of hypoxic and post-hypoxic cells was defined by phenotypic persistence time, cell movement bias and the fraction of cells that respond to an enhanced migratory stimulus. Our studies revealed that post-hypoxic cells have an enhanced persistent migratory phenotype that promotes the formation of invasive structures (‚Äúplumes‚Äù) expanding towards the oxygenated tumor regions. This work combined advanced cell tracking and imaging techniques with mathematical modeling, and revealed for the first time that a persistent invasive migratory phenotype that develops under hypoxic conditions enhances their escape into non-hypoxic tumor regions to invade the surrounding tissue.</jats:p>",2021-01-01

However, it remains unclear if and how the facilitatory effects of acute stress on hippocampal information coding are disrupted as the stress becomes chronic. To examine this, we compared the impact of acute and chronic stress on neural activity in the CA1 subregion of male mice subjected to a chronic immobilization stress paradigm. We observed that following first exposure to stress (acute stress), the spatial information encoded in the hippocampus sharpened and the neurons became increasingly tuned to the underlying theta oscillation in the local field potential (LFP). However, following repeated exposure to same stress (chronic stress), spatial tuning was poorer and the power of both the slow-gamma (30-50 Hz) and fast-gamma (55-90 Hz) oscillations, which correlate with excitatory inputs into the region, decreased. These results support the idea that acute and chronic stress differentially affect neural computations carried out by hippocampal circuits and suggest that acute stress may improve cognitive processing.</jats:p>",2021-04-23

One model was applied to European countries and published in <jats:italic>Nature</jats:italic><jats:sup>1</jats:sup> (model 1), concluding that complete lockdown was by far the most effective measure, responsible for 80% of the reduction in <jats:italic>R<jats:sub>t</jats:sub></jats:italic>, and 3 million deaths were avoided in the examined countries. The Imperial College team applied a different model to the USA states<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> (model 2), and in response to our original submission, the Imperial team has proposed in a referee report a third model which is a hybrid of the first two models (model 3). We demonstrate that inference is highly nonrobust to model specification. In particular, inference regarding the relative effectiveness of NPIs changes substantially with the model and decision makers who are unaware of, or ignore, model uncertainty are underestimating the risk attached to any decisions based on that model. Our primary observation is that by applying to European countries the model that the Imperial College team used for the USA states (model 2), complete lockdown has no or little effect, since it was introduced typically at a point when <jats:italic>R<jats:sub>t</jats:sub></jats:italic> was already very low.

The wide influence of dysfunctional HMTs complexes and the typically upregulated MYC levels in diverse tumor types suggested WDR5 as an attractive drug target. Indeed, protein-protein interface inhibitors for two protein interaction interfaces on WDR5 have been developed. While such compounds only inhibit a subset of WDR5 interactions, chemically induced proteasomal degradation of WDR5 might represent an elegant way to target all oncogenic function.

Often this information must be inferred based on the presence of predictive environmental events. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) are two key nodes in the circuitry supporting such outcome guided behavior, but very little is known about the function of direct connections between these regions. Here, in male rats, we first anatomically confirmed the existence of bidirectional, direct projections between the mOFC and BLA and found that BLA projections to mOFC are distinct from those to lateral OFC (lOFC). Next, using pathway-specific chemogenetic inhibition and the outcome-selective Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer and devaluation tests, we interrogated the function of the bidirectional mOFC‚ÜíBLA connections in reward-directed behavior. We found evidence that the mOFC‚ÜíBLA pathway mediates the use of environmental cues to predict which reward is available, information needed to infer which action to choose, and how desirable that reward is to ensure adaptive cue responses. By contrast, the BLA‚ÜímOFC pathway is not needed to use cues to know which reward is available but is needed to use the current desirability of that reward to infer how advantageous it would be to respond to the cue. These functions differ from those we previously identified for the lOFC-BLA circuit. Collectively, these data reveal the mOFC-BLA circuit as critical for the cue-dependent reward outcome expectations that influence adaptive behavior and decision making.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</jats:title><jats:p>To make good decisions we evaluate how advantageous a particular course of action would be.

The data indicates that, while the camshaft can rotate inside the stator by diffusion, mechanical deformation of the stator makes the camshaft pause at a set of preferred orientations. By changing the mechanical stiffness of the stator, we could accelerate or suppress the Brownian rotation within the mechanism, thereby demonstrating an allosteric coupling between the movement of the camshaft and of the stator, and the ability to tailor the free energy landscape that governs the rotary motion.

The molecular mechanism underlying TBK1 activation by STING remains poorly understood. Here we report a cell system by which STING and TBK1 are simultaneously monitored. The system utilizes STING/TBK1-double knockout (KO) cells, fluorescent protein-tagged TBK1 and STING, and super-resolution microscopy. After STING stimulation, TBK1 is directly recruited to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), not to the other parts of the Golgi. The recruitment of TBK1 does not require its kinase activity. C-terminal STING variants (ŒîC9 and L373A), in which the TBK1-STING binding interface is mutated or deleted, induce the recruitment of TBK1. These results indicate that the kinase activity of TBK1 or the C-terminal motif of STING is not required for its recruitment to TGN, but rather for the formation of the stable STING signalling complex at TGN.</jats:p>",2021-04-27

However, there has been no central, frequently-updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or quarterly all-cause mortality data from 89 countries and territories, openly available as the regularly-updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to compute the excess mortality in each country during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that in the worst-affected countries the annual mortality increased by over 50%, while in several other countries it decreased by over 5%, presumably due to lockdown measures decreasing the non-COVID mortality. Moreover, we found that while some countries have been reporting the COVID-19 deaths very accurately, many countries have been underreporting their COVID-19 deaths by an order of magnitude or more.

They emerge from different, well-described, cytoskeletal precursor structures that elongate to branches. While branches are thought to be maintained by shared cytoskeletal regulators, our data from mouse hippocampal neurons indicate that the precursor structures trigger alternative branch maintenance mechanisms with differing stabilities. While branches originating from lamellipodia or growth cone splitting events collapse soon after formation, branches emerging from filopodia persist. Furthermore, compared to other developing neurites, axons stabilise all branches and preferentially initiate branches from filopodia. These differences explain the decreased stability of branches we observe in neurons lacking the plasma membrane protein phospholipid phosphatase related protein 3 (PLPPR3/PRG2). Rather than altering branch stability directly, PLPPR3 boosts a ‚Äòfilopodia branch program‚Äô on axons, thereby indirectly initiating more long-lived branches. We propose that studies on branching should distinguish overall stabilising effects from effects on precursor types, ideally using multifactorial statistical models as exemplified in this study.</jats:p>",2021-04-23

To obtain a global and unbiased view of the relative importance of different sequence determinants in gene expression, we measured transcriptional activity of DNA sequences that are in aggregate ‚àº100 times longer than the human genome in three different cell types. We show that enhancers can be classified to three main types: classical enhancers<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>, closed chromatin enhancers and chromatin-dependent enhancers, which act via different mechanisms and differ in motif content. Transcription factors (TFs) act generally in an additive manner with weak grammar, with classical enhancers increasing expression from promoters by a mechanism that does not involve specific TF-TF interactions. Few TFs are strongly active in a cell, with most activities similar between cell types. Chromatin-dependent enhancers are enriched in forkhead motifs, whereas classical enhancers contain motifs for TFs with strong transactivator domains such as ETS and bZIP; these motifs are also found at transcription start site (TSS)-proximal positions. However, some TFs, such as NRF1 only activate transcription when placed close to the TSS, and others such as YY1 display positional preference with respect to the TSS. TFs can thus be classified into four non-exclusive subtypes based on their transcriptional activity: chromatin opening, enhancing, promoting and TSS determining factors ‚Äì consistent with the view that the binding motif is the only atomic unit of gene expression.</jats:p>",2021-03-18

A total of 8,729 finger stick blood specimens were probed and analyzed for IgG and IgM antibodies using a coronavirus antigen microarray (COVAM).The microarray contained 10 SARS-CoV-2 antigens including nucleocapid protein (NP) and several varying fragments of the spike protein, as well as 4 SARS, 3 MERS, 12 Common CoV, and 8 Influenza antigens.Based on a random forest based prediction algorithm, between May and December, prior to vaccine rollout, we observed that seropositivity in the HCW cohort increased from 4.5% to 13%. An intensive vaccination campaign with mRNA vaccines was initiated on December 16, 2020 and 6,724 healthcare workers were vaccinated within 3 weeks. The observed seropositivity of the HCW specimens taken in the last week of January 2021 jumped to 78%, and by the last week in February it reached 93%, and peaked at 98% seropositive in March. The antibody profile induced by natural exposure differed from the profile induced after mRNA vaccination. Messenger RNA vaccines induced elevated antibody (Ab) reactivity levels against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike, and cross-reactive responses against SARS and MERS RBD domains. Nucleocapsid protein (NP), which is an immunodominant antigen induced after natural exposure, is not present in the vaccine and can be used as a biomarker of past exposure. The results show that naturally-exposed individuals mount a stronger anti-spike response upon vaccination than individuals that were not previously exposed. Longitudinal specimens taken at approximately weekly intervals from 9 individuals show variation in the response to the mRNA vaccine, with some showing a vigorous response to the first dose (prime) and others requiring a subsequent dose (boost) to reach high anti-SARS-CoV-2 levels. Antibody titers determined by serial dilution of the specimens were used to accurately compare antibody levels in these samples. mRNA vaccinees after the boost have higher Ab titers (up to 10 times higher) than convalescent plasmas from donors who recovered from natural infection. The results of this study exemplify the time course and outcomes expected from similar mRNA mass vaccination campaigns conducted in other institutions.</jats:p>",2021-04-19

We retrieved results from routine monthly PCR testing, as well as outbreak and clinical testing for SARS-CoV-2, thereby capturing data on asymptomatic as well as symptomatic infections, which we linked to vaccination records. We estimated vaccine effectiveness to be 56% (19-76%) at 28-34 days, and 62% (23-81%) at 35-48 days following a single dose of ChAdOx1 or BNT162. Our findings suggest that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is substantially reduced from 28 days following the first dose of either vaccine and that this effect is maintained for at least 7 weeks, with similar protection offered by both vaccine types. We also found that PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values, which are negatively associated with the ability to isolate virus, were significantly higher in infections occurring at ‚â• 28days post vaccination compared to those occurring in the unvaccinated period, suggesting that vaccination may reduce onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in breakthrough infections. To the best of our knowledge, our findings constitute the first real-world evidence on vaccine effectiveness against infection for ChAdOx1, in any age group. We can also infer that both vaccines are effective against the B.1.1.7 variant, because our analysis period coincided with the rapid emergence of B.1.1.7 in England during the second wave of the pandemic.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Implications of all the available evidence</jats:title><jats:p>Our findings add to the growing body of evidence on the protective effect of the BNT162b vaccines in residents of LTCFs and demonstrate the effectiveness of ChAdOx1 in this vulnerable population. Evaluating single-dose vaccine efficacy has become increasingly important in light of extended dosing intervals that have been implemented in order to maximise vaccine coverage across high-risk groups. Further work is required to evaluate the effectiveness of the first vaccine dose after 8-12 weeks, as well as following the second dose, and to evaluate the long-term impact of vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 infection, transmission and mortality in LTCFs. This will inform policy decisions regarding the ongoing need for disease control measures in LTCF such as visitor restrictions, which continue to have a detrimental impact on the wellbeing of residents, their relatives, and staff.</jats:p><jats:p>Supplementary material attached.</jats:p></jats:sec></jats:sec>",2021-03-26

As the majority of human genes have an identifiable paralog, exploiting synthetic lethality between paralogs may be a broadly applicable approach for targeting gene loss in cancer. However only a biased subset of human paralog pairs has been tested for synthetic lethality to date. Here, by analysing genome-wide CRISPR screens and molecular profiles of over 700 cancer cell lines, we identify features predictive of synthetic lethality between paralogs, including shared protein-protein interactions and evolutionary conservation. We develop a machine-learning classifier based on these features to predict which paralog pairs are most likely to be synthetic lethal and to explain why. We show that our classifier accurately predicts the results of combinatorial CRISPR screens in cancer cell lines and furthermore can distinguish pairs that are synthetic lethal in multiple cell lines from those that are cell-line specific.</jats:p>",2020-12-16

Evidence of drug resistance to explain this difference was not found. Reduced levels of subgenomic (sg) RNA during treatment of the second patient, suggest an additional effect of remdesivir on viral replication that is independent of viral RNA levels.

We conclude that these are likely to have arisen from within-host evolution, and not co-transmission, although superinfection cannot be excluded in one case.

Here, we studied intra- and interspecific GS variation in taxonomically complex British eyebrights (Euphrasia).

We generated GS data for 192 individuals of diploid and tetraploid Euphrasia and analysed GS variation in relation to ploidy, taxonomy, population affiliation, and geography. We further compared the genomic repeat content of 30 samples.

We found considerable genuine intraspecific GS variation, and observed isolation-by-distance for GS in outcrossing diploids. Tetraploid Euphrasia showed contrasting patterns, with GS increasing with latitude in outcrossing Euphrasia arctica, but little GS variation in the highly selfing Euphrasia micrantha. Interspecific differences in GS genomic repeat percentages were small. 

We show the utility of treating GS as the outcome of polygenic variation. Like other types of genetic variation, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, GS variation may be increased through hybridisation and population subdivision. In addition to selection on associated traits, GS is predicted to be affected indirectly by selection due to pleiotropy of the underlying PAVs.</jats:p>",2021-04-28

Plasma lipid profile was measured in 861 COVID-19 patients classified as mild (n=215), moderate (n=364), severe (n=217) or critical (n=65) and 1108 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. We showed that the levels of both TG and HDL-C were significantly lower in patients with severe disease than in patients with moderate or mild disease. After successful treatment, cholesterol metabolism was reestablished in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The serum concentrations of TC and HDL-C can be used as indicators of disease severity and prognosis in COVID-19 patients.</jats:p>",2020-04-22
