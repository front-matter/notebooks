However, the separation of single-molecule fluorescence events in thousands of frames dramatically increases the image acquisition time and phototoxicity, impeding the observation of instantaneous intracellular dynamics. Based on deep learning networks, we develop a single-frame super-resolution microscopy (SFSRM) approach that reconstructs a super-resolution image from a single frame of a diffraction-limited image to support live-cell super-resolution imaging at a ~20 nm spatial resolution and a temporal resolution of up to 10 ms over thousands of time points. We demonstrate that our SFSRM method enables the visualization of the dynamics of vesicle transport at a millisecond temporal resolution in the dense and vibrant microtubule network in live cells. Moreover, the well-trained network model can be used with different live-cell imaging systems, such as confocal and light-sheet microscopes, making super-resolution microscopy accessible to nonexperts.</p>', 'posted': '2021-10-09'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.10.06.21264535', 'tweets': 37, 'archive': 'medRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)', 'covid': True, 'title': 'Analytical performance of eleven SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid tests for Delta variant', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Meriem Bekliz'}, {'name': 'Kenneth Adea'}, {'name': 'Manel Essaidi-Laziosi'}, {'name': 'Camille Escadafal'}, {'name': 'Jilian A Sacks'}, {'name': 'Laurent Kaiser'}, {'name': 'Isabella Eckerle'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>Global concerns arose as the emerged and rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant.

We previously used subjects' times of death (TOD) as a marker of time of day to investigate transcriptional rhythm alterations in psychiatric disorders. Using TOD and RNA sequencing, we discovered rhythmic transcripts in both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), key brain areas involved in opioid addiction, were largely distinct between OUD and unaffected comparison subjects. Further, fewer rhythmic transcripts were identified in DLPFC of OUD subjects compared to unaffected subjects, but nearly double the number of rhythmic transcripts were found in the NAc of OUD subjects. In OUD, rhythmic transcripts in the NAc peaked either in the evening or near sunrise, and were associated with dopamine, opioid, and GABAergic neurotransmission. Co-expression network analysis identified several OUD-specific modules in the NAc, enriched for transcripts involved in the modulation of dopamine and GABA synapses, including glutamatergic signaling and extracellular matrices. Integrative analyses with human GWAS revealed that rhythmic transcripts in DLPFC and NAc were enriched for genomic loci associated with sleep duration and insomnia.

We used RNA-seq to compare gene expression in the right and left retinas and telencephalon. As expected, no differential expression between left and right was present in darkness. We detected differential gene expression in right vs left retina after 6 hours of light exposure.

We conclude that host factors, pathogen opportunity or alternate virulence loci not linked to invasive disease elsewhere are likely to be the major determinants of invasive disease in Malawi. Distinct ST and O-type distributions in Malawi highlights the need for geographically aware sampling to robustly define secular trends in Klebsiella diversity. Colonising and invasive isolates in Blantyre are similar and hence O-typing of colonising Klebsiella isolates may be a rapid and cost-effective approach to describe global diversity and guide vaccine development.</p>', 'posted': '2021-10-07'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.10.08.463705', 'tweets': 6, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Evolutionary Biology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Inferring the mode and strength of ongoing selection', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Gustavo Valadares Barroso'}, {'name': 'Kirk Lohmueller'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>Genome sequence data is no longer scarce.

When obstacle fields were short, bees flew at altitudes near the midpoint between the tunnel floor and ceiling. When obstacle fields approached or exceeded this midpoint, bees typically, but not always, increased their altitudes to fly over the obstacles. Bees that flew above the obstacle fields exhibited 40% faster ground speeds and 36% larger lateral excursions than bees that flew within the obstacle fields, likely due to the visual feedback from obstacles and narrow space available within the obstacle field.

In order to address this long-standing challenge, we introduce a novel method (called HARMOnic miNImization - Harmoni) that removes the signal components which can be harmonics of a non-sinusoidal signal.

For this, approaches based on the principle of sequence similarity, conservation of motifs and domains, phylogenetic analysis, and modulation of gene expression in response to <italic>Hemileia vastatrix</italic> were used. The candidate sequences for PRRs in <italic>C. arabica</italic> (<italic>Ca1-LYP, Ca2-LYP, Ca1-CERK1, Ca2-CERK1, Ca-LYK4, Ca1-LYK5</italic> and <italic>Ca2-LYK5</italic>) showed high similarity with the reference PRRs used: <italic>Os-CEBiP, At-CERK1, At-LYK4</italic> and <italic>At-LYK5</italic>. Moreover, the ectodomains of these sequences showed high identity or similarity with the reference sequences, indicating structural and functional conservation. The studied sequences are also phylogenetically related to the reference PRRs described in Arabidopsis, rice, and other plant species. All candidates for receptors had their expression induced after the inoculation with <italic>H. vastatrix</italic>, since the first time of sampling at 6 hours post-inoculation (hpi). At 24 hpi, there was a significant increase in expression, for most of the receptors evaluated, and at 48 hpi, a suppression. The results showed that the candidate sequences for PRRs in the <italic>C. arabica</italic> genome display high homology with fungal PRRs already described in the literature. Besides, they respond to pathogen inoculation and seem to be involved in the perception or signaling of fungal chitin, acting as receptors or coreceptors of this molecule. These findings represent an advance in the understanding of the basal immunity of this species.</p>', 'posted': '2021-10-07'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.10.07.463549', 'tweets': 3, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Microbiology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Evolutionary sweeps of subviral parasites and their phage host bring unique parasite variants and disappearance of a phage CRISPR-Cas system', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Angus Angermeyer'}, {'name': 'Stephanie G.

Whether these fluctuations are instrumental or epiphenomenal to the behavior remains elusive. Attempts to experimentally manipulate neural oscillations exogenously using non-invasive brain stimulation have shown some promise, but difficulty with tailoring stimulation parameters to individuals has hindered progress in this field. We demonstrate here using electroencephalography (EEG) neurofeedback in a brain-computer interface that human participants (n=44) learned over multiple sessions across a 6-day period to self-regulate their Beta rhythm (13-20 Hz) over the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC). This Beta modulation had observable consequences on cognitive behavior: changes in an individual's inhibitory control performance before and after training were predicted by the magnitude of their training-related change in Beta over rIFC. This was not the case for a control group (n=38) who underwent training of their Alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz). The present data support the view that the right frontal Beta rhythm is a key component of the brain's inhibitory control system. Most importantly, we introduce causality to this relationship for the first time, as experimental modulation of rIFC Beta activity had a measurable impact upon behavior.</p>\", 'posted': '2021-10-09'}]\n"
