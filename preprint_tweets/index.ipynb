Cardiac damage is attributed mostly to a bystander effect: the aberrant host response to acute respiratory infection. However, direct infection of cardiac tissue by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also occurs. We examined here the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) that beat spontaneously. These cardiomyocytes express the angiotensin I converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and a subset of the proteases that mediate spike protein cleavage in the lungs, but not transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection was productive: viral transcripts accounted for about 88% of total mRNA. In the cytoplasm of infected hiPSC-CM, smooth walled exocytic vesicles contained numerous 65-90 nm particles with typical ribonucleocapsid structures, and virus-like particles with knob-like spikes covered the cell surface. To better understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 spread in hiPSC-CM we engineered an expression vector coding for the spike protein with a monomeric emerald-green fluorescent protein fused to its cytoplasmic tail (S-mEm). Proteolytic processing of S-mEm and the parental spike were equivalent. Live cell imaging tracked spread of S-mEm signal from cell to cell and documented formation of syncytia. A cell-permeable, peptide-based molecule that blocks the catalytic site of furin abolished cell fusion. A spike mutant with the single amino acid change R682S that inactivates the furin cleavage site was fusion inactive. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in hiPSC-CM and furin activation of its spike protein is required for fusion-based cytopathology. This hiPSC-CM platform provides an opportunity for target-based drug discovery in cardiac COVID-19.</p>', 'posted': '2021-07-30'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.07.23.453379', 'tweets': 65, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Bioinformatics', 'covid': False, 'title': 'AlphaPept, a modern and open framework for MS-based proteomics', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Maximilian T.

There is a plethora of different computational tools that process the raw MS data and derive peptide and protein identification and quantification. During the last decade, there has been dramatic progress in computer science and software engineering, including collaboration tools that have transformed research and industry. To leverage these advances, we developed AlphaPept, a Python-based open-source framework for efficient processing of large high-resolution MS data sets. Using Numba for just-in-time machine code compilation on CPU and GPU, we achieve hundred-fold speed improvements while maintaining clear syntax and rapid development speed. AlphaPept uses the Python scientific stack of highly optimized packages, reducing the code base to domain-specific tasks while providing access to the latest advances in machine learning. We provide an easy on-ramp for community validation and contributions through the concept of literate programming, implemented in Jupyter Notebooks of the different modules. A framework for continuous integration, testing, and benchmarking enforces solid software engineering principles. Large datasets can rapidly be processed as shown by the analysis of hundreds of cellular proteomes in minutes per file, many-fold faster than the data acquisiton. The AlphaPept framework can be used to build automated processing pipelines using efficient HDF5 based file formats, web-serving functionality and compatibility with downstream analysis tools. Easy access for end-users is provided by one-click installation of the graphical user interface, for advanced users via a modular Python library, and for developers via a fully open GitHub repository.</p>', 'posted': '2021-07-26'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.07.23.21261041', 'tweets': 58, 'archive': 'medRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Public and Global Health', 'covid': True, 'title': 'The impact of large mobile air purifiers on aerosol concentration in classrooms and the reduction of airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'F.

Here, the aerosol concentration is reduced by natural ventilation. In this context, we are investigating the effect of large mobile air purifiers (AP) with HEPA filters on particle concentration and their suitability for classroom use in a primary school in Germany. The three tested APs differ significantly in their air outlet characteristics. Measurements of the number of particles, the particle size distribution, and the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration were carried out in the classroom with students (April/May 2021) and with an aerosol generator without students. In this regard, the use of APs leads to a substantial reduction in aerosol particles. At the same time, the three APs are found to have differences in their particle decay rate, noise level, and flow velocity. In addition to the measurements, the effect of various influencing parameters on the potential inhaled particle dose was investigated using a calculation model. The parameters considered include the duration of stay, particle concentration in exhaled air, respiratory flow rate, virus lifetime, ventilation interval, ventilation efficiency, AP volumetric flow, as well as room size. Based on the resulting effect diagrams, significant recommendations can be derived for reducing the risk of infection from virus-laden aerosols. Finally, the measurements were compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, as such tools can aid the optimal placement and configuration of APs and can be used to study the effect of the spread of aerosols from a source in the classroom.</p>', 'posted': '2021-07-26'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.07.23.453492', 'tweets': 57, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Scientific Communication and Education', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Delineating Medical Education: Bibliometric Research Approach(es)', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Lauren A.

Restoring the amount of chromatin-bound cohesins to control levels, or preventing the accumulation of cohesins at CTCF sites, in cells experiencing oncogenic c-Myc activity prevents replication stress.

Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) can be used to detect associations between the genetically predicted expression of a gene and disease risk, thus implicating candidate disease genes. However, causal disease genes at TWAS-associated loci generally remain unknown due to gene co-regulation, which leads to correlations across genes in predicted expression. We developed a new method, gene co-regulation score (GCSC) regression, to identify gene sets that are enriched for disease heritability explained by the predicted expression of causal disease genes in the gene set. GCSC regresses TWAS chi-square statistics on gene co-regulation scores reflecting correlations in predicted gene expression; GCSC determines that a gene set is enriched for disease heritability if genes with high co-regulation to the gene set have higher TWAS chi-square statistics than genes with low co-regulation to the gene set, beyond what is expected based on co-regulation to all genes. We verified via simulations that GCSC is well-calibrated, and well-powered to identify gene sets that are enriched for disease heritability explained by predicted expression.

Efforts to assess “zoonotic risk” often use trait-based analyses to identify which viral and reservoir host groups are most likely to source zoonoses but have not fully addressed how and why the impacts of zoonotic viruses vary in terms of disease severity (‘virulence’), capacity to spread within human populations (‘transmissibility’), or total human mortality (‘death burden’). We analyzed trends in human case fatality rates, transmission capacities, and total death burdens across a comprehensive dataset of mammalian and avian zoonotic viruses. Bats harbor the most virulent zoonotic viruses even when compared to birds, which alongside bats, have been hypothesized to be “special” zoonotic reservoirs due to molecular adaptations that support the physiology of flight. Reservoir host groups more closely related to humans—in particular, Primates—harbor less virulent, but more highly transmissible viruses. Importantly, disproportionately high human death burden, arguably the most important metric of zoonotic risk, is not associated with any animal reservoir, including bats. Our data demonstrate that mechanisms driving death burdens are diverse and often contradict trait-based predictions. Ultimately, total human mortality is dependent on context-specific epidemiological dynamics, which are shaped by a combination of viral traits and conditions in the animal host population and across and beyond the human-animal interface.

For this, viral discovery targeting specific reservoirs may be inefficient as death burden correlates with viral, not reservoir, traits, and depends on context-specific epidemiological dynamics across and beyond the human-animal interface.

Despite important advancements in tracking techniques, the specifics of mortality events in anadromous salmonids during their initial migration to sea remains somewhat elusive. Here, we develop a framework combining spatial and temporal detections of smolt riverine migration from two tracking techniques, which enable inferences to be made about mortality locations, causes, and rates. We embed this framework into a fine-scale behaviour study of migration and social structure. In this study, we demonstrate that during their initial riverine transitional phase, smolts were particularly vulnerable to predators. Specifically, avian predation appeared to be the main cause of mortality (42%), although piscine predation events were not trivial (14%). Our results suggested some direct and indirect tagging-induced mortality (e.g., through increased predation vulnerability), which highlights the importance of determining tagging mortality in a telemetry study to ensure adequate interpretation of migration success. There is evidence that predation induced selection on smolt morphology. Unsuccessful river salmon migrants with a phenotype comprising a shorter head and jaw and smaller eye had a higher probability of mortality in the later parts of riverine migration where avian and aquatic predation mortality dominated. In contrast, mortality earlier in river migration was independent of phenotype, most likely a result of tagging effects. Successfully river migrants were found to be interacting with each other, often in a pair or as a trio, indicating that a few individuals of Atlantic salmon and sea trout formed notable intra- and interspecific social associations. However, the heterogeneity of the social associations of successful migrants did not support the assumption that social network features attributed any clear specific benefits of reduced predation risk.

Behaviorally, both age groups benefited from target pairs presented in a visual format that was congruent with how the pair was learned. While no age difference was observed in hits, the typical age-related increase in false alarms was found. Congruent with behavioral results, neither the relationship between target-related patterns of neural activity across memory phases (as measured by ERS) nor the discriminability of target classification as a function of condition at retrieval (as measured by MVPA). However, with regard to false memories, older adults exhibited overall lower pattern similarity for hits and FAs compared to hits and CRs (as measured by RSA). Additionally, Hit-FA RSA correlated with age- related increases in associative FAs across visual, frontal, and parietal cortices.

Pantropical lineages - animals and plants distributed across the three tropical continental regions of Asia, Africa, and America - provide a way to test how different environments and communities influence morphological diversification. Here, we examined a monophyletic group of frugivorous birds, the barbets and toucans (Ramphastoidea), which diversified independently on three continents, to investigate whether clades in each region exhibit similar (phylogenetically constrained) or distinct (ecologically influenced) patterns of morphological diversification. Our results show that despite differences in community dynamics in these regions, lineage accumulation patterns through time on all three continents are broadly similar, putatively due to phylogenetic niche conservatism. We quantified morphological variation in light of phylogenetic relatedness to further reveal that all barbet lineages across continents occupy a conserved region of morphospace after correcting for variation in size. However, in the Neotropics, one lineage, the toucans, have diverged dramatically from typical barbet space and converged toward (yet are distinct from) the trait space occupied by the distantly related hornbills in Asia and Africa. Additionally, we found no link between climatic variables and morphological traits. We conclude that barbets exhibit a conserved morphotype across continents and have diversified by scaling mainly in body size. However, the absence of other large frugivorous birds may have allowed toucans to diversify into a different region of morphospace of increased bill/wing to tail/wing ratios. By examining different continental lineages of a single monophyletic bird group, we shed light on the contrasting effects of regional ecological factors and phylogenetic constraints on morphological diversification.</p>', 'posted': '2021-07-30'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.07.26.453829', 'tweets': 7, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Biochemistry', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Structure and function of the ROR2 cysteine-rich domain in vertebrate noncanonical WNT5A signaling', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Samuel C.

Changes in contrast gain shift the contrast response function laterally, whereas changes in response gain scale the function vertically.

We then conducted two new experiments, comparing suppression from four mask types (monocular and dichoptic overlay masks, and aligned and orthogonal surround masks) on responses to sine wave grating patches flickering at 5Hz. At the occipital pole, there was strong evidence for contrast gain effects in all four mask types at the first harmonic frequency (5Hz). Suppression generally became stronger at more lateral electrode sites, but there was little evidence of response gain effects. At the second harmonic frequency (10Hz) suppression was stronger overall, and involved both contrast and response gain effects.

Herein, using CFTR-depleted zebrafish larvae as an innovative vertebrate model of CF immuno-pathophysiology, combined with murine and human approaches, we sought to determine the effects of Roscovitine on innate immune responses to tissue injury and pathogens in CF condition.

Roscovitine reduces overactive epithelial ROS-mediated neutrophil trafficking, by reducing DUOX2/NADPH-oxidase activity, and accelerates inflammation resolution by inducing neutrophil apoptosis and reverse migration. Importantly, while Roscovitine efficiently enhances intracellular bacterial killing of Mycobacterium abscessus in human CF macrophages ex vivo, we found that treatment with Roscovitine results in worse infection in mouse and zebrafish models. By interfering with DUOX2/NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production, Roscovitine reduces the number of neutrophils at infection sites, and consequently compromises granuloma formation and maintenance, favouring extracellular multiplication of M. abscessus and more severe infection.

As shown for Δ1-854 hTRPA1, a sudden drop in tryptophan fluorescence occurred within 25-20°C indicating a transition between heat and cold conformations of the CTD, and thus it is proposed that the CTD contains a bidirectional temperature switch priming hTRPA1 for either cold or heat.

To this end, two GAL4 lines have to be identified as labelling a neuron of interest.

Mesothelin (Msln) is an attractive immunotherapy target for this cancer, as it is overexpressed by the tumor and contributes to malignant and invasive phenotypes, making antigen loss disadvantageous to the tumor. We previously showed that adoptively transferred T cells engineered to be Msln-specific (TCR1045) preferentially accumulate within established ovarian tumors, delay tumor growth and significantly prolong survival in the ID8VEGF mouse model. However, T cell persistence and anti-tumor activity were not sustained, and we and others have previously detected FasL in the tumor vasculature and the tumor microenvironment (TME) of human and murine ovarian cancers, which can induce apoptosis in infiltrating lymphocytes expressing Fas receptor (Fas). Methods: To concurrently overcome this mechanism for potential immune evasion and enhance T cell responses, we generated an immunomodulatory fusion protein (IFP) containing the Fas extracellular binding domain fused to a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain, rather than the natural death domain. T cells engineered to express TCR1045 alone or in combination with the IFP were transferred into ID8VEGF-tumor bearing mice and evaluated for persistence, proliferation, anti-tumor cytokine production, and therapeutic efficacy. Results: Relative to T cells modified only to express TCR1045, T cells engineered to express both TCR1045 and a Fas IFP preferentially persisted in the TME of tumor-bearing mice due to improved T cell proliferation and survival. Moreover, adoptive immunotherapy with IFP+ T cells significantly prolonged survival in tumor-bearing mice, relative to TCR1045 T cells lacking the IFP. Conclusions: Fas/FasL signaling can mediate T cell death in the ovarian cancer microenvironment, as well as induce activation-induced cell death, an apoptotic mechanism responsible for regulating T cell expansion. Upregulation of FasL by tumor cells and tumor vasculature represents a mechanism for protecting growing tumors from attack by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. As many solid tumors overexpress FasL, an IFP that converts the Fas-mediated death signal into pro-survival and proliferative signals may provide an opportunity to enhance engineered adoptive T cell therapy against many malignancies.</p>', 'posted': '2021-07-31'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.07.28.454269', 'tweets': 4, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Bioinformatics', 'covid': False, 'title': 'SUITOR: selecting the number of mutational signatures through cross-validation', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Donghyuk Lee'}, {'name': 'Difei Wang'}, {'name': 'Xiaohong R.

Some of this can potentially be offset by improved density molecular storage. The potential of using DNA for storing data is immense. DNA can be harnessed as a high density, durable archiving medium for compressing and storing the exponentially growing quantities of digital data that mankind generates. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of DNA-based data storage systems. These include exploration of different encoding and error correction schemes and the use of different technologies for DNA synthesis and sequencing. Recently, the use of composite DNA letters has been demonstrated to leverage the inherent redundancy in DNA based storage systems to achieve higher logical density, offering a more cost-effective approach. However, the suggested composite DNA approach is still limited due to its sensitivity to the stochastic nature of the process. Combinatorial assembly methods were also suggested to encode information on DNA in high density, while avoding the challenges of the stochastic system. These are based on enzynatic assembly processes for producing the synthetic DNA. In this paper, we propose a novel method to encode information into DNA molecules using combinatorial encoding and shortmer DNA synthesis, in compatibility with current chemical DNA synthesis technologies. Our approach is based on a set of easily distinguishable DNA shortmers serving as building blocks and allowing for near-zero error rates. We construct an extended combinatorial alphabet in which every letter is a subset of the set of building blocks. We suggest different combinatorial encoding schemes and explore their theoretical properties and practical implications in terms of error probabilities and required sequencing depth. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we implemented an end-to-end computer simulation of a DNA-based storage system, using our suggested combinatorial encodings. We use simulations to assess the performance of the system and the effect of different parameters. Our simulations suggest that our combinatorial approach can potentially achieve up to 6.5-fold increase in the logical density over standard DNA based storage systems, with near zero reconstruction error. Implementing our approach at scale to perform actual synthesis, requires minimal alterations to current technologies. Our work thus suggests that the combination of combinatorial encoding with standard DNA chemical synthesis technologies can potentially improve current solutions, achieving scalable, efficient and cost- effective DNA-based storage.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-01'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.07.29.454399', 'tweets': 3, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Neuroscience', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Neural-specific alterations in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis and cell signaling associated with two human ganglioside GM3 Synthase Deficiency variants', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Michelle Dookwah'}, {'name': 'Shannon K Wagner'}, {'name': 'Mayumi Ishihara'}, {'name': 'Seok-ho Yu'}, {'name': 'Heidi Ulrichs'}, {'name': 'Michael J Kulik'}, {'name': 'Nadja Zeltner'}, {'name': 'Stephen Dalton'}, {'name': 'Kevin A Strauss'}, {'name': 'Kazuhiro Aoki'}, {'name': 'Richard Steet'}, {'name': 'Michael Tiemeyer'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>GM3 Synthase Deficiency (GM3SD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from pathogenic variants in the ST3GAL5 gene, which encodes GM3 synthase, a glycosphingolipid (GSL)-specific sialyltransferase. This enzyme adds a single alpha3-linked sialic acid to the terminal galactose of lactosylceramide (LacCer) to produce the monosialylated ganglioside GM3. In turn, GM3 is extended by other glycosyltransferases to generate nearly all the complex gangliosides enriched in neural tissue. Pathogenic mechanisms that account for neural phenotypes associated with GM3SD are not known. To explore how loss of GM3 impacts neural-specific glycolipid glycosylation and cell signaling, GM3SD patient fibroblasts bearing one of two different ST3GAL5 variants were reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and then differentiated to neural crest cells (NCCs). GM3 and GM3-derived gangliosides were undetectable in iPSCs and NCCs from both variants, while LacCer precursor levels were elevated compared to wildtype (WT). NCCs of both variants synthesized elevated levels of neutral lacto- and globo-series, as well as minor alternatively sialylated, GSLs compared to WT. Shifts in ceramide profiles associated with iPSC and NCC GSLs were also detected in GM3SD variants. Altered GSL profiles in the GM3SD cells were accompanied by dynamic changes in the cell surface proteome, protein O-GlcNAcylation, and receptor tyrosine kinase abundance. GM3SD cells also exhibited increased apoptosis and sensitivity to erlotnib, an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. Pharmacologic inhibition of O-GlcNAcase increased protein O-GlcNAcylation and significantly rescued baseline and erlotnib-induced apoptosis. Collectively, these findings indicate broad effects on cell signaling during differentiation of GM3SD patient-derived iPSCs to NCCs. Thus, human GM3SD cells provide a novel platform to investigate structure/function relationships that connect GSL diversity to cell signaling, cell survival, and neural differentiation.</p>', 'posted': '2021-07-30'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.07.22.453339', 'tweets': 3, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Evolutionary Biology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Segmenting biological specimens from photos to understand the evolution of UV plumage in passerine birds', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Yichen He'}, {'name': 'Christopher R.

A 500x-1000x higher CQ concentration is required in the DNA relaxation reaction (topoisomerase I) than in the agarose gel buffer to quench all negative supercoiling of pUC19 extracted from Escherichia coli. This is likely due to the dependence of both, the DNA binding affinity of CQ and the induced DNA unwinding angle, on the ionic strength of the buffer.

We measured vigour in a placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of trihexyphenidyl (THP), a muscarinic antagonist, with an incentivised eye movement task and EEG. Participants responded faster and with greater vigour when incentives were high, but THP blunted these motivation effects, suggesting that muscarinic receptors facilitate invigoration by reward. Preparatory EEG build-up (contingent negative variation; CNV) was strengthened by high incentives and by muscarinic blockade. The amplitude of preparatory activity predicted both vigour and RT, although over distinct scalp regions. Frontal activity predicted vigour, whereas a larger, earlier, central component predicted RT. Indeed the incentivisation of RT was partly mediated by the CNV, though vigour was not. Moreover, the CNV mediated the drug’s effect on dampening incentives, suggesting that muscarinic receptors underlie the motivational influence on this preparatory activity.
