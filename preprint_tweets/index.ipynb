In particular, Spike exerted a noticeable effect on the procoagulant phenotype of platelets, by enhancing calcium flux, phosphatidylserine externalisation, and thrombin generation.

Amyloid fibril assays of peptide library mixtures and theoretical predictions identified seven amyloidogenic sequences within the S-protein. All seven peptides in isolation formed aggregates during incubation at 37°C. Three 20-amino acid long synthetic Spike peptides (sequence 191-210, 599-618, 1165-1184) fulfilled three amyloid fibril criteria: nucleation dependent polymerization kinetics by ThT, Congo red positivity and ultrastructural fibrillar morphology. Full-length folded S-protein did not form amyloid fibrils, but amyloid-like fibrils with evident branching were formed during 24 hours of S-protein co-incubation with the protease neutrophil elastase (NE) in vitro. NE efficiently cleaved S-protein rendering exposure of amyloidogenic segments and accumulation of the peptide 193-202, part of the most amyloidogenic synthetic Spike peptide. NE is overexpressed at inflamed sites of viral infection and at vaccine injection sites.

Individuals display a wide range of responses to stress, which can manifest in a variety of outcomes for the brain as well as subsequent behavior. Chronic Social Defeat Stress (CSDS) in mice has been widely used to model individual variation following a social stressor. Following a course of repeated intermittent psychological and physical stress, mice diverge into separate populations of social reactivity: resilient (socially interactive) and susceptible (socially avoidant) animals. A rich body of work reveals distinct neurobiological and behavioral consequences of this experience that map onto the resilient and susceptible groups. However, the range of factors that emerge over the course of defeat have not been fully described. Therefore, in the current study, we focused on characterizing behavioral, physiological, and neuroendocrine profiles of mice in three separate phases: before, during, and following CSDS. We found that following CSDS, traditional read-outs of anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors do not map on to the resilient and susceptible groups. By contrast, behavioral coping strategies used during the initial social stress encounter better predict which mice will eventually become resilient or susceptible. In particular, mice that will emerge as susceptible display greater escape behavior on Day 1 of social defeat than those that will emerge as resilient, indicating early differences in coping mechanisms used between the two groups. We further show that the social avoidance phenotype in susceptible mice is specific to the aggressor strain and does not generalize to conspecifics or other strains, indicating that there may be features of threat discrimination that are specific to the susceptible mice. Our findings suggest that there are costs and benefits to both the resilient and susceptible outcomes, reflected in their ability to cope and adapt to the social stressor.</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-14'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.12.21267677', 'tweets': 51, 'archive': 'medRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Neurology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Artificial intelligence for diagnosis and prognosis in neuroimaging for dementia; a systematic review', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'R Borchert'}, {'name': 'T Azevedo'}, {'name': 'A Badhwar'}, {'name': 'J Bernal'}, {'name': 'M Betts'}, {'name': 'R Bruffaerts'}, {'name': 'MC Burkhart'}, {'name': 'I Dewachter'}, {'name': 'HM Gellersen'}, {'name': 'A Low'}, {'name': 'L Machado'}, {'name': 'CR Madan'}, {'name': 'M Malpetti'}, {'name': 'J Mejia'}, {'name': 'S Michopoulou'}, {'name': 'C Muñoz-Neira'}, {'name': 'M Peres'}, {'name': 'V Phillips'}, {'name': 'S Ramanan'}, {'name': 'S Tamburin'}, {'name': 'H Tantiangco'}, {'name': 'L Thakur'}, {'name': 'A Tomassini'}, {'name': 'A Vipin'}, {'name': 'E Tang'}, {'name': 'D Newby'}, {'name': 'J Ranson'}, {'name': 'D.J.

These measures of brain age, obtained from the general population, helped characterize disease severity in neurological populations, improving estimates of diagnosis or prognosis. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) have the potential to further generalize this approach towards prevention and public health by enabling assessments of brain health at large scales in socioeconomically diverse environments. However, more research is needed to define methods that can handle the complexity and diversity of M/EEG signals across diverse real-world contexts. To catalyse this effort, here we propose reusable benchmarks of competing machine learning approaches for brain age modeling. We benchmarked popular classical machine learning pipelines and deep learning architectures previously used for pathology decoding or brain age estimation in 4 international M/EEG cohorts from diverse countries and cultural contexts, including recordings from more than 2500 participants. Our benchmarks were built on top of the M/EEG adaptations of the BIDS standard, providing tools that can be applied with minimal modification on any M/EEG dataset provided in the BIDS format. Our results suggest that, regardless of whether classical machine learning or deep learning was used, the highest performance was reached by pipelines and architectures involving spatially aware representations of the M/EEG signals, leading to R^2 scores between 0.60-0.71. Hand-crafted features paired with random forest regression provided robust benchmarks even in situations in which other approaches failed. Taken together, this set of benchmarks, accompanied by open-source software and high-level Python scripts, can serve as a starting point and quantitative reference for future efforts at developing M/EEG-based measures of brain aging. The generality of the approach renders this benchmark reusable for other related objectives such as modeling specific cognitive variables or clinical endpoints.</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-16'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.14.472719', 'tweets': 48, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Microbiology', 'covid': True, 'title': 'Striking Antibody Evasion Manifested by the Omicron Variant of SARS-CoV-2', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Lihong Liu'}, {'name': 'Sho Iketani'}, {'name': 'Yicheng Guo'}, {'name': 'Jasper Fuk-Woo Chan'}, {'name': 'Maple Wang'}, {'name': 'Liyuan Liu'}, {'name': 'Yang Luo'}, {'name': 'Hin Chu'}, {'name': 'Yiming Huang'}, {'name': 'Manoj S.

This concern is amplified by the findings from our study.  We found B.1.1.529 to be markedly resistant to neutralization by serum not only from convalescent patients, but also from individuals vaccinated with one of the four widely used COVID-19 vaccines. Even serum from persons vaccinated and boosted with mRNA-based vaccines exhibited substantially diminished neutralizing activity against B.1.1.529.

Ideally sample overlap would be identified and removed directly, but this is typically not possible due to privacy laws or consent agreements.

Astrocytes are purported to play an active role in regulating DVC function and, by extension, physiological parameters. Previous work has demonstrated that DVC astrocytes directly sense hormones that regulate food intake and blood glucose and are critical for their effect. In addition, DVC astrocytes in ex vivo slices respond to low tissue glucose. The response of neurons, including catecholaminergic neurons, to low glucose is conditional on intact astrocyte signalling in slice preparations suggesting astrocytes are possibly the primary sensors of glucose deprivation (glucoprivation). Based on these findings we hypothesised that if DVC astrocytes act as glucoprivation sensors in vivo they would both show a response to systemic glucoprivation and drive physiological responses to restore blood glucose. We found that 2 hours of systemic glucoprivation induced neither FOS nor glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactivity in DVC astrocytes, specifically those in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Furthermore, we found that while chemogenetic activation of DVC astrocytes suppressed food intake by reducing both meal size and meal number, this manipulation also suppressed food intake under conditions of glucoprivation. Chemogenetic activation of DVC astrocytes did not increase basal blood glucose nor protect against insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. In male mice chemogenetic DVC astrocyte activation did not alter glucose tolerance, in female mice the initial glucose excursion was reduced, suggesting enhanced glucose absorption. Taken together this suggests that as a whole-population DVC astrocytes do not function as glucoprivation sensors in vivo in mice. Instead, we propose that DVC astrocytes play an indispensable, homeostatic role to maintain the function of glucoregulatory neuronal circuitry.</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-16'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.15.472866', 'tweets': 31, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Molecular Biology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Understanding the source of METTL3-independent m6A in mRNA', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Hui Xian Poh'}, {'name': 'Aashiq H Mirza'}, {'name': 'Brian F Pickering'}, {'name': 'Samie R Jaffrey'}]\", 'abstract': \"<p><italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is a highly prevalent mRNA modification which promotes degradation of transcripts encoding proteins that have roles in cell development, differentiation, and other pathways.

Numerical explorations allowed to link the evolutionary dynamics to the multiple parameters involved in this complex, multi-scale evolutionary process.

Here, we propose a general model for the evolutionary dynamics of species-rich communities, each described by disordered generalized Lotka-Volterra equations, that we study analytically and by numerical simulations.

Here, we use molecule counting and spike-in normalization to develop absolute scaling of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Absolute scaling enables an estimation of total transcript abundances per cell, which we validate in embryonic stem cell (ESC) and germline data and apply to adult mouse organs at steady-state or during regeneration. The results reveal a remarkable dynamic range in transcriptional output among adult cell types. We find that many different multipotent stem and progenitor cell populations are in a state of hypertranscription, including in the hematopoietic system, intestine and skin. Hypertranscription marks cells with multilineage potential in adult organs, is redeployed in conditions of tissue injury, and can precede by 1-2 days bursts of proliferation during regeneration. In addition to the association between hypertranscription and the stem/progenitor cell state, we dissect the relationship between transcriptional output and cell cycle, ploidy and secretory behavior. Our analyses reveal a common set of molecular pathways associated with hypertranscription across adult organs, including chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, ribosome biogenesis and translation.

Specimens were obtained within 1-2 hours after individuals had succumbed to critical illness associated with respiratory infections, with 4 of 8 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19. Control kidney tissues were obtained post-mortem or after nephrectomy from individuals without AKI. Results: High-depth single cell-resolved gene expression data of human kidneys affected by AKI revealed enrichment of novel injury-associated cell states within the major cell types of the tubular epithelium, in particular in proximal tubules, thick ascending limbs and distal convoluted tubules. Four distinct, hierarchically interconnected injured cell states were distinguishable and characterized by transcriptome patterns associated with oxidative stress, hypoxia, interferon response, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, respectively. Transcriptome differences between individuals with AKI were driven primarily by the cell type-specific abundance of these four injury subtypes rather than by private molecular responses.

Still, non-convergence is also common, and a major question is whether apparently idiosyncratic, lineage-specific evolutionary changes are reflective of chance events inherent to evolutionary processes, or whether they are also influenced by deterministic genetic or ecological factors. To address this question, we quantified the degree of convergence in genome-wide patterns of gene expression across lineages of livebearing fishes (family Poeciliidae) that span 40 million years of evolution and have colonized extreme environments in the form of toxic, hydrogen-sulfide-rich springs. We specifically asked whether the degree of convergence across lineage pairs was related to their phylogenetic relatedness or the ecological similarity of the habitats they inhabit. Using phylogenetic comparative analyses, we showed that the degree of convergence was highly variable across lineage pairs residing in sulfide springs. While closely related lineages did not exhibit higher degrees of convergence than distantly related ones, we uncovered a strong relationship between degree of convergence and ecological similarity. Our results indicate that variation in the degree of convergence is not merely noise associated with evolutionary contingency. Rather, cryptic environmental variation that is frequently ignored when we employ reductionist approaches can significantly contribute to adaptive evolution.

A strategy to prevent secondary cone death could provide a generalized RP therapy to preserve daylight color vision regardless of the underlying mutation. In mouse models of RP, cones in the far peripheral retina survive long-term, despite complete rod loss. The mechanism for such peripheral cone survival had not been explored. Here, we found that active retinoic acid (RA) signaling in peripheral Muller glia is both sufficient and necessary for the extended cone survival. RA depletion by conditional knockout of RA synthesis enzymes, or overexpression of an RA degradation enzyme, abrogated peripheral cone survival. Conversely, constitutive activation of RA signaling in the central retina promoted long-term cone survival. These results indicate that RA signaling mediates the prolonged peripheral cone survival in the rd1 mouse model of retinal degeneration, and provide a basis for a generic strategy for cone survival in the many diseases that lead to loss of cone-mediated vision.</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-16'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.16.472968', 'tweets': 18, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Biochemistry', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Structure of human CST-pol-α/primase bound to a telomeric overhang poised for initiation of telomere C-strand synthesis', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Qixiang He'}, {'name': 'Xiuhua Lin'}, {'name': 'Bianca L Chavez'}, {'name': 'Benjamin L Lusk'}, {'name': 'Ci Ji Lim'}]\", 'abstract': \"<p>Telomere replication and regulation protect mammalian chromosome ends and promote genome stability.

Mice can react to innately threatening stimuli in less than 250 milliseconds [1] and, in simple environments, use spatial memory to quickly escape to shelter [2,3]. Natural habitats, however, often offer multiple routes to safety which animals must rapidly identify and choose from to maximize the chances of survival [4]. This is challenging because while rodents can learn to navigate complex mazes to obtain rewards [5,6], learning the value of different routes through trial-and-error during escape from threat would likely be deadly. Here we have investigated how mice learn to choose between different escape routes to shelter. By using environments with paths to shelter of varying length and geometry we find that mice prefer options that minimize both path distance and path angle relative to the shelter. This choice strategy is already present during the first threat encounter and after only ~10 minutes of exploration in a novel environment, indicating that route selection does not require experience of escaping. Instead, an innate heuristic is used to assign threat survival value to alternative paths after rapidly learning the spatial environment. This route selection process is flexible and allows quick adaptation to arenas with dynamic geometries. Computational modelling of different classes of reinforcement learning agents shows that the observed behavior can be replicated by model-based agents acting in an environment where the shelter location is rewarding during exploration. These results show that mice combine fast spatial learning with innate heuristics to choose escape routes with the highest survival value. They further suggest that integrating priors acquired through evolution with knowledge learned from experience supports adaptation to changing environments while minimizing the need for trial-and-error when the errors are very costly.</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-15'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.14.21267810', 'tweets': 17, 'archive': 'medRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Genetic and Genomic Medicine', 'covid': True, 'title': 'Early detection and improved genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants from deep sequencing data', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Daniele Ramazzotti'}, {'name': 'Davide Maspero'}, {'name': 'Fabrizio Angaroni'}, {'name': 'Marco Antoniotti'}, {'name': 'Rocco Piazza'}, {'name': 'Alex Graudenzi'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>In the definition of fruitful strategies to contrast the worldwide diffusion of SARS-CoV-2, maximum efforts must be devoted to the early detection of dangerous variants.

We define a consensus set of mutations from 77 sequences assigned as Omicron in GISAID as of November 25. We create structural models of the Omicron S protein in the open and closed states, as part of a complex with ACE2 and for each of 77 complexes of S bound to different antibodies with known structures. We have previously utilized Dynamical Signatures (DS) and the Vibrational Entropy Score (VDS) to evaluate the propensity of S variants to favour the open state. Here, we introduce the Binding Influence Score (BIS) to evaluate the influence of mutations on binding affinity based on the net gain or loss of interactions within the protein-protein interface. BIS shows excellent correlation with experimental data (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87) on individual mutations in the ACE2 interface for the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron variants combined. On the one hand, the DS of Omicron highly favours a more rigid open state and a more flexible closed state with the largest VDS of all variants to date, suggesting a large increase in the chances to interact with ACE2. On the other hand, the BIS shows that apart from N501Y, all other mutations in the interface reduce ACE2 binding affinity. VDS and BIS show opposing effects on the overall effectiveness of Omicron mutations to promote binding to ACE2 and therefore initiate infection. To evaluate the propensity for immune escape we calculated the net change of favourable and unfavourable interactions within each S-antibody interface. The net change of interactions shows a positive score (a net increase of favourable interactions and decrease of unfavourable ones) for 41 out of 77 antibodies, a nil score for 15 and a negative score for 21 antibodies. Therefore, in only 28% of S-antibody complexes (21/77) we predict some level of immune escape due to a weakening of the interactions with Omicron S. Considering that most antibody epitopes and the mutations are within the S-ACE2 interface our results suggest that mutations within the RBD of Omicron may give rise to only partial immune escape, which comes at the expense of reduced ACE2 binding affinity. However, this reduced ACE2 affinity appears to have been offset by increasing the occupancy of the open state of the Spike protein.</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-15'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.13.472367', 'tweets': 16, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Neuroscience', 'covid': False, 'title': 'A neuron, microglia, and astrocyte triple coculture model to study Alzheimer disease', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Celia Luchena'}, {'name': 'Jone Zuazo-Ibarra'}, {'name': 'Jorge Valero'}, {'name': 'Carlos Matute'}, {'name': 'Elena Alberdi'}, {'name': 'Estibaliz Capetillo-Zarate'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>Glial cells are essential to understand Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression, given their role in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.

Neodermatan rhabodviruses also have an ancestral position to vertebrate-associated viruses, including Lyssaviruses, suggesting that vertebrate rhabdoviruses emerged from a flatworm rhabdovirus in a parasitized host.

Studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have identified a diverse set of molting-associated factors including signaling molecules, intracellular trafficking regulators, ECM components, and ECM-modifying enzymes such as matrix metalloproteases. C. elegans NEKL-2 and NEKL-3, two conserved members of the NEK family of protein kinases, are essential for molting and promote the endocytosis of environmental steroid-hormone precursors by the epidermis. Steroids in turn drive the cyclic induction of many genes required for molting. Here we report a novel role for the sole C. elegans ADAM-meltrin metalloprotease family member, ADM-2, as a negative regulator of molting. Whereas loss of adm-2 led to strong suppression of molting defects in partial loss-of-function nekl mutants, overexpression of ADM-2 induced molting defects in wild-type animals. CRISPR genome editing implicated the Zn-binding motif within the metalloprotease domain as critical for mediating the effects of ADM-2 on molting. ADM-2 is expressed in the epidermis, and its trafficking through the endo-lysosomal network was disrupted after NEKL depletion. We also identified the epidermally expressed low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, LRP-1, as a candidate target of ADM-2 regulation. Whereas loss of ADM-2 activity led to the upregulation of LRP-1, ADM-2 overexpression caused a reduction in LRP-1 abundance, suggesting that ADM-2 may function as a sheddase for LRP-1. We propose that loss of adm-2 suppresses molting defects in nekl mutants by eliminating a negative regulator of LRP-1, thereby compensating for defects in the efficiency of LRP-1 and sterol uptake. Our findings emphasize the importance of endocytic trafficking for both the internalization of factors that promote molting and the removal of proteins that would otherwise be deleterious to the molting process.\\n\\u2003</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-16'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.15.472773', 'tweets': 15, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Plant Biology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Regulation of effector gene expression as concerted waves in Leptosphaeria maculans: a two-players game', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Colin Clairet'}, {'name': 'Elise J Gay'}, {'name': 'Antoine Porquier'}, {'name': 'Françoise Blaise'}, {'name': 'Claire-Line Marais'}, {'name': 'Marie-Hélène Balesdent'}, {'name': 'Thierry Rouxel'}, {'name': 'Jessica L.

Here, we addressed the physiological relevance of the vegetative cell-specific Flv1A and Flv3A on the bioenergetic processes occurring in the diazotrophic Anabaena under variable CO2. We demonstrate that both Flv1A and Flv3A are required for proper induction of the Mehler-like reaction upon a sudden change in light intensity, which is likely important for the activation of carbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCM) and CO2 fixation. Nevertheless, Flv3A showed a more important role in photoprotection than Flv1A. Under low CO2 diazotrophic conditions, Flv3A is capable of mediating moderate O2 photoreduction, independently of Flv1A, but in coordination with Flv2 and Flv4. Strikingly, the lack of Flv3A resulted in strong downregulation of the heterocyst-specific uptake hydrogenase, which led to enhanced H2 photoproduction under both oxic and micro-oxic conditions.

While the nucleus, a large and stiff organelle, impedes cell migration between non-deformable pillars in vitro, its function in vivo may vary depending on the microenvironment. Further, it is unknown how nuclei contribute to collective migration in vivo and whether nuclei in different positions within cell collectives experience different forces. Here, we use border cell migration in the fly ovary as an in vivo model to investigate the effects of confined, collective migration on nuclei and the contribution of nuclear lamins to migration. We found severe yet transient nuclear deformations occur, particularly in the leading cell, as border cells squeeze through tiny crevices between germline cells, termed nurse cells. Leading cells extend protrusions between nurse cells, which may pry open space to allow the cluster to advance. Here we report that the leading cell nuclei deformed as they moved into leading protrusions. Then as protrusions widened, the nucleus recovered a more circular shape. These data suggest that lead cell nuclei may help protrusions expand and thereby enlarge the migration path. To test how nuclei might promote or impede border cell migration, we investigated nuclear lamins, proteins that assemble into intermediate filaments and structurally support the nuclear envelope. Depletion of the Drosophila B-type lamin, Lam, from the outer, motile border cells, but not the inner, nonmotile polar cells, impeded border cell migration, whereas perturbations of the A-type lamin, LamC, did not. While wild type border cell clusters typically have one large leading protrusion as they delaminate from the anterior follicular epithelium, clusters depleted of B-type lamin had multiple, short-lived protrusions, resulting in unproductive cluster movement and failure to progress along the migration path. Further, border cell nuclei depleted of B-type lamins were small, formed blebs, and ruptured. Together, these data indicate that B-type lamin is requied for nuclear integrity, which in turn stabilizes the leading protrusion and promotes overall cluster polarization and collective movement through confined spaces.</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-17'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.14.21267798', 'tweets': 10, 'archive': 'medRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Obstetrics and Gynecology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'The association between midwifery staffing levels and the experiences of mothers on postnatal wards: cross sectional analysis of routine data', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Lesley Turner'}, {'name': 'David Culliford'}, {'name': 'Jane Ball'}, {'name': 'Ellen Kitson-Reynolds'}, {'name': 'Peter Griffiths'}]\", 'abstract': '<sec><title>Background</title><p>Women have consistently reported lower satisfaction with postnatal care compared with antenatal and labour care.

Here we show that pathway-specific projection neurons in the medial PFC (mPFC) differentially contribute to context-instructed strategy selection. In a decision-making task in which mice have been trained to flexibly switch between a previously established rule and a newly learned rule in a context-dependent manner, the activity of mPFC neurons projecting to the dorsomedial striatum encodes the contexts, and further represents decision strategies conforming to the old and new rules. Moreover, the activity of these neuron is required for context-instructed strategy selection. In contrast, the activity of mPFC neurons projecting to the ventral midline thalamus does not discriminate between the contexts, and represents the old rule even if mice have adopted the new one; furthermore, these neurons act to prevent the strategy switch under the new rule. Our results suggest that the mPFC→striatum pathway promotes flexible strategy selection guided by contexts, whereas the mPFC→thalamus pathway favors fixed strategy selection by preserving old rules.

Biofilm-based hydroelectric current production was comparable to that achieved with similar sized biofilms catalyzing current production in microbial fuel cells,<sup>10,11</sup> without the need for an organic feedstock or maintaining cell viability.

Here, we characterized p166 as the only TAC subunit that is anchored in the inner membrane. Its C-terminal transmembrane domain separates the protein into a large N-terminal region that interacts with the kDNA-localized TAC102 and a 34 aa C-tail that binds to the intermembrane space-exposed loop of the integral outer membrane protein TAC60. Thus, in contrast to the outer membrane TAC region which requires four essential subunits for proper function a single inner membrane TAC subunit is sufficient to bridge the distance from the OM to the kDNA. Surprisingly, non-functional p166 lacking the C-terminal 34 aa still localizes to the TAC region. This suggests the existence of nonessential TAC-associated proteins in the OM.

However, the impact of environmental context on maternal care and milk quality has not been thoroughly evaluated, nor are the biological underpinnings of EE on offspring development understood. Here, Sprague-Dawley rats were housed and bred in either EE or standard-housed (SD) conditions. Although EE dams gave birth to a larger number of pups, litters were standardized and cross-fostered across groups on postnatal day (P)1. Maternal milk samples were then collected on P1 (transitional milk phase) and P10 (mature milk phase) for analysis. While EE dams spent less time nursing, postnatal enrichment exposure was associated with heavier offspring bodyweights. Moreover, milk from EE dams had increased triglyceride levels compared to SD dams. Milk from EE mothers also contained a greater microbiome diversity and a significantly higher abundance of bacterial families related to bodyweight and energy metabolism. In addition to changes in lactational quality, we observed sex- and time-dependent effects of EE on offspring social behavior. Specifically, prenatal EE exposure was associated with greater sociability in females, while postnatal EE was associated with greater sociability in male offspring. Together, these results underscore the multidimensional impact of the combined neonatal and maternal environments on offspring development.

The relationship between degree of closure of the LA binding pocket of the RBD, and monomer burial in the trimer, is examined for a range of spike protein structures, including those with D614G mutation, and that of the Delta variant (which also carries D614G).  Some spike protein structures with this aspartic acid mutation show monomer packing approaching that of the locked form (at neutral pH, without LA binding) for two segments, a third (around the RBD) remains less closely packed.

First, the gene flow mixes alleles adapted to different environments, potentially hindering (swamping) adaptation. Second, it inflates genetic variance: this aids adaptation to spatially (and temporally) varying environments but if selection is hard, it lowers the mean fitness of the population. Third, neighbourhood size, which determines how weak genetic drift is, increases with dispersal -- when genetic drift is strong, increase of neighbourhood size with dispersal aids adaptation. In this note I focus on the role of dispersal in environments which change smoothly across space, and when local populations are quite small such that genetic drift has a significant effect. Using individual-based simulations, I show that in small populations, even leptokurtic dispersal benefits adaptation, by reducing the power of genetic drift. This has implications for management of small marginal populations: increased gene flow appears beneficial as long as adaptations involves a quantitative, rather than a discrete, trait. However, heavily leptokurtic dispersal will swamp continuous adaptation along steep environmental gradients so that only patches of locally adapted subpopulations remain.</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-16'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.12.472307', 'tweets': 7, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Bioinformatics', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Scalable batch-correction approach for integrating large-scale single-cell transcriptomes', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Xilin Shen'}, {'name': 'Hongru Shen'}, {'name': 'Dan Wu'}, {'name': 'Mengyao Feng'}, {'name': 'Jiani Hu'}, {'name': 'Jilei Liu'}, {'name': 'Yichen Yang'}, {'name': 'Meng Yang'}, {'name': 'Yang Li'}, {'name': 'Lei Shi'}, {'name': 'Kexin Chen'}, {'name': 'Xiangchun Li'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>Integration of the evolving large-scale single-cell transcriptomes requires scalable batch-correction approaches.

The core idea of the method is encoding batch information of each cell as a trainable parameter and added to its expression profile; subsequently, a contrastive learning approach is used to learn feature representation of the additive expression profile. We demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method by integrating 18 million cells obtained from the Human Cell Atlas. Our benchmark comparisons with current state-of-the-art single-cell integration methods demonstrated that our method could achieve comparable data alignment and cluster preservation.

Models of cognitive mapping in neuroscience mostly depict map-learning as a process of random or biased diffusion. In practice, however, animals explore spaces using structured, purposeful, sensory-guided actions. Here we test the hypothesis that executing specific exploratory actions is a key strategy for building a cognitive map. Previous work has shown that in arenas with obstacles and a shelter, mice spontaneously learn efficient multi-step escape routes by memorizing allocentric subgoal locations. We thus used threat-evoked escape to probe the relationship between ethological exploratory behavior and allocentric spatial memory. Using closed-loop neural manipulations to interrupt running movements during exploration, we found that blocking runs targeting an obstacle edge abolished subgoal learning. In contrast, blocking other movements while sparing edge-directed runs had no effect on memorizing subgoals. Finally, spatial analyses suggest that the decision to use a subgoal during escape takes into account the mouse's starting position relative to the layout of the environment. We conclude that mice use an action-driven learning process to identify subgoals and that these subgoals are then integrated into a map-based planning process. We suggest a conceptual framework for spatial learning that is compatible with the successor representation from reinforcement learning and sensorimotor enactivism from cognitive science.</p>\", 'posted': '2021-12-16'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.13.472491', 'tweets': 7, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Cell Biology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Transcription Factor RFX3 Stabilizes Mammary Basal Cell Identity', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Erica M.

Transdifferentiation to the luminal lineage does not normally occur but can be induced by DNA damage, luminal cell death or transplantation into a recipient mammary fat pad. Myoepithelial cells cultivated in vitro can also transdifferentiate towards the luminal lineage. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms and gene regulatory networks underlying this plasticity. Using a transgenic mouse (Tg11.5kb-GFP) that marks cap cells with GFP, we discovered that mature myoepithelial cells placed in culture begin to express GFP within ∼24 hrs and later express the Keratin 8 (K8) luminal marker. Cell tracking showed that most K8+ cells arose from GFP+ cells, suggesting that myoepithelial cells de-differentiate towards a progenitor state before changing lineage. Differential gene expression analysis, comparing pure GFP+ cap cells with mature myoepithelial cells, identified multiple transcription factors that iRegulon predicted might regulate the myoepithelial to cap cell transition. Knockout of one of these genes, Regulatory Factor 3 (Rfx3), significantly reduced the population of GFP+ cells and increased differentiation to the K8+ luminal lineage. Rfx3 knockout also reduced mammosphere growth and mammary gland regeneration efficiency in a transplantation assay, but had no effect on proliferation in vitro. Together, these data support a key role for Rfx3 in the stabilization of the mammary basal cell lineages.</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-13'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.14.472705', 'tweets': 7, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Biochemistry', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Pseudomonas response regulators produced in an E. coli heterologous expression host exhibit host-derived post-translational phosphorylation', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Megan E.

This finding was supported by the detection of di-, mono- and unchlorinated dibenzo-<italic>p</italic>-dioxin. Microbial community analysis of sediments by 16S amplicon sequencing revealed an abundance of lineages from the class Dehalococcoidia (up to 15% of the community), including the genus <italic>Dehalobium</italic> (up to 0.5%).

Since online fMRI data processing cannot be equivalent to offline, we discussed the limitations of online analysis and their solutions in the RTPSpy implementation. We developed a fast and accurate anatomical image processing script with fast tissue segmentation (FastSeg), image alignment, and spatial normalization, utilizing the FastSurfer, AFNI, and ANTs. We confirmed that the FastSeg output was comparable with FreeSurfer, and could complete all the anatomical image processing in a few minutes. Thanks to its highly modular architecture, RTPSpy can easily be used for a simulation analysis to optimize a processing pipeline and target signal calculation. We present a sample script for building a real-time processing pipeline and running a simulation using RTPSpy. The library also offers a simple signal exchange mechanism with an external application. An external application can receive a real-time neurofeedback signal from RTPSpy in a background thread with a few lines of script. While the main components of the RTPSpy are the library modules, we also provide a GUI class for easy access to the RTPSpy functions.

To accommodate the rising number of critically ill patients, new intensive care units were formed in several hospitals. Here we describe the clinical presentation, patient characteristics, treatments and outcomes of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients in a newly formed COVID-19 ICU at a tertiary cardiac center in Sofia, Bulgaria.  \\n\\nMethods: This is a retrospective observational study of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients admitted to Sveta Ekaterina University Hospital in Sofia, Bulgaria, between November 4th, 2020 and January 6th, 2021. Data were collected from electronic and written patient records and charts. \\n\\nResults: We identified 38 critical care patients admitted with respiratory failure and treated with mechanical ventilation at our COVID-19 ICU during this period. The median age was 66 (IQR 57-76, range 27-89) and 74% were male. Most patients, 36 (95%), had at least one comorbidity. The most common comorbidities were hypertension, valvular heart disease, ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus. Overall, 27 (71%) patients had a concomitant cardiac disease other than hypertension and 24% were recent cardiac surgical patients. Inotropic support was required in 29 (76%) patients, renal replacement therapy in 12 (32%) patients and prone positioning and ECMO were used in 5 (13%) and 2 (5%) patients respectively. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 7.5 (IQR 5-14) days overall and 9 (IQR 6-13) days for survivors. At 30-days 28 (74%) of patients had died.

In our setting, mortality in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation was very high at 85%. There may be several factors contributing to these results, namely the predominance of cardiovascular comorbidities in our patient population, the strained ICU capacity and the lack of medical personnel to provide adequate intensive care to such complex patients.</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-17'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.16.472997', 'tweets': 6, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Neuroscience', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Dopamine and GPCR-mediated modulation of DN1 clock neurons gates the circadian timing of sleep', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Matthias Schlichting'}, {'name': 'Shlesha Richhariya'}, {'name': 'Nicholas Herndon'}, {'name': 'Dingbang Ma'}, {'name': 'Jason Xin'}, {'name': 'William Lenh'}, {'name': 'Katharine Abruzzi'}, {'name': 'Michael Rosbash'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>The metronome-like circadian regulation of sleep timing must still adapt to an uncertain environment.

The activity regulated cytoskeleton associated (Arc) gene has received wide attention as an IEG implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory. Yet, to date, the transcriptional dynamics of Arc in response to compartment and input-specific activity is unclear. By developing a knock-in mouse to fluorescently tag Arc alleles, we studied real-time transcription dynamics after stimulation of dentate granule cells (GCs) in acute hippocampal slices. To our surprise, we found that Arc transcription displayed distinct temporal kinetics depending on the activation of excitatory inputs that convey functionally distinct information, i.e. medial and lateral perforant paths (MPP and LPP, respectively). Moreover, the transcriptional dynamics of Arc after synaptic stimulation was similar to direct activation of GCs, although the contribution of ionotropic glutamate receptors, L-type voltage gated calcium channel, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) differed. Specifically, we observed an ER-mediated synapse-to-nucleus signal that supported elevations in nuclear calcium, and rapid induction of Arc transcription following MPP stimulation. However, activation of LPP inputs displayed lower nuclear calcium rise, which could underlie the delayed transcriptional onset of Arc.

However, there is variability in susceptibility to the psychiatric risk conferred by MIA, likely influenced by genetic factors. How MIA interacts with a genetic profile susceptible to SZ is challenging to test in animal models. To address this gap, we examined whether differential gene expression responses occur in forebrain-lineage neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) generated from three individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and three healthy controls. Following acute (24 hour) treatment with either interferon-gamma (IFNγ; 25 ng/μl) or interleukin (IL)-1β (10 ng/μl), we identified, by RNA sequencing, 3380 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the IFNγ-treated control lines (compared to untreated controls), and 1980 DEGs in IFNγ-treated SZ lines (compared to untreated SZ lines). Of these, 359 genes responded differently to IFNγ treatment in SZ relative to control lines, which were enriched for genes differentially expressed in adult SZ cases and in pathways related to the regulation of antigen processing, neuronal post-synaptic density, and the presynapse. There were no differentially expressed genes in the IL-1β-treatment conditions after Benjamini-Hochberg correction.

While prior studies have shown that attention enhances visual responses, we lack a cohesive understanding of how selective attention modulates visual representations across the brain.

Our data reveal three main findings. First, when two objects are simultaneously viewed, the category of the attended object can be decoded more readily than the category of the ignored object, with the greatest attentional enhancements observed in occipital and temporal lobes. Second, after accounting for the response to the stimulus, the correlation in the residual brain activity between a cortical region and a category-selective region of VTC was elevated when that region's preferred category was attended vs. ignored, and more so in the right occipital, parietal, and frontal cortices. Third, we found that the stronger the residual correlations between a given region of cortex and VTC, the better visual category information could be decoded from that region. These findings suggest that heightened residual correlations by selective attention may reflect the sharing of information between sensory regions and higher-order cortical regions to provide attentional enhancement of goal-relevant information.</p>\", 'posted': '2021-12-16'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.17.472408', 'tweets': 5, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Bioinformatics', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Fully Automatic Cell Segmentation with Fourier Descriptors', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Dominik Hirling'}, {'name': 'Peter Horvath'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>Cell segmentation is a fundamental problem in biology for which convolutional neural networks yield the best results nowadays.

The Staphylococcus aureus was identified on the basis of colony morphology, Gram's stain, biochemical tests (catalase and coagulase tests) and molecular identification through PCR amplification. Methodology: A total of 26 samples were recovered out of the 31 samples. Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility test was used to determine the sensitivity or resistance of S. aureus to methicillin. Out of the 26 strains, 4 were highly resistant, 10 were moderately resistant and 12 strains were sensitive. Three different protocols (Tube Method, Congo Red Agar Method and Tissue Culture plate method) were used for the detection of biofilm formation for both resistant and sensitive strains. Result: Comparative analysis of the antibiotic susceptibility and biofilm formation by different protocols showed that 70% strains that are resistant to antibiotic methicillin produced moderate-strong biofilms. 50% have produced the moderate-strong biofilms in all 3 protocols. In case of sensitive, 50% strains had produced none-weak biofilms in all 3 protocols.

While galvanotaxis has been studied in other cilitates, C. hirtus exhibit properties not found elsewhere, such as biomineralization-processes of alveolar plates with impact on the intracellular calcium regulation and a bimodal resting membrane potential, which leads unique electrophysiological driven bimodal swimming dynamics. Here, we statistically analyze the galvanotactic dynamics of C. hirtus by automated cell tracking routines. We found that the number of cells that show a galvanotactic response, increases with the increase of the applied electric field strength with a mean at about 2.1 V/cm. The spatiotemporal swimming dynamics change and lead to a statistical increase of linear elongated cell trajectories that point toward the cathode. Further, the increase of the electric fields decreases the mean velocity variance for electric fields larger than about 1.3 V/cm, while showing no significant change in the absolute velocity for any applied electric field. Fully functional galvanotactic responses were observed at a minimum extracellular calcium concentration of 20 μM. The results add important insights to the current understanding of cellular dynamics of ciliates and suggest that the currently accepted model lags the inclusion of the swimming dynamics and the complex calcium regulatory system of the cell.

Salvaging, the process of ‘recycling and reusing’, can be a metabolically efficient route to obtain access to required resources. Here, we show experimentally how precursor salvaging in engineered <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> populations can lead to stable, long-term metabolite provisioning. We find that salvaged cobamides (vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and related enzyme cofactors) are readily made available to non-productive population members, yet salvagers are strongly protected from overexploitation due to partial metabolite privatization. We also describe a previously unnoted benefit of precursor salvaging, namely the removal of the non-functional, proliferation-inhibiting precursor. As long as compatible precursors are present, any microbe possessing the terminal steps of a biosynthetic process can, in principle, forgo <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis in favor of salvaging. Consequently, precursor salvaging likely represents a potent, yet overlooked, alternative to <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis for the acquisition and provisioning of metabolites in free-living bacterial populations.</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-14'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.12.472204', 'tweets': 5, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Bioinformatics', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Black chromatin is indispensable for accurate simulations of Drosophila melanogaster chromatin structure', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Irina Tuszynska'}, {'name': 'Pawel Bednarz'}, {'name': 'Bartek Wilczynski'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>The interphase chromatin structure is extremely complex, precise and dynamic.

Further investigation in translationally-blocked (TB), non-growing cells showed that Mn supplementation (20 μM) led to approximately 1.5X faster acidification compared to Mn-free conditions.

Conversely, without manganese, non-growing cells persisted to acidify for weeks, albeit at a reduced rate, but maintaining redox balance and culturability. Strikingly, despite being unculturable, α-keto acid-derived aldehydes continued to accumulate in cells incubated in the presence of manganese, whereas without manganese cells predominantly formed the corresponding alcohols. This is most likely reflecting NADH availability for the alcohol dehydrogenase-catalyzed conversion. Overall, manganese influences the lactococcal acidification rate, and flavor formation capacity in a redox dependent manner.

This is because the gluteus and posterior thighs of koalas are the areas where previous studies have been particularly inconsistent. We dissected five individual koalas and clarified discrepancies in previous studies, as well as investigated the unique muscle morphology and their function in koalas. Specifically, the koala’s gluteal muscle group is suitable for abduction, while the posterior thigh muscles are particularly suitable for flexion. In the future, we will update the anatomical findings of marsupials in the same way to clarify the adaptive dissipation process of marsupials, as well as to contribute to the understanding of the evolutionary morphology of mammals.</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-13'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.15.472660', 'tweets': 4, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Microbiology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Differential Impact of rhamnolipids and TWEEN80 on composition and functionality of the gut microbiota in the SHIME system', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Lisa Miclotte'}, {'name': 'Ellen De Paepe'}, {'name': 'Qiqiong Li'}, {'name': 'John Van Camp'}, {'name': 'Andreja Raikovic'}, {'name': 'Tom Van de Wiele'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>Dietary emulsifiers have been shown to affect the composition and function of the gut microbial community, both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Here we have found two p97 cofactors, Ubxn7 and Faf1, which can interact with p97 during replisome disassembly in S-phase. Only Ubxn7 however facilitates efficient replisome disassembly through its interaction with both Cul2Lrr1 and p97. Our data therefore characterise Ubxn7 as the first substrate-specific p97 cofactor regulating replisome disassembly in vertebrates.</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-16'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.16.472944', 'tweets': 3, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Biochemistry', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Understanding p300-transcription factor interactions using sequence variation and hybridization', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Fruzsina Hobor'}, {'name': 'Zsofia Hegedus'}, {'name': 'Amaurys Avila Ibarra'}, {'name': 'Vencel L.

While many BOE relationships have been recently revealed experimentally, the BOE of mitosis regulators (BOE-M) has been scarcely reported and how this occurs remains largely unknown. Here, by mutagenesis and subsequent evolutionary repair experiments, we isolated viable fission yeast strains that lacked the entire coding region of Polo-like kinase (Plk), a versatile essential mitotic kinase. The BOE of Plk was enabled by specific mutations in the downstream machinery, including the MT-nucleating gamma-tubulin complex, and more surprisingly, through downregulation of glucose uptake, which is not readily connected to mitosis. The latter bypass was dependent on casein kinase I (CK1), which has not been considered as a major mitotic regulator. Our genetic and phenotypic data suggest that CK1 constitutes an alternative mechanism of MT nucleation, which is normally dominated by Plk. A similar relationship was observed in a human colon cancer cell line. Thus, our study shows that BOE-M can be achieved by simple genetic or environmental changes, consistent with the occurrence of BOE-M during evolution. Furthermore, the identification of BOE-M constitutes a powerful means to uncover a hitherto under-studied mechanism driving mitosis and also hints at the limitations and solutions for selecting chemotherapeutic compounds targeting mitosis.</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-16'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.15.472789', 'tweets': 3, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Microbiology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Soluble MAC is primarily released from MAC-resistant bacteria that potently convert complement component C5', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Dennis J.

We applied a novel EEG approach, which combines electroencephalographic with 3D-body tracking technology to measure brain-gait dynamics with millisecond precision while participants are in motion. Twenty-six participants (mean age = 74.9 years) with cognitive and everyday functional profiles within the normal range for their age and sex were ranked for risk of cognitive impairment. We used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment battery, a global index of cognition with a range from 0 to 30, to classify individuals as being at higher (22-26) and lower risk (27+). Individuals walking on a treadmill were exposed to visual perturbation designed to destabilize gait. Assuming that brain changes precede behavioral decline, we predicted that older adults increase step width to gain stability, yet the underlying neural signatures would be different for lower versus higher risk individuals. When pooling across risk groups, we found that step width increased and fronto-parietal activation shifted from transient, during swing phases, to sustained across the gait cycle during visually perturbed input. As predicted, step width increased in both groups but underlying neural signatures were different. Fronto-medial theta (3-7Hz) power of gait-related brain oscillations were increased in higher risk individuals during both perturbed and unperturbed inputs. On the other hand, left central gyri beta (13-28Hz) power was decreased in lower risk individuals, specifically during visually perturbed input.

Stronger reliance on frontomedial theta activation in at-risk individuals may reflect higher-order compensatory responses for deterioration of basic sensorimotor processes.

We sought a new evolutionary perspective for Salvia by employing macroevolutionary analyses to address the tempo and mode of diversification. To study the association of floral traits with speciation and extinction, we modeled and explored the evolution of corolla length and the lever-mechanism pollination system across our Salvia phylogeny. \\nMethods: We reconstructed a multigene phylogeny for 366 species of Salvia in the broad sense including all major recognized lineages and numerous species from Iran, a region previously overlooked in studies of the genus. Our phylogenetic data in combination with divergence time estimates were used to examine the evolution of corolla length, woody vs. herbaceous habit, and presence vs. absence of a lever mechanism. We investigated the timing and dependence of Salvia diversification related to corolla length evolution through a disparity test and BAMM analysis. A HiSSE model was used to evaluate the dependency of diversification on the lever-mechanism pollination system in Salvia.\\nKey Results: Based on recent investigations and classifications, Salvia is monophyletic and comprises ~1000 species. Our inclusion, for the first time, of a comprehensive sampling for Iranian species of Salvia provides higher phylogenetic resolution for southwestern Asian species than obtained in previous studies. A medium corolla length (15-18mm) was reconstructed as the ancestral state for Salvia with multiple shifts to shorter and longer corollas. Macroevolutionary model analyses indicate that corolla length disparity is high throughout Salvia evolution, significantly different from expectations under a Brownian motion model during the last 28 million years of evolution. Our analyses show evidence of a higher diversification rate of corolla length for some Andean species of Salvia compared to other members of the genus. Based on our tests of diversification models, we reject the hypothesis of a direct effect of the lever mechanism on Salvia diversification.\\nConclusions: Using a broader species sampling than previous studies, we obtained a well-resolved phylogeny for southwest Asian species of Salvia. Corolla length is an adaptive trait throughout the Salvia phylogeny with a higher rate of diversification in the South American clade. Our results suggest caution in considering the lever-mechanism pollination system as one of the main drivers of speciation in Salvia.</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-17'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.16.473085', 'tweets': 3, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Bioengineering', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Amino acid substitutions in human growth hormone affect coiled-coil content and receptor binding', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Andrei Rajkovic'}, {'name': 'Sandesh Kanchugal'}, {'name': 'Eldar Abdurakhmanov'}, {'name': 'Rebecca Howard'}, {'name': 'Astrid Gräslund'}, {'name': 'Sebastian Wärmländer'}, {'name': 'Joseph Erwin'}, {'name': 'Helena Ursula Danielson'}, {'name': 'Samuel Coulbourn Flores'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>The interaction between human Growth Hormone (hGH) and hGH Receptor (hGHR) has great relevance to human diseases such as acromegaly and cancer.

We find that, while many successfully slow down dissociation of the hGH-hGHR complex once bound, they also slow down the association of hGH to hGHR. We are particularly interested in E174 which belongs to the hGH zinc-binding triad, and which spans coiled-coil helices and obeys the coiled-coil heptad pattern.

E174A is known to increase affinity of hGH against hGHR; here we show that this is simply because the off-rate is slowed down more than the on-rate, in line with what has been found for other affinity-improving mutations. For E174Y (and mutations at other sites) the slowdown in on-rate was greater, leading to decreased affinity.

Furthermore, the subsequent cut in government support, alongside increases in the cost of living may widen economic inequalities for differential pre-pandemic psychological distress trajectories, which in turn may also worsen mental health. This work highlights, different pre-pandemic trajectories of psychological distress were more vulnerable to economic shock.</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-14'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.16.473074', 'tweets': 3, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Cell Biology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Caveolae mediated endocytosis of VLDL particles in macrophages requires NPC1 and STARD3 for further lysosomal processing', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Lei Deng'}, {'name': 'Frank Vrieling'}, {'name': 'Rinke Stienstra'}, {'name': 'Guido Hooiveld'}, {'name': 'Anouk L.

Triglycerides are carried in the bloodstream as part of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicrons. How macrophages take up and process VLDL-lipids is not very well known. Here, using VLDL-sized triglyceride-rich emulsion particles, we aimed to study the mechanism by which VLDL-triglycerides are taken up, processed, and stored in macrophages. Our results show that macrophage uptake of emulsion particles mimicking VLDL (VLDLm) is dependent on lipoproteins lipase (LPL) and requires the lipoprotein-binding C-terminal domain of LPL but not the catalytic N-terminal domain. Subsequent internalization of VLDLm-triglycerides by macrophages is carried out by caveolae-mediated endocytosis, followed by triglyceride hydrolysis catalyzed by lysosomal acid lipase. Transfer of lysosomal fatty acids to the ER for subsequent storage as triglycerides is mediated by Stard3, whereas NPC1 was found to promote the extracellular efflux of fatty acids from lysosomes. Our data provide novel insights into how macrophages process VLDL-derived triglycerides and suggest that macrophages have the remarkable capacity to excrete part of the internalized triglycerides as fatty acids.</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-17'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.13.472378', 'tweets': 3, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Systems Biology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Water droplet-in-oil digestion method for single-cell proteomics', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Takeshi Masuda'}, {'name': 'Yuma Inamori'}, {'name': 'Arisu Furukawa'}, {'name': 'Kazuki Momosaki'}, {'name': 'Chih-Hsiang Chang'}, {'name': 'Daiki Kobayashi'}, {'name': 'Hiroto Ohguchi'}, {'name': 'Yawara Kawano'}, {'name': 'Shingo Ito'}, {'name': 'Norie Araki'}, {'name': 'Shao-En Ong'}, {'name': 'Sumio Ohtsuki'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>Recent advances in single-cell proteomics highlight the promise of sensitive analyses in limited cell populations.

This method increased protein and peptide recovery 10-fold as well as the number of quantified transmembrane proteins compared to an in-solution digestion (ISD) method.

For instance, cells decide which enzymes to produce at what quantity, but also where to position them. Here we focus on the spatial allocation problem of how to distribute enzymes such as to maximize the total reaction flux produced by them in a system with given geometry and boundary conditions. So far, such distributions have been studied by computational optimization, but a deeper theoretical understanding was lacking. We derive an optimal allocation principle, which demands that the available enzymes are distributed such that the marginal flux returns at each occupied position are equal. This ‘homogeneous marginal returns criterion’ (HMR criterion) corresponds to a portfolio optimization criterion in a scenario where each investment globally feeds back onto all payoffs. The HMR criterion allows us to analytically understand and characterize a localization-delocalization transition in the optimal enzyme distribution that was previously observed numerically. In particular, our analysis reveals the generality of the transition, and produces a practical test for the optimality of enzyme localization by comparing the reaction flux to the influx of substrate. Based on these results, we devise an additive construction algorithm, which builds up optimal enzyme arrangements systematically rather than by trial and error. Taken together, our results reveal a common principle in allocation problems from biology and economics, which can also serve as a design principle for synthetic biomolecular systems.</p>', 'posted': '2021-12-17'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.12.12.472268', 'tweets': 3, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Bioinformatics', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Contrastive Cycle Adversarial Autoencoders for Single-cell Multi-omics Alignment and Integration', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Xuesong Wang'}, {'name': 'Zhihang Hu'}, {'name': 'Tingyang Yu'}, {'name': 'Ruijie Wang'}, {'name': 'Yumeng Wei'}, {'name': 'Juan Shu'}, {'name': 'Jianzhu Ma'}, {'name': 'Yu Li'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>Muilti-modality data are ubiquitous in biology, especially that we have entered the multi-omics era, when we can measure the same biological object (cell) from different aspects (omics) to provide a more comprehensive insight into the cellular system. When dealing with such multi-omics data, the first step is to determine the correspondence among different modalities. In other words, we should match data from different spaces corresponding to the same object. This problem is particularly challenging in the single-cell multi-omics scenario because such data are very sparse with extremely high dimensions. Secondly, matched single-cell multi-omics data are rare and hard to collect. Furthermore, due to the limitations of the experimental environment, the data are usually highly noisy. To promote the single-cell multi-omics research, we overcome the above challenges, proposing a novel framework to align and integrate single-cell RNA-seq data and single-cell ATAC-seq data. Our approach can efficiently map the above data with high sparsity and noise from different spaces to a low-dimensional manifold in a unified space, making the downstream alignment and integration straightforward. Compared with the other state-of-the-art methods, our method performs better in both simulated and real single-cell data. The proposed method is helpful for the single-cell multi-omics research.
