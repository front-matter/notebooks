This emerging phenomenon was undeniable yet understudied. We investigated menstrual bleeding patterns among currently and formerly menstruating people, with a research design based off our expectations that these bleeding changes related to changes in clotting or inflammation, affecting normal menstrual repair. In this sample, 42% of people with regular menstrual cycles bled more heavily than usual, while 44% reported no change, after being vaccinated. Among people who typically do not menstruate, 71% of people on long-acting reversible contraceptives, 39% of people on gender-affirming hormones, and 66% of post-menopausal people reported breakthrough bleeding.

In this study, we determined the whole genomes of nine Japanese wolves from the 19<sup>th</sup>- early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries and 11 Japanese dogs and analyzed them along with both modern and ancient wolves and dogs. Genomic analyses indicate that the Japanese wolf was a unique subspecies of the gray wolf that was genetically distinct from both modern and ancient gray wolves, lacking gene flow with other gray wolves. A Phylogenetic tree that minimizes the effects of introgression shows that Japanese wolves are closest to the dog monophyletic group among the gray wolves. Moreover, Japanese wolves show significant genetic affinities with East Eurasian dogs. We estimated the level of introgression from the ancestor of the Japanese wolves to the ancestor of East Eurasian dogs that had occurred in the transitional period from the Pleistocene to the Holocene, at an early stage after divergence from West Eurasian dog lineages. Because of this introgression, Japanese wolf ancestry has been inherited by many dogs through admixture between East Eurasian dog lineages. As a result of this heredity, up to 5.5% of modern dog genomes throughout East Eurasia are derived from Japanese wolf ancestry.</p>', 'posted': '2021-10-11'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.10.16.464636', 'tweets': 88, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Plant Biology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Automatic identification and annotation of MYB gene family members in plants', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Boas Pucker'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>Background: MYBs are among the largest transcription factor families in plants. Consequently, members of this family are involved in a plethora of processes including development and specialized metabolism. The MYB families of many plant species were investigated in the last two decades since the first investigation looked at Arabidopsis thaliana. This body of knowledge and characterized sequences provide the basis for the identification, classification, and functional annotation of candidate sequences in new genome and transcriptome assemblies.\\nResults: A pipeline for the automatic identification and functional annotation of MYBs in a given sequence data set was implemented in Python. MYB candidates are identified, screened for the presence of a MYB domain and other motifs, and finally placed in a phylogenetic context with well characterized sequences. In addition to technical benchmarking based on existing annotation, the transcriptome assembly of Croton tiglium and the annotated genome sequence of Castanea crenata were screened for MYBs. Results of both analyses are presented in this study to illustrate the potential of this application. The analysis of one species takes only a few minutes depending on the number of predicted sequences and the size of the MYB gene family. This pipeline, the required bait sequences, and reference sequences for a classification are freely available on github: https://github.com/bpucker/MYB_annotator.\\nConclusions: This automatic annotation of the MYB gene family in novel assemblies makes genome-wide investigations consistent and paves the way for comparative studies in the future. Candidate genes for in-depth analyses are presented based on their orthology to previously characterized sequences which allows the functional annotation of the newly identified MYBs with high confidence. The identification of orthologs can also be harnessed to detect duplication and deletion events.</p>', 'posted': '2021-10-16'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.10.12.464039', 'tweets': 72, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Molecular Biology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Histone H1 regulates non-coding RNA turnover on chromatin in a m6A-dependent manner', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'José Miguel Fernández-Justel'}, {'name': 'Cristina Santa-María'}, {'name': 'Alberto Ferrera-Lagoa'}, {'name': 'Mónica Salinas-Pena'}, {'name': 'Magdalena M.

In addition, it has been long proposed that histone H1 exerts context-specific effects on gene expression. Here, we have identified a new function of histone H1 in chromatin structure and transcription using a range of genomic approaches. We show that histone H1-depleted cells accumulate nascent non-coding RNAs on chromatin, suggesting that histone H1 prevents non-coding RNA transcription and regulates non-coding transcript turnover on chromatin. Accumulated non-coding transcripts have reduced levels of m6A modification and cause replication-transcription conflicts. Accordingly, altering the m6A RNA methylation pathway rescues the replicative phenotype of H1 loss. This work unveils unexpected regulatory roles of histone H1 on non-coding RNA turnover and m6A deposition, highlighting the intimate relationship between chromatin conformation, RNA metabolism and DNA replication to maintain genome performance.</p>', 'posted': '2021-10-12'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.10.08.463334', 'tweets': 44, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Genomics', 'covid': True, 'title': 'Covid-19 genomic analysis reveals clusters of emerging sublineages within the delta variant', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Evans K.

Genomic surveillance provides an opportunity to detect and characterize new mutations early enough for effective deployment of control strategies. Here, genomic data from Germany and United Kingdom were examined for genetic diversity by assessing gene mutations and inferring phylogeny. Delta variant sublineages were grouped into seven distinct clusters of spike mutations located in N-terminal domain of S1 region (T95I, D138H, *D142G, Y145H and A222V) and S2 region (T719I and *N950D). The most predominant cluster was T95I mutation, with the highest frequencies (71.1% - 83.9%) in Wales, England and Scotland, and the least frequencies (8.9% - 12.1%) in Germany. Two mutations, *D142G and *N950D here described as *reverse mutations and T719I mutation, were largely unique to Germany. In a month, frequencies of D142G had increased from 55.6% to 67.8 % in Germany. Additionally, a cluster of D142G+T719I/T mutation went up from 27.7% to 34.1%, while a T95I+ D142G+N950D/N cluster rose from 19.2% to 26.2%. Although, two distinct clusters of T95I+D138H (2.6% - 3.8%) and T95I+Y145H+A222V (2.5% - 8.5%) mutations were present in all the countries, they were most predominant in Wales and Scotland respectively. Results suggest divergent evolutionary trajectories between the clusters of D142G mutation and those of T95I mutation.

Here, we report that NFE2L1 expression inhibits ferroptosis, independent of NFE2L2. NFE2L1 inhibits ferroptosis by promoting expression of the key anti-ferroptotic lipid hydroperoxidase glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). NFE2L1 abundance and function are regulated post-translationally by N-glycosylation. Functional maturation of NFE2L1 requires deglycosylation by cytosolic peptide:N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1). We find that loss of NGLY1 or NFE2L1 enhances ferroptosis sensitivity. Expression of wild-type NGLY1 but not a disease-associated NGLY1 mutant inhibits ferroptosis, and this effect is dependent on the presence of NFE2L1. Enhanced ferroptosis sensitivity in NFE2L1 and NFE2L2 knockout cells can be potently reverted by expression of an NFE2L1 mutant containing eight asparagine-to-aspartate protein sequence substitutions, which mimic NGLY1-catalyzed sequence editing. Enhanced ferroptosis sensitivity in NGLY1/NFE2L1 pathway mutants could also be reversed by overexpression of NFE2L2.

NFE2L1/NRF1 is a cap’n’collar (CNC) transcription factor whose role in ferroptosis regulation is unclear. Unlike the CNC family member NFE2L2/NRF2, NFE2L1 is an N-glycoprotein whose abundance is regulated by post-translational deglycosylation catalyzed by the enzyme peptide:N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1). Our results indicate that NGLY1-mediated NFE2L1 deglycosylation, resulting in ‘editing’ of the NFE2L1 amino acid sequence, is necessary for NFE2L1 to inhibit ferroptosis. Mechanistically, NFE2L1 inhibits ferroptosis by via the anti-ferroptotic protein GPX4. This work demonstrates that CNC transcription factors beyond NFE2L2 can regulate ferroptosis.

Moreover, <italic>nup60</italic> mutants phenocopy <italic>nup2</italic> mutants, exhibiting similar nuclear division kinetics, sporulation efficiencies, and genetic interactions with mutations that affect the telomere bouquet. Although full-length Nup60 requires Nup2 for function, removal of Nup60’s C-terminus allows Nup60 to bind meiotic chromosomes and promote sporulation without Nup2. In contrast, binding of the MAR to meiotic chromosomes is completely dependent on Nup60. Our findings uncover an inhibitory function for the Nup60 C-terminus and suggest that Nup60 mediates recruitment of meiotic chromosomes to the nuclear envelope, while Nup2 plays a secondary role counteracting Nup60’s autoinhibition.</p>', 'posted': '2021-10-13'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.10.15.464515', 'tweets': 7, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Neuroscience', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Spatial signatures of anesthesia-induced burst-suppression differ between primates and rodents', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Nikoloz Sirmpilatze'}, {'name': 'Judith Mylius'}, {'name': 'Michael Ortiz-Rios'}, {'name': 'Jürgen Baudewig'}, {'name': 'Jaakko Paasonen'}, {'name': 'Daniel Golkowski'}, {'name': 'Andreas Ranft'}, {'name': 'Rüdiger Ilg'}, {'name': 'Olli Gröhn'}, {'name': 'Susann Boretius'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>During deep anesthesia, the electroencephalographic (EEG) signal of the brain alternates between bursts of activity and periods of relative silence (suppressions).

Besides RIG-I, irradiation is known to induce cytotoxic DNA damage resulting in tumor debulking followed by the induction of tumor-specific immunity. To date, it is unclear whether the molecular antitumor effects of RIG-I and irradiation are additive or even synergize. Here, we investigated the combination of RIG-I activation with radiotherapy in melanoma. We found that low dose x-ray irradiation enhanced the extent and immunogenicity of RIG-I mediated tumor cell death in human and murine melanoma cell lines and in the murine B16 melanoma model in vivo. Pathway analysis of transcriptomic data revealed a central role for p53 downstream of the combined treatment, which was corroborated using p53-/- B16 cells. In vivo, the additional effect of irradiation on immune cell activation and inhibition of tumor growth was lost in mice carrying p53-knockout B16 tumors, while the response to RIG-I stimulation in those mice was maintained. Thus, our results identify p53 as pivotal for the synergy of RIG-I with irradiation, resulting in potent induction of immunogenic tumor cell death.

With recurrent genomic selection, candidates can be evaluated based on genomic estimated breeding values indefinitely, therefore facilitating overlapping generations. Candidates with true high breeding values that were discarded in one cycle due to underestimation of breeding value could be identified and selected in subsequent cycles. The consequences of allowing generations to overlap in recurrent selection are unknown. We assessed whether maintaining overlapping and discrete generations led to differences in genetic gain for phenotypic, genomic truncation, and genomic optimum contribution recurrent selection by simulation of traits with various heritabilities and genetic architectures across fifty breeding cycles. We also assessed differences of overlapping and discrete generations in a conventional breeding scheme with multiple stages and cohorts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With phenotypic selection, overlapping generations led to decreased genetic gain compared to discrete generations due to increased selection error bias. Selected individuals, which were in the upper tail of the distribution of phenotypic values, tended to also have high absolute error relative to their true breeding value compared to the overall population. Without repeated phenotyping, these individuals erroneously believed to have high value were repeatedly selected across cycles, leading to decreased genetic gain. With genomic truncation selection, overlapping and discrete generations performed similarly as updating breeding values precluded repeatedly selecting individuals with inaccurately high estimates of breeding values in subsequent cycles. Overlapping generations did not outperform discrete generations in the presence of a positive genetic trend with genomic truncation selection, as past generations had lower mean genetic values than the current generation of selection candidates. With genomic optimum contribution selection, overlapping and discrete generations performed similarly, but overlapping generations slightly outperformed discrete generations in the long term if the targeted inbreeding rate was extremely low.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Maintaining discrete generations in recurrent phenotypic selection leads to increased genetic gain, especially at low heritabilities, by preventing selection error bias. With genomic truncation selection and genomic optimum contribution selection, genetic gain does not differ between discrete and overlapping generations assuming non-genetic effects are not present. Overlapping generations may increase genetic gain in the long term with very low targeted rates of inbreeding in genomic optimum contribution selection.</p></sec>', 'posted': '2021-10-14'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.10.10.463866', 'tweets': 3, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Developmental Biology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'STAG2 promotes the myelination transcriptional program in oligodendrocytes', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Ningyan Cheng'}, {'name': 'Mohammed Kanchwala'}, {'name': 'Bret M.

Thus, this study was conducted to determine the pharmacological mechanisms underlying its anti-breast cancer property using various network pathway analyses. Bioactive compounds from Coix lacryma-jobi and its potential target genes were obtained from SymMap. Breast cancer-related target genes were collected from CTD. Protein-protein interaction network was analyzed using the STRING database. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed using DAVID to further explore the mechanisms of Coix lacryma-jobi in treating breast cancer. PPI and compound-target-pathway were visualized using Cytoscape. A total of 26 bioactive compounds, 201 corresponding targets, 36625 breast cancer-associated targets were obtained, and 200 common targets were considered potential therapeutic targets. The 9 bioactive compounds identified were berberine, oleic acid, beta-sitosterol, sitosterol, linoleic acid, berberrubine, jatrorrhizine, thalifendine, and stigmasterol. The identified 5 core targets were ESR1, JUN, MAPK14, and RXRA.  Coix lacryma-jobi targets enriched in GO terms were mostly involved in regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, drug response, steroid hormone receptor activity, and protein binding. This study elucidates on the pharmacological underpinnings on the potency of adlay against breast cancer.

MhAgo can utilize all four types of guides (5’OH-gDNA, 5’P-gDNA, 5’OH-gRNA, and 5’P-gRNA) for ssDNA and RNA cleavage. Further studies demonstrated that MhAgo had high activities with 16-21 nt guides and no obvious preferences for the 5’-end nucleotides of 5’OH-guides. Unexpectedly, MhAgo had different preferences for the 5’-end nucleotides of 5’P-guides depending on the types of targets. Although the specificity of MhAgo was related to the types of guides, single mismatches in the central and 3’-supplementary regions of guides greatly reduced the cleavage efficiency. Additionally, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated MhAgo had the weakest affinity for 5’P-gRNA:tRNA duplex, which was consistent with its cleavage efficiency. In conclusion, MhAgo is highly active under a wide range of conditions and can be used for programmable endonucleolytic cleavage of both ssDNA and RNA substrates.

Here we use phototriggered charge injection from a site-specifically attached ruthenium photosensitizer to directly demonstrate the effects of charge redistribution within a protein. We find that binding of an antibody to phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is increased two folds under illumination. Remarkably, illumination is found to suppress the enzymatic activity of PGK by a factor as large as three. These responses are sensitive to the photosensitizer position on the protein. Surprisingly, left (but not right) circularly polarized light elicits these responses, indicating that the electrons involved in the observed dynamics are spin polarized, due to spin filtration by protein chiral structures. Our results directly establish the contribution of electrical polarization and the importance of the spin-dependent charge reorganization in the function of proteins.

In this study, we investigated the impact of pancreatic cancer ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) derived EVs on recipient non-tumorigenic pancreatic normal epithelial cells upon internalization. We show that PDAC cEVs increase the proliferation and invasive capability of treated normal cells. We further demonstrate that cEVs induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in treated normal pancreatic epithelial cells within 24 hours. Subsequently, these cells release several inflammatory cytokines. Leveraging a layered multi-omics approach, we analyzed EV cargo from a panel of 6 PDAC and 2 normal pancreas cell lines, using multiple EV isolation methods. We found that cEVs were enriched for an array of biomolecules which can induce or regulate ER stress and the UPR, including palmitic acid, sphingomyelins, metabolic regulators of tRNA charging and proteins which regulate trafficking and degradation. We further show that palmitic acid, at doses relevant to those found in cEVs, is sufficient to induce ER stress in normal pancreas cells. These results suggest that cEV cargo packaging may be designed to disseminate proliferative and invasive characteristics upon internalization by distant recipient normal cells, hitherto unreported. This study is among the first to highlight a major role for PDAC cEVs to induce stress in treated normal pancreas cells that may modulate a systemic response leading to altered phenotypes. For the first time, our study implicates cEV transported palmitic acid as a potential driver in this process. These findings highlight the importance of EVs in mediating disease etiology and open potential areas of investigation toward understanding the role of cEV lipids in promoting cell transformation in the surrounding microenvironment.</p>', 'posted': '2021-10-14'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.10.14.464379', 'tweets': 3, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Biochemistry', 'covid': False, 'title': 'The β-amylase7 gene in Zea mays encodes a protein with structural and catalytic properties similar to Arabidopsis BAM2', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Claire M Ravenburg'}, {'name': 'McKayla B Riney'}, {'name': 'Jonathan D Monroe'}, {'name': 'Christopher E Berndsen'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>Starch accumulates in the plastids of green plant tissue during the day to provide carbon for metabolism at night. Starch hydrolysis is catalyzed by members of the β-amylase (BAM) family, which in Arabidopsis thaliana (At), includes nine structurally and functionally diverse members. One of these enzymes, AtBAM2, is a plastid-localized enzyme that is unique among characterized β-amylases since it is tetrameric and exhibits sigmoidal kinetics. Sequence alignments show that the BAM domains of AtBAM7, a catalytically inactive, nuclear-localized transcription factor with an N-terminal DNA binding domain, and AtBAM2 are more closely related to each other than they are to any other AtBAM. Since BAM2 is found in more ancient lineages, it was hypothesized that BAM7 evolved from BAM2. However, analysis of the genomes of 48 flowering plants revealed 12 species that appear to have a BAM7 gene but lack a BAM2 gene. Upon closer inspection, these BAM7 proteins have a greater percent identity to AtBAM2 than to AtBAM7, and they share all of the AtBAM2 functional residues that BAM7 proteins normally lack. We hypothesize that these genes may encode a BAM2-like protein although they are currently annotated as BAM7-like genes. To test this hypothesis, we designed a cDNA of the short form of corn BAM7 (ZmBAM7-S) for expression in E. coli. Small Angle X-Ray Scattering data indicate that ZmBAM7-S has a tetrameric solution structure more similar to that of AtBAM2 than AtBAM1. In addition, partially purified ZmBAM7-S is catalytically active and exhibits sigmoidal kinetics. Together these data suggest that some BAM7 genes may encode a functional BAM2.

PERK13 protein is considered to play a significant role in helping plants tackle salinity levels in water. Methods: In this study, protein modelling tools and servers are used to model the 3D structure and the same is validated using Protein structure validation tools. Automated drug docking servers were used to dock the modelled protein with the chemical compound to analyse the electrostatic (H bond) interaction between PERK13 and De O Acetylated Curcumin Di Galactose, a better water soluble compound than curcumin. The docked structure was visualized using an advanced molecular visualization tool. Results and Discussion: The overall results obtained from this study on De O Acetylated Curcumin Di Galactose and PERK13 protein shows that De O Acetylated Curcumin Di Galactose, directly binds with the active site and other potentially binding regions of PERK13. Hence, it is concluded that De O Acetylated Curcumin Di Galactose could potentially play a vital role in future research related to the problem of helping the plants tackle increased saline levels in water.
