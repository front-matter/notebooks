Low-salt swelling of isolated chromatin fibers or nuclei has been used for decades to investigate the structural properties of chromatin. But, visible changes in chromatin appearance have not been linked to known building blocks of genome structure or features along the genome sequence. We combine low-salt swelling of isolated nuclei with genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and imaging approaches to probe the effects of chromatin extension genome-wide. Photoconverted patterns on nuclei during expansion and contraction indicate that global genome structure is preserved after dramatic nuclear volume swelling, suggesting a highly elastic chromosome topology. Hi-C experiments before, during, and after nuclear swelling show changes in average contact probabilities at short length scales, reflecting the extension of the local chromatin fiber. But, surprisingly, during this large increase in nuclear volume, there is a striking maintenance of loops, TADs, active and inactive compartments, and chromosome territories. Subtle differences after expansion are observed, suggesting that the local chromatin state, protein interactions, and location in the nucleus can affect how strongly a given structure is maintained under stress. From these observations, we propose that genome topology is robust to extension of the chromatin fiber and isotropic shape change, and that this elasticity may be beneficial in physiological circumstances of changes in nuclear size and volume.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-23'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.25.457692', 'tweets': 24, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Immunology', 'covid': True, 'title': 'The Lambda variant of SARS-CoV-2 has a better chance than the Delta variant to escape vaccines', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Haolin Liu'}, {'name': 'Pengcheng Wei'}, {'name': 'Qianqian Zhang'}, {'name': 'Katja Aviszus'}, {'name': 'Jared Linderberger'}, {'name': 'John Yang'}, {'name': 'Junfeng Liu'}, {'name': 'Zhongzhou Chen'}, {'name': 'Hassan Waheed'}, {'name': 'Lyndon Reynoso'}, {'name': 'Gregory P.

One fundamental question is how distinct WNT target genes are activated in a context-specific manner, given the dogma that most, if not all, WNT/ß-catenin responsive transcription is mediated by TCF/LEF transcription factors (TFs) that have similar DNA-binding specificities. Here we show that the SOX family of TFs direct lineage-specific WNT/ß-catenin responsive transcription during the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into definitive endoderm (DE) and neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs). Using time-resolved multi-omics analyses, we show that ß-catenin association with chromatin is highly dynamic, colocalizing with distinct TCFs and/or SOX TFs at distinct stages of differentiation, indicating both cooperative and competitive modes of genomic interactions. We demonstrate that SOX17 and SOX2 are required to recruit ß-catenin to hundreds of lineage-specific WNT-responsive enhancers, many of which are not occupied by TCFs. At a subset of these TCF-independent enhancers, SOX TFs are required to both establish a permissive chromatin landscape and recruit a WNT-enhanceosome complex that includes ß-catenin, BCL9, PYGO and transcriptional coactivators to direct SOX/ß-catenin-dependent transcription. Given that SOX TFs are expressed in almost every cell type, these results have broad mechanistic implications for the specificity of WNT responses across many developmental and disease contexts.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-26'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.24.457563', 'tweets': 9, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Evolutionary Biology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'The Evolution of Nest Site Specialization and its Macroevolutionary Consequences in Passerine Birds', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Rosana Zenil-Ferguson'}, {'name': 'Jay P.

However, in recent years, advances in comparative methods investigating trait-based differences associated with diversification have enabled more robust tests of this idea and have found mixed support. Here we test the evolutionary dead end hypothesis by estimating net diversification rate differences associated with nest site specialization among 3,224 species of passerine birds. In particular, we test whether the adoption of hole-nesting, a nest site specialization that decreases predation, results in reduced diversification rates relative to nesting outside of holes. Further, we examine whether evolutionary transitions to the specialist hole-nesting state have been more frequent than transitions out of hole-nesting. Using diversification models that accounted for background rate heterogeneity and different extinction rate scenarios, we found that hole-nesting specialization was not associated with diversification rate differences. Furthermore, contrary to the assumption that specialists rarely evolve into generalists, we found that transitions out of hole-nesting occur more frequently than transitions into hole-nesting. These results suggest that interspecific competition may limit adoption of hole-nesting, but that such competition does not result in limited diversification of hole-nesters. In conjunction with other recent studies using robust comparative methods, our results add to growing evidence that evolutionary dead ends are not a typical outcome of resource specialization.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-25'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.20.21261814', 'tweets': 9, 'archive': 'medRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Genetic and Genomic Medicine', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Comprehensive genetic analysis of the human lipidome identifies novel loci controlling lipid homeostasis with links to coronary artery disease', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Gemma Cadby'}, {'name': 'Corey Giles'}, {'name': 'Phillip E Melton'}, {'name': 'Kevin Huynh'}, {'name': 'Natalie A Mellett'}, {'name': 'Thy Duong'}, {'name': 'Anh Nguyen'}, {'name': 'Michelle Cinel'}, {'name': 'Alex Smith'}, {'name': 'Gavriel Olshansky'}, {'name': 'Tingting Wang'}, {'name': 'Marta Brozynska'}, {'name': 'Mike Inouye'}, {'name': 'Nina S McCarthy'}, {'name': 'Amir Ariff'}, {'name': 'Joseph Hung'}, {'name': 'Jennie Hui'}, {'name': 'John Beilby'}, {'name': 'Marie-Pierre Dubé'}, {'name': 'Gerald F Watts'}, {'name': 'Sonia Shah'}, {'name': 'Naomi R Wray'}, {'name': 'Wei Ling Florence Lim'}, {'name': 'Pratishtha Chatterjee'}, {'name': 'Ian Martins'}, {'name': 'Simon M Laws'}, {'name': 'Tenielle Porter'}, {'name': 'Michael Vacher'}, {'name': 'Ashley I Bush'}, {'name': 'Christopher C Rowe'}, {'name': 'Victor L Villemagne'}, {'name': 'David Ames'}, {'name': 'Colin L Masters'}, {'name': 'Kevin Taddei'}, {'name': 'Matthias Arnold'}, {'name': 'Gabi Kastenmüller'}, {'name': 'Kwangsik Nho'}, {'name': 'Andrew J Saykin'}, {'name': 'Xianlin Han'}, {'name': 'Rima Kaddurah-Daouk'}, {'name': 'Ralph N Martins'}, {'name': 'John Blangero'}, {'name': 'Peter J Meikle'}, {'name': 'Eric K Moses'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>We integrated lipidomics and genomics to unravel the genetic architecture of lipid metabolism and identify genetic variants associated with lipid species that are putatively in the mechanistic pathway to coronary artery disease (CAD).

In addition to selective loss of tissue-resident decidual macrophages, we report attenuation of antigen presentation and type I IFN signaling but upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in blood monocyte derived decidual macrophages.

Interestingly, frequencies of cytotoxic CD4 and CD8 T cells increased only in the blood, while CD8 effector memory T cells were expanded in the decidua. In contrast to decidual macrophages, signatures of type I IFN signaling were increased in decidual T cells. Finally, T cell receptor diversity was significantly reduced with infection in both compartments, albeit to a much greater extent in the blood.

Informed by these experimental results, we developed a model that describes substrate stiffness dependent dynamics of the polar PilA concentration which are quantitatively consistent with the transcriptional response to stiffness. Manipulating the ATPase activity of the TFP motors changes the TFP extension and retraction velocities and consequently the PilA concentration dynamics in a manner that is predictive of the experimental stiffness response. This work points to the use of a competition between PilA diffusion and TFP extension-retraction as a molecular shear rheometer. Our results highlight that stiffness sensing is a conserved property between the kingdoms of life.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-26'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.24.457481', 'tweets': 4, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Molecular Biology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'A yeast model of the ALS protein Matrin3 uncovers Hsp90 and its co-chaperone Sti1 as modifiers of misfolding and toxicity', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Sonja E.

However, demographic parameters and biogeographic distributions do not preserve directly in the archaeological record. Rather than attempting to estimate human abundance at some specific time in the past, a principled approach to making inferences at this scale is to ask what the human demography and biogeography of a hypothetical planet Earth would look like if populated by ethnographic hunter-gatherer societies. Given ethnographic hunter-gatherer societies likely include the largest, densest, and most complex foraging societies to have existed, we suggest population inferences drawn from this sample provide an upper bound to demographic estimates in prehistory. Our goal in this paper is to produce principled estimates of hunter-gatherer abundance, diversity, and biogeography. To do this we trained an extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost) to learn ethnographic hunter-gatherer population densities from a large matrix of climatic, environmental, and geographic data. We used the predictions generated by this model to reconstruct the hunter-gatherer biogeography of the rest of the planet. We find the human abundance of this world to be 6.1±2 million with an ethnolinguistic diversity of 8,330±2,770 populations, most of whom would have lived near coasts and in the tropics.</p><sec><title>Significance Statement</title><p>Understanding the abundance of humans on planet Earth prior to the development of agriculture and the industrialized world is essential to understanding human population growth. However, the problem is that these features of human populations in the past are unknown and so must be estimated from data. We developed a machine learning approach that uses ethnographic and environmental data to reconstruct the demography and biogeography of planet Earth if populated by hunter-gatherers. Such a world would house about 6 million people divided into about 8,330 populations with a particular concentration in the tropics and along coasts.</p></sec>', 'posted': '2021-08-24'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.22.457271', 'tweets': 3, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Pharmacology and Toxicology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Vapor cannabis exposure generationally affects male reproductive functions in mice', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Mingxin Shi'}, {'name': 'Esther M.

Subsequently, F0 males were bred with drug naïve CD-1 females to generate F1 males, and F1 offspring were used to generate F2 males. Cannabis vapor exposure decreased sperm count and/or motility in F0 and F1 males and disrupted the progression of germ cell development, as morphometric analyses exhibited an abnormal distribution of the stages of spermatogenesis in F0 males. Although plasma levels of testosterone were not affected by cannabis exposure in any ages or generations of males, dysregulated steroidogenic enzymes, <italic>Cyp11a1</italic> and <italic>Cyp19a1</italic>, were observed in F0 testis. In the neonatal testis from F1 males, while apoptosis was not altered, DNA damage and DNMT1, but not DNMT3A and DNMT3B, were increased in germ cells following cannabis exposure. In contrast, the alterations of DNA damage and DNMT1 expression were not observed in F2 neonatal males. These results suggest that cannabis vapor exposure generationally affects male reproductive functions, probably due to disruption of spermatogenesis in the developing testis.</p><sec><title>GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT</title><fig id=\"ufig1\" position=\"float\" orientation=\"portrait\" fig-type=\"figure\"><graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"457271v1_ufig1\" position=\"float\" orientation=\"portrait\" /></fig></sec><sec><title>HIGHLIGHTS</title><list list-type=\"bullet\"><list-item><p>Cannabis vapor exposure to adult males impairs sperm counts, motility and spermatogenesis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cannabis vapor exposure to F0 males causes reduced sperm counts in F1, but not in F2 males.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Plasma testosterone levels are not affected in F0, F1 and F2 males by cannabis exposure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cannabis increases DNA damage and the expression of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 in the F1 neonatal testis.</p></list-item></list></sec>', 'posted': '2021-08-24'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.23.457415', 'tweets': 3, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Scientific Communication and Education', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Time Evolution of the Stroke Symptom-Herb Networks Based on TCM Prescriptions', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Xing Fu'}, {'name': 'Qianqian Li'}, {'name': 'Feng Yang'}, {'name': 'Ranran Zhou'}, {'name': 'Ran Li'}, {'name': 'Jianchen Hou'}, {'name': 'Xiaohua Tao'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has its origins in distant antiquity and has piled up over a long time with much knowledge about diseases, especially stroke. Different combinations of symptom variables yield different combinations of herbs to form a myriad of prescriptions, and they have undergone repeated confirmation and are worthy objects of excavation and analysis. Herbal studies on stroke have developed from genomics to transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, yet more thought is needed on putting time in a wider perspective of the symptoms and herbs for stroke in Chinese medicine.</p><p>Due to this, we studied the dynamic structure of TCM prescriptions on stroke, using over 270 TCM prescription books containing 2231 prescriptions related to stroke recorded from 341 to 2000 CE.

The Stroke Symptom-Herb Networks (SSHNs) can be seen from its network characteristics that it is not a random network and has small-world characteristics. It has experienced two peaks in its nearly 1700-year history, during the Song dynasty, the Ming and Qing dynasties. From 600 years onwards, the core herb cluster has been initially formed.

Because abnormalities in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling have been observed in several AD models, we investigated TREM2 regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling via genetic deletion in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iPSC- microglia). We found that iPSC-microglia lacking TREM2 (TREM2 KO) show exaggerated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in response to purinergic agonists such as ADP that shape microglial injury responses. This ADP hypersensitivity, driven by increased expression of P2Y12 and P2Y13 receptors, results in sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and alters cell motility and process extension in TREM2 KO microglia. In a “Ca<sup>2+</sup> clamp” assay using iPSC-microglia expressing the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe, Salsa6f, we found that cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> tunes motility to a greater extent in TREM2 KO microglia. Despite showing greater overall displacement, TREM2 KO microglia exhibit reduced directional chemotaxis along ADP gradients. Accordingly, the chemotactic defect in TREM2 KO microglia was rescued by reducing cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> using a P2Y12 receptor antagonist. Our results show that loss of TREM2 confers a defect in microglial Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to purinergic signals, suggesting a window of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling for optimal microglial motility.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-24'}]\n"
