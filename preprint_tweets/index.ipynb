The majority of T6SSs deliver toxic effector proteins into competitor bacteria. Yet, the structure, function, and activation of many of these effectors remains poorly understood. Here, we present the structures of the T6SS effector RhsA from <italic>Pseudomonas protegens</italic> and its cognate T6SS spike protein, VgrG1, at 3.3 Å resolution. The structures reveal that the <underline>r</underline>earrangement <underline>h</underline>ot<underline>s</underline>pot (Rhs) repeats of RhsA assemble into a closed anticlockwise β-barrel spiral similar to that found in bacterial insecticidal Tc toxins and in metazoan teneurin proteins. We find that the C-terminal toxin domain of RhsA is autoproteolytically cleaved but remains inside the Rhs ‘cocoon’ where, with the exception of three ordered structural elements, most of the toxin is disordered. The N-terminal ‘plug’ domain is unique to T6SS Rhs proteins and resembles a champagne cork that seals the Rhs cocoon at one end while also mediating interactions with VgrG1. Interestingly, this domain is also autoproteolytically cleaved inside the cocoon but remains associated with it. We propose that mechanical force is required to remove the cleaved part of the plug, resulting in the release of the toxin domain as it is delivered into a susceptible bacterial cell by the T6SS.</p>', 'posted': '2021-09-14'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.09.13.460111', 'tweets': 37, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Microbiology', 'covid': True, 'title': 'Therapeutic efficacy of an oral nucleoside analog of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in mice.', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Alexandra Schafer'}, {'name': 'David R Martinez'}, {'name': 'John J Won'}, {'name': 'Fernanado R Moreira'}, {'name': 'Ariane J Brown'}, {'name': 'Kendra L Gully'}, {'name': 'Rao Kalla'}, {'name': 'Kwon Chun'}, {'name': 'Venice Du Pont'}, {'name': 'Darius Babusis'}, {'name': 'Jennifer Tang'}, {'name': 'Eisuke Murakami'}, {'name': 'Raju Subramanian'}, {'name': 'Kimberly T Barrett'}, {'name': 'Blake J.

In the setting of waning immunity from infection and vaccination, breakthrough infections are becoming increasingly common and treatment options remain limited. Additionally, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with their potential to escape therapeutic monoclonal antibodies emphasizes the need to develop second-generation oral antivirals targeting highly conserved viral proteins that can be rapidly deployed to outpatients. Here, we demonstrate the in vitro antiviral activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of GS-621763, an orally bioavailable prodrug of GS-441524, the parental nucleoside of remdesivir, which targets the highly conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. GS-621763 exhibited significant antiviral activity in lung cell lines and two different human primary lung cell culture systems. The dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile observed after oral administration of GS-621763 translated to dose-dependent antiviral activity in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic GS-621763 significantly reduced viral load, lung pathology, and improved pulmonary function in COVID-19 mouse model. A direct comparison of GS-621763 with molnupiravir, an oral nucleoside analog antiviral currently in human clinical trial, proved both drugs to be similarly efficacious. These data demonstrate that therapy with oral prodrugs of remdesivir can significantly improve outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice. Thus, GS-621763 supports the exploration of GS-441524 oral prodrugs for the treatment of COVID-19 in humans.</p>', 'posted': '2021-09-13'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.09.09.21263331', 'tweets': 34, 'archive': 'medRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Epidemiology', 'covid': True, 'title': 'Second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Delhi, India: high seroprevalence not a deterrent?', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Nandini Sharma'}, {'name': 'Pragya Sharma'}, {'name': 'Saurav Basu'}, {'name': 'Ritika Bakshi'}, {'name': 'Ekta Gupta'}, {'name': 'Reshu Agarwal'}, {'name': 'Kumar Dushyant'}, {'name': 'Nutan Mundeja'}, {'name': 'Zeasley Marak'}, {'name': 'Sanjay Singh'}, {'name': 'Gautam Kumar Singh'}, {'name': 'Ruchir Rustagi'}, {'name': 'S K Sarin'}]\", 'abstract': '<sec><title>Background</title><p>We report the findings of a large follow-up community-based serosurvey and correlating it with the COVID-19 test-positivity rate and the case load observed during the peak of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Delhi, India.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Individuals of age ≥5 years were recruited from 274 wards of the state (population ∼ 19.6 million) during January 11 to January 22’ 2021.

The classic paradigm of disease is one active state of symptomatic presentation with bacteriologically positive sputum, now referred to as clinical disease. Within the spectrum, a subclinical phase (where people do not report symptoms but have bacteriologically positive sputum) has been widely accepted, due to prevalence surveys using chest radiography screening in addition to symptom screening. On average these prevalence surveys have found around 50% of people with prevalent infectious TB had subclinical disease. There is also another state of minimal disease, or non-infectious disease, that is the earliest point on the disease spectrum after progression from infection. The likelihood or speed of natural progression, regression, or persistence of individuals across this spectrum remains unknown. As a consequence, the ability to accurately predict the impact of interventions has been limited. As individuals with bacteriologically-positive TB now receive treatment, contemporary data to inform the required transitions is highly limited.

We considered a cohort of people with prevalent bacteriologically positive disease, with a 50/50 split of people with subclinical and clinical disease at baseline. We found that within five years, 13.3% of people recover from TB, with no chance of progressing to active disease without reinfection. However, we also find that 26.3% are still spending time infectious at the end of the five years. Our estimates for 10 year mortality and duration of symptoms before treatment aligned with the known and accepted values.</p><p>We also show that regression from subclinical disease results in a large reservoir of people with minimal disease, from which they can permanently recover, but can also progress again to subclinical disease. The undulating pathways that lead to regression and progression mean that 30% (27.2%-32.6%) of individuals with prevalent subclinical disease do not experience symptoms over the course of five years. This shows that clinical disease is neither a rapid, nor inevitable outcome of subclinical disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications of the available evidence</title><p>With these data-driven estimates of parameters, informed projections of the relative value of addressing minimal, subclinical, or clinical disease can now be provided.

We explored these questions in an individual (EG) born without the left superior temporal lobe but exhibiting normal reading ability. Using fMRI, we recorded brain activation to visual words, objects, faces, and scrambled words in EG and neurotypical controls. We did not observe word selectivity either in EG’s right homotope of the VWFA (rVWFA)—the most expected location given that EG’s language network is right-lateralized—or in her spared left VWFA (lVWFA), in the presence of typical face selectivity in both the right and left fusiform face area (rFFA, lFFA).

Thus, there is a need to assess the generalizability of theories and findings from lab-based motor learning studies on much larger samples across longer time scales. In addition, laboratory-based studies of motor learning use relatively simple motor tasks which participants are unlikely to be intrinsically motivated to learn, limiting the interpretation of their findings in more ecologically valid settings. We studied the acquisition and longitudinal refinement of a complex sensorimotor skill embodied in a first-person shooter video game scenario, with a large sample size (N = 7174 participants, 682,564 repeats of the 60 sec game) over a period of months. Participants voluntarily practiced the gaming scenario for as much as several hours per day up to 100 days. We found improvement in performance accuracy (quantified as hit rate) was modest over time but motor acuity (quantified as hits per second) improved considerably, with 40-60% retention from one day to the next. We observed steady improvements in motor acuity across multiple days of video game practice, unlike most motor learning tasks studied in the lab that hit a performance ceiling rather quickly. Learning rate was a nonlinear function of baseline performance level, amount of daily practice, and to a lesser extent, number of days between practice sessions. In addition, we found that the benefit of additional practice on any given day was non-monotonic; the greatest improvements in motor acuity were evident with about an hour of practice and 90% of the learning benefit was achieved by practicing 30 minutes per day. Taken together, these results provide a proof-of-concept in studying motor skill acquisition outside the confines of the traditional laboratory and provide new insights into how a complex motor skill is acquired in an ecologically valid setting and refined across much longer time scales than typically explored.</p>', 'posted': '2021-09-17'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.09.14.460331', 'tweets': 16, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Immunology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Defective endosome-TGN retrograde transport promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Zhirong Zhang'}, {'name': 'Li Ran'}, {'name': 'Rossella Venditti'}, {'name': 'Zengzhen Liu'}, {'name': 'Annette Schürmann'}, {'name': 'Juan S.

We show that the mutations responsible for increasing the specificity of Cas9 alter the allosteric structure of the catalytic HNH domain, impacting the signal transmission from the DNA recognition region to the catalytic sites for cleavage.

This differential perturbation of the allosteric signaling reflects the different capabilities of the single mutants to increase Cas9 specificity, with the mutation achieving the highest specificity also strongly perturbing the signaling transfer. These outcomes reveal that the allosteric regulation is critical for the specificity enhancement of the Cas9 enzyme, and are valuable to harness the signaling network to improve the system’s specificity.</p>', 'posted': '2021-09-14'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.09.13.460076', 'tweets': 12, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Microbiology', 'covid': True, 'title': 'Elicitation of potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses through immunization using a versatile adenovirus-inspired multimerization platform', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'C Chevillard'}, {'name': 'A Amen'}, {'name': 'S Besson'}, {'name': 'D Hannani'}, {'name': 'I Bally'}, {'name': 'V Dettling'}, {'name': 'E Gout'}, {'name': 'CJ Moreau'}, {'name': 'M Buisson'}, {'name': 'S Gallet'}, {'name': 'D Fenel'}, {'name': 'E Vassal-Stermann'}, {'name': 'G Schoehn'}, {'name': 'P Poignard'}, {'name': 'MC Dagher'}, {'name': 'P Fender'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has shown that vaccine preparedness is critical to anticipate a fast response to emergent pathogens with high infectivity.

We investigated these questions by recording place cells from the CA1 while the rats ran in an environment with the conflicting association between reward flavors and distal cues. We report that the hippocampal place cells coherently and dynamically bind to reward flavors or distal cues across sessions, but not simultaneously suggesting the use of a single spatial map.

This contrasts with the preceding epidemics of the closely related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both of which evolved adaptively. It is possible that the SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a unique or adaptive feature which deviates from other coronaviruses. Alternatively, the virus may have been cryptically circulating in humans for a sufficient time to have acquired adaptive changes for efficient transmission before the onset of the current pandemic. In order to test the above scenarios, we analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 sequences from minks (<italic>Neovision vision</italic>) and parenteral human strains. In the early phase of the mink epidemic (April to May 2020), nonsynonymous to synonymous mutation ratios per site within the spike protein was 2.93, indicating a selection process favoring adaptive amino acid changes. In addition, mutations within this protein concentrated within its receptor binding domain and receptor binding motif. Positive selection also left a trace on linked neutral variation. An excess of high frequency derived variants produced by genetic hitchhiking was found during middle (June to July 2020) and early late (August to September 2020) phases of the mink epidemic, but quickly diminished in October and November 2020. Strong positive selection found in SARS-CoV-2 from minks implies that the virus may be not unique in super-adapting to a wide range of new hosts. The mink study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 already went through adaptive evolution in humans, and likely been circulating in humans at least six months before the first case found in Wuhan, China.

In recent work we identified mutations in Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Type H (<italic>Ptprh</italic>, also known as SAP-1) as being associated with elevated phosphorylation of EGFR in a mouse model of breast cancer. We have examined a series of tumors from this mouse model, revealing conserved V483M <italic>Ptprh</italic> mutations within the FVB background, but a series of varied mutations in other backgrounds.

Other roles for PTPRH were explored through a receptor tyrosine kinase array, noting elevated phosphorylation of FGFR1. Knockout of PTPRH in NSCLC cell lines resulted in elevated phosphorylated FGFR1 relative to controls, indicating that PTPRH has a number of targets that may be aberrantly activated in NSCLC with mutations in PTPRH.

In a cohort of 119 patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation, a treatment with a high risk for neutropenic fever, the fecal microbiome was examined at onset of neutropenia. Over the next 4 days, 63 patients (53%) developed a fever, which was associated with increased Akkermansia muciniphila, a species of intestinal commensal bacteria with mucus-degrading capabilities (p=0.006, corrected for multiple comparisons). In mouse models, two cytotoxic therapies, irradiation and melphalan, each also produced an expansion of fecal A. muciniphila as well as thinning of the colonic mucus layer. Direct irradiation of fecal bacteria, however, did not lead to expansion of A. muciniphila, suggesting an indirect effect via the host. Irradiated mice displayed reduced oral food intake, and dietary restriction of unirradiated mice was sufficient to produce an expansion of A. muciniphila and thinning of the colonic mucus layer. Treatment of diet-restricted mice with several narrow-spectrum antibiotics demonstrated that azithromycin, which depleted intestinal A. muciniphila, led to preservation of the colonic mucus layer. Diet-restricted mice developed an increase in colonic luminal pH and reductions in acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Treatment of A. muciniphila in vitro with lower pH and increased propionate led to delayed growth and prevented utilization of mucin. Dietary restriction and low propionate also produced large changes in A. muciniphila gene expression, including upregulation of L-fucose isomerase, a member of glycosyl hydrolase family 109, and a member of the Idh/MocA family of oxidoreductases, which may play roles in mucin glycan utilization. Supplementing the drinking water of diet-restricted mice with propionate led to preservation of the colonic mucus layer. In the setting of irradiation, we found that by 6 days following treatment mice developed signs of systemic infection manifesting as hypothermia. Upon examination of colon tissues, we found that irradiated mice had elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1b, CCL2, CCL7, IL-22, CXCL1, and CXCL10. Treatment with azithromycin or propionate lessened the severity of hypothermia, preserved the mucus layer, and mitigated elevations in inflammatory cytokines in the colon.

With the recent development of pan-genome information in many species, it is important that we understand the limitations of single genotype references for transcriptomics analysis.

We also propose a biochemical hypothesis for EcKL involvement in caffeine detoxification and highlight the many unknown aspects of caffeine metabolism in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and other insects.</p><sec><title>Highlights</title><list list-type=\"bullet\"><list-item><p>Phosphorylation is an under-characterised detoxification reaction in insects</p></list-item><list-item><p>Dro5 EcKL genes are good detoxification candidate genes in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic></p></list-item><list-item><p>Knockout and misexpression of some Dro5 genes modulated tolerance to caffeine</p></list-item><list-item><p>Dro5 genes may also confer tolerance to the fungal toxin kojic acid</p></list-item><list-item><p>Caffeine tolerance could be adaptive for <italic>Drosophila</italic> associating with <italic>Citrus</italic> fruits</p></list-item></list></sec>', 'posted': '2021-09-16'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.09.13.460073', 'tweets': 3, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Physiology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Addition of a carboxy terminal tail to the normally tailless gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor impairs fertility in female mice', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Chirine Toufaily'}, {'name': 'Jérôme Fortin'}, {'name': 'Carlos A.

GnRH stimulates follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) synthesis via a G protein-coupled receptor, GnRHR, in the pituitary gland. In mammals, GnRHR lacks a C-terminal cytosolic tail (Ctail) and does not exhibit homologous desensitization. This might be an evolutionary adaptation that enables LH surge generation and ovulation. To test this idea, we fused the chicken GnRHR Ctail to the endogenous murine GnRHR in a transgenic model. The LH surge was blunted, but not blocked in these mice. In contrast, they showed reductions in FSH production, ovarian follicle development, and fertility. Addition of the Ctail altered the nature of agonist-induced calcium signaling required for normal FSH production. The loss of the GnRHR Ctail during mammalian evolution is unlikely to have conferred a selective advantage by enabling the LH surge. The adaptive significance of this specialization remains to be determined.</p>', 'posted': '2021-09-16'}]\n"
