Comparative analyses can shed light on the diversity of mutagenesis across species and on long-standing hypotheses regarding the evolution of somatic mutation rates and their role in cancer and ageing. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing of 208 intestinal crypts from 56 individuals to study the landscape of somatic mutation across 16 mammalian species. We found somatic mutagenesis to be dominated by seemingly endogenous mutational processes in all species, including 5-methylcytosine deamination and oxidative damage. With some differences, mutational signatures in other species resembled those described in humans, although the relative contribution of each signature varied across species. Remarkably, the somatic mutation rate per year varied greatly across species and exhibited a strong inverse relationship with species lifespan, with no other life-history trait studied displaying a comparable association. Despite widely different life histories among the species surveyed, including ~30-fold variation in lifespan and ~40,000-fold variation in body mass, the somatic mutation burden at the end of lifespan varied only by a factor of ~3. These data unveil common mutational processes across mammals and suggest that somatic mutation rates are evolutionarily constrained and may be a determinant of lifespan.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-19'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.16.21261912', 'tweets': 190, 'archive': 'medRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Infectious Diseases (except HIV/AIDS)', 'covid': True, 'title': 'Genomic profiles of Covishield and Covaxin breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 strains from Odisha, India', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Arup Ghosh'}, {'name': 'Safal Walia'}, {'name': 'Roma Rattan'}, {'name': 'Amol Kanampalliwar'}, {'name': 'Atimukta Jha'}, {'name': 'Shifu Aggarwal'}, {'name': 'Sana Fatma'}, {'name': 'Niyati Das'}, {'name': 'Nirupama Chayani'}, {'name': 'Punit Prasad'}, {'name': 'Sunil K.

With NH residents’ poor initial vaccine response, the rise of NH breakthrough infections and outbreaks, characterization of the durability of immunity to inform public health policy on the need for boosting is needed. We report on humoral immunity from 2 weeks to 6-months post-vaccination in 120 NH residents and 92 ambulatory healthcare worker controls with and without pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, and serum neutralization titers, were assessed using a bead-based ELISA method and pseudovirus neutralization assay. Anti-spike, anti-RBD and neutralization levels dropped more than 80% over 6 months’ time in all groups irrespective of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. At 6 months post-vaccine, 72% of the infection-naive NH residents had neutralization titers at or below the lower limit of detection compared to 16% at 2 weeks after full vaccination. These data demonstrate a significant reduction in levels of antibody in all groups. In particular, those infection-naive NH residents had lower initial post-vaccination humoral immunity immediately and exhibited the greatest declines 6 months later. Healthcare workers, given their younger age and relative good-health, achieved higher initial antibody levels and better maintained them, yet also experienced significant declines in humoral immunity. Based on the rapid spread of the delta variant and reports of vaccine breakthrough in NH and among younger community populations, boosting NH residents may be warranted.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-18'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.16.456551', 'tweets': 59, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Molecular Biology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Tuning levels of low-complexity domain interactions to modulate endogenous oncogenic transcription', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Shasha Chong'}, {'name': 'Thomas G.W.

Here, we investigated how tuning the amount and localization of LCD-LCD interactions <italic>in vivo</italic> affects transcription of endogenous human genes. Quantitative single-cell and single-molecule imaging reveals that the oncogenic TF EWS/FLI1 requires a finely tuned range of LCD-LCD interactions to efficiently activate target genes. Modest or more dramatic increases in LCD-LCD interactions toward putative LLPS repress EWS/FLI1-driven transcription in patient cells. Likewise, ectopically creating LCD-LCD interactions to sequester EWS/FLI1 into a bona fide LLPS compartment, the nucleolus, inhibits EWS/FLI1-driven transcription and oncogenic transformation. Our findings reveal fundamental principles underlying LCD-mediated transcription and suggest mislocalizing specific LCD-LCD interactions as a novel therapeutic strategy for targeting disease-causing TFs.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-17'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.20.457082', 'tweets': 44, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Microbiology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'A nitrite-oxidizing bacterium constitutively consumes atmospheric hydrogen', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Pok Man Leung'}, {'name': 'Anne Daebeler'}, {'name': 'Eleonora Chiri'}, {'name': 'Paul R.

Nitrospira are thought to be well-adapted to substrate limitation owing to their high affinity for nitrite and capacity to use alternative energy sources. Here, we demonstrate that the canonical nitrite oxidizer Nitrospira moscoviensis oxidizes hydrogen (H2) below atmospheric levels using a high-affinity group 2a nickel-iron hydrogenase [Km(app) = 32 nM]. Atmospheric H2 oxidation occurred under both nitrite-replete and nitrite-deplete conditions, suggesting low-potential electrons derived from H2 oxidation promote nitrite-dependent growth and enable survival during nitrite limitation. Proteomic analyses confirmed the hydrogenase was abundant under both conditions and indicated extensive metabolic changes occur to reduce energy expenditure and growth under nitrite-deplete conditions. Respirometry analysis indicates the hydrogenase and nitrite oxidoreductase are bona fide components of the aerobic respiratory chain of N. moscoviensis, though they transfer electrons to distinct electron carriers in accord with the contrasting redox potentials of their substrates. Collectively, this study suggests atmospheric H2 oxidation enhances the growth and survival of NOB in amid variability of nitrite supply. These findings also extend the phenomenon of atmospheric H2 oxidation to a seventh phylum (Nitrospirota) and reveal unexpected new links between the global hydrogen and nitrogen cycles.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-20'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.20.457057', 'tweets': 42, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Bioinformatics', 'covid': False, 'title': 'MultiVI: deep generative model for the integration of multi-modal data', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Tal Ashuach'}, {'name': 'Mariano I Gabitto'}, {'name': 'Michael I Jordan'}, {'name': 'Nir Yosef'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>The ability to jointly profile the transcriptional and chromatin landscape of single-cells has emerged as a powerful technique to identify cellular populations and shed light on their regulation of gene expression.

MultiVI creates an informative low-dimensional latent space that accurately reflects both chromatin and transcriptional properties of the cells even when one of the modalities is missing. MultiVI accounts for technical effects in both scRNA and scATAC-seq while correcting for batch effects in both data modalities. We use public datasets to demonstrate that MultiVI is stable, easy to use, and outperforms current approaches for the joint analysis of paired and unpaired data.

We find that MAFFT and Refiner generally outperform other aligners for low to medium divergence simulated sequences, while Refiner is uniquely effective when tasked with aligning high-divergent and fragmented instances of a family.

SeqDistK computes the dissimilarity matrix for phylogenetic analysis, incorporating seven k-mer based dissimilarity measures, namely d2, d2S, d2star, Euclidean, Manhattan, CVTree, and Chebyshev. Based on these dissimilarities, SeqDistK constructs phylogenetic tree using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean algorithm. Using a golden standard dataset of 16S rRNA and its associated phylogenetic tree, we compared SeqDistK to Muscle – a multi sequence aligner. We found SeqDistK was not only 38 times faster than Muscle in computational efficiency but also more accurate. SeqDistK achieved the smallest symmetric difference between the inferred and ground truth trees with a range between 13 to 18, while that of Muscle was 62. When measures d2, d2star, d2S, Euclidean, and k-mer size k=5 were used, SeqDistK consistently inferred phylogenetic tree almost identical to the ground truth tree. We also performed clustering of 16S rRNA sequences using SeqDistK and found the clustering was highly consistent with known biological taxonomy. Among all the measures, d2S (k=5, M=2) showed the best accuracy as it correctly clustered and classified all sample sequences.

Depletion of RSC increased divergent noncoding transcription and decreased protein-coding transcription at promoters with strong directionality. Consistent with RSC’s role in regulating chromatin, RSC depletion impacts nucleosome occupancy upstream of the nucleosome depleted region where divergent transcription initiates, suggesting that nucleosome positioning at the 5’ border of gene promoters physically blocks the recruitment of the transcription machinery and inhibits initiation of divergent transcription. Highly directional promoters were also enriched for the binding of GRFs such as Reb1 and Abf1. Furthermore, ectopic targeting of divergent transcription initiation sites with GRFs or the dCas9 protein can suppress divergent transcription.

We collected information on patient demographics, co-morbidities, iNO treatment, need for intubation, arterial blood gas analysis, laboratory values, hospital length of stay, and mortality. Patients were divided into two groups based on the timing of iNO administration: group 1 - pre-intubation (i.e. iNO started at least 1 day prior to endotracheal intubation, if any) and group 2 - post-intubation (i.e. iNO started on the same day as or after endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation). \\n\\nResult: A total of 45 (group 1, n=26 [57.8%] vs group2, n=19 [42.2%]) COVID 19 patients who had iNO use.

A comprehensive computational characterization of SARS-CoV-2 S protein structures and dynamics provides insights into structural and thermal stability associated with a variety of S protein mutants. These findings allow us to make recommendations about the future mutant design of SARS-CoV-2 S protein variants that are optimized to elicit neutralizing antibodies, resist structural rearrangements that aid cellular fusion, and are thermally stabilized. The integrated computational approach can be applied to optimize vaccine immunogen design and predict escape of vaccine-induced antibody responses by SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p></sec>', 'posted': '2021-08-19'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.18.456644', 'tweets': 6, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Microbiology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Intracellular Salmonella Paratyphi A is motile and differs in the expression of flagella-chemotaxis, SPI-1 and carbon utilization pathways in comparison to Intracellular S.

In this work, we compared for the first time their intracellular trascriptomic architecture and cellular phenotypes during epithelial cell infection. While transcription induction of many metal transport systems, purines, biotin, PhoPQ and SPI-2 regulons was common in both intracellular SPA and STM, we identified 234 differentially expressed genes that showed distinct expression patterns in intracellular SPA vs. STM. Surprisingly, clear expression differences were found in SPI-1, motility and chemotaxis, and carbon (mainly citrate, galactonate and ethanolamine) utilization pathways, indicating that these pathways are regulated and possibly function differently, during their intracellular phase. Moreover, we show that the induction of flagella genes by intracellular SPA leads to cytosolic motility, a conserved trait specific to SPA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a flagellum-dependent intracellular motility of any Salmonella serovar in living host cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that the elevated expression of SPI-1 and motility genes by intracellular SPA results in increased invasiveness of SPA, following exit from host cells. We propose that such changes prime SPA towards new cycles of host cell infection and contribute to the ability of SPA to disseminate beyond the intestinal lamina propria of the human host, during enteric fever.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-18'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.20.457043', 'tweets': 6, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Molecular Biology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Constitutive signal bias mediated by the human GHRHR splice variant 1', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Zhaotong Cong'}, {'name': 'Fulai Zhou'}, {'name': 'Chao Zhang'}, {'name': 'Xinyu Zou'}, {'name': 'Huibing Zhang'}, {'name': 'Yuzhe Wang'}, {'name': 'Qingtong Zhou'}, {'name': 'Xiaoqing Cai'}, {'name': 'Qiaofeng Liu'}, {'name': 'Jie Li'}, {'name': 'Lijun Shao'}, {'name': 'Chunyou Mao'}, {'name': 'Xi Wang'}, {'name': 'Jihong Wu'}, {'name': 'Tian Xia'}, {'name': 'Lihua Zhao'}, {'name': 'Hualiang Jiang'}, {'name': 'Yan Zhang'}, {'name': 'H.

These signatures can quantify therapeutically-relevant as well as accidental radiation exposures. The prodromal symptoms of Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) overlap some viral infections. We recently showed that these radiation signatures produced unexpected false positive misclassification of influenza and dengue infected samples. The present study investigates these and other confounders, and then mitigates their effects on signature accuracy.\\nMethods: This study investigated recall by previous and novel radiation signatures independently derived from multiple Gene Expression Omnibus datasets on common and rare non-malignant blood disorders and blood-borne infections (thromboembolism, S. aureus bacteremia, malaria, sickle cell disease, polycythemia vera, and aplastic anemia). Normalized expression levels of signature genes are used as input to machine learning-based classifiers to predict radiation exposure in other hematological conditions. \\nResults: Except for aplastic anemia, these confounders modify the normal baseline expression values, leading to false-positive misclassification of radiation exposures in 8 to 54% of individuals. Shared changes were predominantly in DNA damage response and apoptosis-related gene transcripts in radiation and confounding hematological conditions compromise the utility of these signatures for radiation assessment. These confounding conditions are known to induce neutrophil extracellular traps, initiated by chromatin decondensation, fragmentation and often, programmed cell death. Ribovirus infections are proposed to deplete RNA binding proteins, inducing R-loops in chromatin which collide with replication forks resulting in DNA damage and apoptosis. To mitigate the effects of confounders, we evaluated predicted radiation positive samples with novel gene expression signatures derived from radiation-responsive transcripts of secreted blood plasma proteins whose expression levels are unperturbed in these confounding conditions. \\nConclusions: This approach identifies and eliminates misclassified samples with underlying hematological or infectious conditions, leaving only samples with true radiation exposures. Diagnostic accuracy is significantly improved by selecting genes that maximize both sensitivity and specificity in the appropriate tissue using combinations of the best signatures for each of these classes of signatures.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-19'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.18.456772', 'tweets': 4, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Animal Behavior and Cognition', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Multiple parasitism promotes facultative host acceptance of cuckoo eggs and rejection of cuckoo chicks', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Hee-Jin Noh'}, {'name': 'Ros Gloag'}, {'name': 'Naomi E.

This ‘clutch dilution effect’ has been proposed as a precondition for the evolution of cuckoo nestling eviction by hosts, but no previous studies have tested this in a host that rejects cuckoo nestlings.

Gerygones evict cuckoo nestlings but accept cuckoo eggs.

Yet gerygones were also flexible in their egg acceptance, with 35% abandoning cuckoo-egg-only clutches. This novel demonstration of adaptive clutch dilution suggests that multiple parasitism can favour a facultative response to brood parasite eggs, whereby hosts accept or reject parasite eggs depending on clutch composition.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-19'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.17.456507', 'tweets': 4, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Developmental Biology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'A micro-evolutionary change in target binding sites as key determinant of Ultrabithorax function in Drosophila', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Soumen Khan'}, {'name': 'Saurabh J.

On E14.5 and E16.5, we also examined the spatial expression of Gsk3β, an inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling to determine its potential role in radial patterning of the cochlea. Gsk3β was broadly expressed across the radial axis of the epithelium; therefore, unlikely to control WNT-mediated medial specification. In conclusion, the spatial expression of PORCN enriches WNT secretion from the medial domains of the cochlea to influence the specification of cell fates in the medial sensory domain.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-20'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.18.456889', 'tweets': 3, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Microbiology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Does plant diversity determine the diversity of the rhizosphere microbial community?', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Aleksei Zverev'}, {'name': 'Arina Kichko'}, {'name': 'Vasiliy Shapkin'}, {'name': 'Aleksandr Pinaev'}, {'name': 'Nikolay Provorov'}, {'name': 'Evgeny Andronov'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>The rhizosphere community represents an “ecological interface” between plant and soil, providing the plant with a number of advantages. Close connection and mutual influence in this communication allow to talk about the self-adjusting “plant-rhizosphere community” system, which should be be studied in connection. Diversity estimation is one of the ways of describing both bacterial and plant communities. Based on the literature, there are two assumptions of how the diversity of plant communities related to the diversity of bacterial communities: 1) an increase in the species richness of plants leads to an increase in the number of available micro-niches, and increasing of microbial diversity, 2) an increase in the species richness of plants is accompanied by the predominant development of bacteria from highly productive specific taxa and decreasing in the diversity of microorganisms. Experimental studies show controversial results.</p><p>We analyzed field sites (rye crop field and two fallow sites), using DNA isolation of both the plant root mass (followed by sequencing of the ITS1 region) and rhizosphere microorganisms (followed by sequencing of the 16s rDNA V4 region). This allowed us to 1) accurately determine the abundance and taxonomic position of plant communities; 2) extract information about both plant and microbial communities from the same sample.</p><p>There was no correlation between alpha-diversity indices of plants and rhizosphere communities. Alpha-diversity connection should be explored in similar plant communities, such as synusia. We hypothesize, that the significant differences in plant abundances lead to significant changes in exudation profiles, and the loss of diversity connection. The beta-diversity between rhizosphere communities and plant communities is highly correlated, in particular in terms of the abundance of taxa. This can be explained by a potential correlation (as reported in the literature) or by the presence of statistical artifacts.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-19'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.18.456900', 'tweets': 3, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Microbiology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'A bacterial genome and culture collection of gut microbial in weanling piglet', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Bo Dong'}, {'name': 'Xiaoqian Lin'}, {'name': 'Xiaohuan Jing'}, {'name': 'Tuanyuan Hu'}, {'name': 'Jianwei Zhou'}, {'name': 'Jianwei Chen'}, {'name': 'Liang Xiao'}, {'name': 'Bo Wang'}, {'name': 'Zhuang Chen'}, {'name': 'Jing Liu'}, {'name': 'Yiyin Hu'}, {'name': 'Guilin Liu'}, {'name': 'Shanshan Liu'}, {'name': 'Junnian Liu'}, {'name': 'Wenkang Wei'}, {'name': 'Yuanqiang Zou'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>The microbiota hosted in the pig gastrointestinal tract are important for productivity of livestock.

Here, we demonstrate that microglia are necessary for sensory experience-dependent synapse elimination in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the mouse, a process previously shown to be mediated by the microglia-derived cytokine TWEAK and its neuronal receptor Fn14. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing in mice lacking Fn14 or TWEAK at the height of experience-dependent refinement revealed that TWEAK-Fn14 signaling coordinates robust programs of gene expression in excitatory thalamocortical neurons of the dLGN. Gene targets of TWEAK and Fn14 are enriched for regulators of synapse and chromatin remodeling, suggesting that TWEAK-Fn14 signaling coordinates neuronal transcription to promote circuit refinement and epigenomic maturation in response to experience. We further find that Fn14 expression is not restricted to the dLGN but extends to other brain regions as well, both during development and in the adult. Consistent with the expression of Fn14 outside of the visual system, Fn14 knockout mice show significant impairments in multiple tests of memory task proficiency. At baseline, loss of Fn14 does not affect macroscopic neural activity measured by electroencephalogram recordings <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, mice lacking Fn14 displayed worse seizure outcomes and were less likely to survive when seizures were pharmacologically induced. Thus, TWEAK-Fn14 signaling coordinates neuronal transcription during development and contributes to cognitive function in the adult.

TEPS was tested on 31 records of three channel capacitive electrode data from the UnoViS automobile database. TEPS showed a sensitivity (SE) of 91.3% and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 3.0% compared to an SE and FDR of 75.3% and 65.0% respectively for a conventional single channel detector (OSEA) applied separately to the three channels.

In 6 of the 31 records, TEPS’ percentage was at least 30% greater than OSEA’s. TEPS was also applied to synthetic data comprising a known signal corrupted with calibrated amounts of noise. At a fixed SE of 85%, increasing the number of channels from one to two resulted in an improvement of approximately 5dB in noise resistance, while increasing the number of channels from two to four resulted in an improvement of approximately 3dB in noise resistance.
