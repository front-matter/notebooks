Evidence suggests that the virus is evolving to allow efficient spread through the human population, including vaccinated individuals. Here we report a study of viral variants from surveillance of the Delaware Valley, including the city of Philadelphia, and variants infecting vaccinated subjects. We sequenced and analyzed complete viral genomes from 2621 surveillance samples from March 2020 to September 2021 and compared them to genome sequences from 159 vaccine breakthroughs. In the early spring of 2020, all detected variants were of the B.1 and closely related lineages. A mixture of lineages followed, notably including B.1.243 followed by B.1.1.7 (alpha), with other lineages present at lower levels. Later isolations were dominated by B.1.617.2 (delta) and other delta lineages; delta was the exclusive variant present by the last time sampled. To investigate whether any variants appeared preferentially in vaccine breakthroughs, we devised a model based on Bayesian autoregressive moving average logistic multinomial regression to allow rigorous comparison. This revealed that B.1.617.2 (delta) showed three-fold enrichment in vaccine breakthrough cases (odds ratio of 3; 95% credible interval 0.89-11). Viral point substitutions could also be associated with vaccine breakthroughs, notably the N501Y substitution found in the alpha, beta and gamma variants (odds ratio 2.04; 95% credible interval of 1.25-3.18). This study thus provides a detailed picture of viral evolution in the Delaware Valley and a geographically matched analysis of vaccine breakthroughs; it also introduces a rigorous statistical approach to interrogating enrichment of viral variants.</p><sec><title>Importance</title><p>SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is highly effective at reducing viral infection, hospitalization and death.

Here we report analysis of 2621 surveillance isolates from xsxpeople diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Delaware Valley in South Eastern Pennsylvania, allowing rigorous comparison to 159 vaccine breakthrough case specimens. Our best estimate is a three-fold enrichment for some lineages of delta among breakthroughs, and enrichment of a notable spike substitution, N501Y. We introduce statistical methods that should be widely useful for evaluating vaccine breakthroughs and other viral phenotypes.</p></sec>', 'posted': '2021-10-20'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.10.22.465012', 'tweets': 96, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Neuroscience', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Hippocampal spatio-temporal cognitive maps adaptively guide reward generalization', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Mona M Garvert'}, {'name': 'Tankred Saanum'}, {'name': 'Eric Schulz'}, {'name': 'Nicolas W Schuck'}, {'name': 'Christian F.

Mirroring behavior, the hippocampus not only builds a map of spatial relationships but also encodes temporal distances. As the task progresses, participants' choices become more influenced by spatial relationships, reflected in a strengthening of the spatial and a weakening of the temporal map. This change is driven by orbitofrontal cortex, which represents the evidence that an observed outcome is generated from the spatial rather than the temporal map and updates hippocampal representations accordingly.

Recently, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) isolated from breastmilk were found to inhibit GBS growth and biofilm formation in vitro, and women that make certain HMOs are less likely to be vaginally colonized with GBS. Using in vitro human vaginal epithelial cells and a murine vaginal colonization model, we tested the impact of HMO treatment on GBS burdens and the composition of the endogenous microbiota by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. HMO treatment reduced GBS vaginal burdens in vivo with minimal alterations to the vaginal microbiota. HMOs displayed potent inhibitory activity against GBS in vitro, but HMO pretreatment did not alter adherence of GBS or the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus to human vaginal epithelial cells. Additionally, disruption of a putative GBS glycosyltransferase (Δsan_0913) rendered the bacterium largely resistant to HMO inhibition in vitro and in vivo but did not compromise its adherence, colonization, or biofilm formation in the absence of HMOs.

Studies have attempted to understand SARS-CoV-2 S-protein interaction with vertebrate orthologs of ACE2 by expressing ACE2 orthologs in mammalian cells and measuring viral infection or S- protein binding. Often these cells only transiently express ACE2 proteins and levels of ACE2 at the cell surface are not quantified. Here, we describe a cell-based assay that uses stably transfected cells expressing ACE2 proteins in a bi-cistronic vector with an easy to quantify reporter protein to normalize ACE2 expression. We found that both binding of the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and infection with a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus is proportional to the amount of human ACE2 expressed at the cell surface, which can be inferred by quantifying the level of reporter protein, Thy1.1. We also compared different ACE2 orthologs which were expressed in stably transfected cells expressing equivalent levels of Thy1.1. When ranked for either viral infectivity or RBD binding, mouse ACE2 had a weak to undetectable affinity for S-protein while human ACE2 was the highest level detected and feline ACE2 had an intermediate phenotype. The generation of stably transfected cells whose ACE2 level can be normalized for cross-ortholog comparisons allows us to create a reusable cellular library useful for measuring emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant’s ability to potentially infect different animals.</p>', 'posted': '2021-10-23'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.10.21.465363', 'tweets': 14, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Plant Biology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'A Null Allele of the Pol IV Second Subunit is Viable in Oryza sativa', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Tania Chakraborty'}, {'name': 'Joshua T.

A pathological increase in these forces can induce morphological change to podocytes, their detachment from the glomerular basement membrane and subsequent loss into the primary urine. The ability to sense and respond to variations in mechanical force would be beneficial to a cell exposed to these conditions. It is likely podocytes have such mechanisms, however their identity are unknown. Here we investigated the hypothesis that the mechanotransducer Piezo is involved in a mechanotransduction pathway in Drosophila nephrocytes, the podocyte homologue in the fly. We find Piezo is expressed in nephrocytes and localizes to the nephrocyte diaphragm. The Piezo agonist YODA, which stimulates channel opening in the absence of mechanical force, leads to a significant increase in intracellular Ca++ upon shear stress in the nephrocyte. This leads to activation of Rho1, delineating a putative Piezo mechanotransductive pathway in these cells. Loss of function analysis revealed minor defects in nephrocyte filtration function. In contrast, we show that elevated Piezo levels resulted in constantly oscillating Ca++ signals even in the absence of shear stress, increased active Rho1 and accumulation of actin stress fibers, culminating in a severe nephrocyte filtration phenotype, suggesting that pathway hyperactivity is detrimental. We asked if this phenotype could be reversed by blocking Piezo activity pharmacologically using the tarantula toxin GsMTx4. Treatment with GsMTx4 brought levels of activated Rho1 into the normal range.

Previous studies have shown that tree cover shows bimodal distributions for intermediate rainfall regimes in Africa and South America. In this study, we construct a vegetation state diagram by plotting vegetation cover as a function of mean annual rainfall for Northeast India, which is part of the Eastern Himalaya and the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot. We use remotely sensed satellite data of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as a proxy for vegetation cover. We obtain Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) from the CHIRPS data (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data). We find that EVI increases monotonically as a function of MAP in the range 1000-2000 mm, after which it plateaus.

While the T478K mutation, also seen in the alpha variant, has evidence for increased transmissibility, these data suggest that the delta variant shows overall increased fitness seeing as it outcompeted the B.1.1519 this Mexico community.</p>', 'posted': '2021-10-20'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.10.20.21265279', 'tweets': 4, 'archive': 'medRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology', 'covid': True, 'title': 'Factors affecting the mental health of pregnant women using UK maternity services during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative interview study', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'A R McKinlay'}, {'name': 'D Fancourt'}, {'name': 'A Burton'}]\", 'abstract': '<sec><title>Background</title><p>People using maternity services in the United Kingdom (UK) have faced significant changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing regulations.

Many participants felt a sense of loss over a pregnancy experience that differed so remarkably to what they had expected because of the pandemic. Supportive relationships were important to help cope with pregnancy and pandemic-related changes; but feelings of isolation were compounded for some participants because opportunities to build social connections through face-to-face parent groups were unavailable.

Reduced social support and being unable to have a partner or support person present during maternity service use were the greatest concerns reported by women in this study, as this absence removed a protective buffer in times of uncertainty and distress. This suggests that the availability of a birth partner or support person must be prioritised wherever possible to protect the mental health of women experiencing pregnancy and miscarriage in times of pandemics.</p></sec>', 'posted': '2021-10-20'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.10.13.21264946', 'tweets': 3, 'archive': 'medRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Intensive Care and Critical Care Medicine', 'covid': True, 'title': 'Clinical observation of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with non-rebreather mask (NRM) use on severe or critically ill COVID-19 diabetic patients', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'AFM Tareq Bhuiyan'}, {'name': 'Sudipta Deb Nath'}, {'name': 'Shuva Das'}, {'name': 'Moumita Das'}, {'name': 'Rajdeep Biswas'}, {'name': 'Moinul Ahsan'}, {'name': 'Md.

This study aimed to investigate and compare the efficacy of High-flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) with/without non-rebreather mask (NRM) on critical COVID-19 patients with/without diabetes. \\nMaterials and methods: For analysis and comparison, epidemiological, biochemical, and clinical data were collected from 240 HFNC±NRM treated severe and critical COVID-19 ICU patients (diabetic = 136; non-diabetic = 104) of five hospitals in Chattogram, Bangladesh. \\nResults and Discussion: 59.1% patients with fever had diabetes (p=0.012). ICU stay was longer for diabetic patients (9.06±5.70) than non-diabetic ones (7.41±5.11) (p=0.020). Majority of hypertensive patients were diabetic (68.3%; p&lt;0.001). Most of the diabetic patients (70.4%; p&lt;0.005) had elevated creatinine levels. The partial pressure of oxygen after HFNC (only) was significantly (p=0.031) higher in non-diabetic patients (69.30±23.56) than diabetic ones (61.50±14.49). Diabetic (62.64±13.05) and non-diabetic patients (59.40±13.22) had similar partial pressure of oxygen from HFNC+NRM. Majority of the diabetic patients who required HFNC+NRM had elevated RBS (73.8%; p=0.001) and creatinine (75.7%; p=0.009). Factors affecting the HFNC only treated patients were fever and impaired glucose tolerance. Besides, increased plasma glucose level, age, and hypertension affected the HFNC + NRM treated diabetic patients.\\nConclusion: The results of this study imply that oxygen supply with HFNC+NRM may be beneficial for the elderly/hypertensive diabetic patients with COVID-19 associated AHRF; and that IGT and increased blood glucose levels could be determinants for COVID-19 severity. However, further experiments to substantiate these claims are required on a larger sample and among different clinical cohorts.</p>\", 'posted': '2021-10-18'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.10.19.465067', 'tweets': 3, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Microbiology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Phospho-regulation accommodates Type III secretion and assembly of a tether of ER-Chlamydia inclusion membrane contact sites', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Rebecca L.

CK2-mediated phosphorylation of a C-terminal region of IncV enables IncV hyperphosphorylation of a phospho- FFAT motif core and serine-rich tracts immediately upstream of IncV FFAT motif cores. Phosphorylatable serine tracts, rather than genetically-encoded acidic tracts, accommodate Type III-mediated translocation of IncV to the inclusion membrane, while achieving full mimicry of FFAT motifs.
