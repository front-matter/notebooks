In this study, we performed integrated single-cell RNA- and scATAC-seq analysis in both mouse and human retina to profile dynamic changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility and transcription factor footprinting during retinal neurogenesis. We identified multiple interconnected, evolutionarily-conserved GRNs consisting of cell type-specific transcription factors that both activate expression of genes within their own network and often inhibit expression of genes in other networks. These GRNs control state transitions within primary retinal progenitors that underlie temporal patterning, regulate the transition from primary to neurogenic progenitors, and drive specification of each major retinal cell type.

Here we used environmental metagenomics combined with analysis of physico-chemical data and 16S rRNA amplicons to characterize the diversity, temperature optima, and biogeographic distribution of sediment-hosted microorganisms at the recently discovered Auka vents in the Gulf of California, the deepest known hydrothermal vent field in the Pacific Ocean. We recovered 325 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) representing 54 phyla, over 1/3 of the currently known phylum diversity, showing the microbial community in Auka hydrothermal sediments is highly diverse. Large scale 16S rRNA amplicon screening of 227 sediment samples across the vent field indicates that the MAGs are largely representative of the microbial community. Metabolic reconstruction of a vent-specific, deeply branching clade within the Desulfobacterota (Tharpobacteria) suggests these organisms metabolize sulfur using novel octaheme cytochrome-c proteins related to hydroxylamine oxidoreductase. Community-wide comparison of the average nucleotide identity of the Auka MAGs with MAGs from the Guaymas Basin vent field, found 400 km to the Northwest, revealed a remarkable 20% species-level overlap between vent sites, suggestive of long-distance species transfer and sediment colonization. An adapted version of a recently developed model for predicting optimal growth temperature to the Auka and Guaymas MAGs indicates several of these uncultured microorganisms could grow at temperatures exceeding the currently known upper limit of life. Extending this analysis to reference data shows that thermophily is a trait that has evolved frequently among Bacteria and Archaea. Combined, our results show that Auka vent field offers new perspectives on our understanding of hydrothermal vent microbiology.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-02'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.03.454952', 'tweets': 56, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Plant Biology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'High expression of VRT2 during wheat spikelet initiation increases the number of rudimentary basal spikelets', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Anna E.

The acropetal gradient correlates with the developmental age of spikelets, however the basal spikelets are developed first and the cause of their small size and rudimentary development is unclear. Here, we adapted G&amp;T-seq, a low-input transcriptomics approach, to characterise gene expression profiles within spatial sections of individual spikes before and after the establishment of the lanceolate shape.

Initially we compared effective (clozapine and haloperidol) antipsychotics to a candidate drug that failed in clinical trials (MP-10). Clozapine and haloperidol normalized hyperdopaminergic D1-SPN dynamics, while MP-10 only normalized D2-SPN activity.

This exposure can result in neuropsychiatric abnormalities that persist into adolescence and, in some cases, adulthood.

However, the machinery for genetically encoding noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) is only available in limited plasmid formats, constraining potential applications. In extreme cases, the introduction of two separate plasmids, one containing an orthogonal translation system (OTS) to facilitate ncAA incorporation and a second for expressing a ncAA-containing protein of interest, is not possible due to lack of convenient selection markers. One strategy to circumvent this challenge is to express the OTS and protein of interest from a single vector. For what we believe is the first time in yeast, we describe here several sets of single plasmid systems (SPSs) for performing genetic code manipulation and compare the ncAA incorporation capabilities of these plasmids against the capabilities of previously described dual plasmid systems (DPSs). For both dual fluorescent protein reporters and yeast display reporters tested with multiple OTSs and ncAAs, measured ncAA incorporation efficiencies with SPSs were determined to be equal to or improved relative to efficiencies determined with DPSs. Click chemistry on yeast cells displaying ncAA-containing proteins was also shown to be feasible in both formats, although differences in reactivity between formats suggest the need for caution when using such approaches. Additionally, we investigated whether these reporters would support separation of yeast strains known to exhibit distinct ncAA incorporation efficiencies. Model sorts conducted with mixtures of two strains transformed with the same SPS or DPS led to enrichment of a strain known to support higher efficiency ncAA incorporation, suggesting that these reporters will be suitable for conducting screens for strains exhibiting enhanced ncAA incorporation efficiencies. Overall, our results confirm that SPSs are well-behaved in yeast and provide a convenient alternative to DPSs. In particular, SPSs are expected to be invaluable for conducting high-throughput investigations of the effects of genetic or genomic changes on ncAA incorporation efficiency and, more fundamentally, the eukaryotic translation apparatus.</p><sec><title>Abstract Figure</title><fig id=\"ufig1\" position=\"float\" fig-type=\"figure\" orientation=\"portrait\"><graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"454837v1_ufig1\" position=\"float\" orientation=\"portrait\" /></fig></sec>', 'posted': '2021-08-03'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.02.454535', 'tweets': 9, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Scientific Communication and Education', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Myth-busting the provider-user relationship for digital sequence information', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Amber Hartman Scholz'}, {'name': 'Matthias Lange'}, {'name': 'Pia Habekost'}, {'name': 'Paul Oldham'}, {'name': 'Ibon Cancio'}, {'name': 'Guy Cochrane'}, {'name': 'Jens Freitag'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) formally recognized the sovereign rights of nations over their biological diversity.

Interference competition, as the name implies, is a form of direct interference to prevent resource access. Interference competition is common among animals who can physically fight, but in plants, one of the main mechanisms of interference competition is Allelopathy. allelopathic plants release of cytotoxic chemicals into the environment which can increase their ability to compete with surrounding organisms for limited resources. The circumstances and conditions favoring the development and maintenance of allelochemicals, however, is not well understood. Particularly, it seems strange that, despite the obvious benefits of allelopathy, it seems to have only rarely evolved. To gain insight into the cost and benefit of allelopathy, we have developed a 2 × 2 matrix game to model the interaction between plants that produce allelochemicals and plants that do not. Production of an allelochemical introduces novel cost associated with synthesis and detoxifying a toxic chemical but may also convey a competitive advantage. A plant that does not produce an allelochemical will suffer the cost of encountering one. Our model predicts three cases in which the evolutionarily stable strategies are different. In the first, the non-allelopathic plant is a stronger competitor, and not producing allelochemicals is the evolutionarily stable strategy. In the second, the allelopathic plant is the better competitor and production of allelochemicals is the more beneficial strategy. In the last case, neither is the evolutionarily stable strategy. Instead, there are alternating stable states, depending on whether the allelopathic or non-allelopathic plant arrived first. The generated model reveals circumstances leading to the evolution of allelochemicals and sheds light on utilizing allelochemicals as part of weed management strategies. In particular, the wide region of alternative stable states in most parameterizations, combined with the fact that the absence of allelopathy is likely the ancestral state, provides an elegant answer to the question of why allelopathy rarely evolves despite its obvious benefits. Allelopathic plants can indeed outcompete non-allelopathic plants, but this benefit is simply not great enough to allow them to go to fixation and spread through the population. Thus, most populations would remain purely non-allelopathic.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-05'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.03.454759', 'tweets': 7, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Evolutionary Biology', 'covid': False, 'title': 'First observation of Aedes albopictus in the Tshuapa province (Boende) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Joachim Mariën'}, {'name': 'Nicolas Laurent'}, {'name': 'Nathalie Smitz'}, {'name': 'Sophie Gombeer'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>In May-June 2021, we detected <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> adults near the central hospital in Boende, the capital city of the Tshuapa province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

We observed a developmental age associated decline in microbial richness and diversity, accompanied by a decline in the presence of growth promoting and resistance inducing bacilli in the phyllosphere. This decline was absent from CK-rich or CK-hypersensitive genotypes. Bacillus isolates we obtained from CK rich genotypes were found to re-program the transcriptome to support morphogenesis and alter the leaf developmental program when applied to seedlings, and enhance yield and agricultural productivity when applied to mature plants. Our results support the notion that CK-dependent effects on microbiome content support developmental functions, suggesting that these are mediated by CK in part via the bacterial community.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-02'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.03.21261494', 'tweets': 6, 'archive': 'medRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Genetic and Genomic Medicine', 'covid': False, 'title': 'Mapping genetic determinants of 184 circulating proteins in 26,494 individuals to connect proteins and disease.', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Erin Macdonald-Dunlop'}, {'name': 'Lucija Klarić'}, {'name': 'Lasse Folkersen'}, {'name': 'Paul R.H.J.

We examined these interactions in the murine mammary gland. Luminal and myoepithelial subpopulations of the postnatal mammary gland arise from unipotent progenitors, but the destiny of cap cells, which enclose terminal end buds (TEB) in pubertal mice, remains controversial. Using a transgenic strain (Tg11.5kb-GFP) that specifically marks cap cells, we found ~50% of these cells undergo divisions perpendicular to the TEB surface, suggesting they might contribute to the underlying luminal cell population. To address their stemness potential we developed a lineage tracing mouse driven from the s-SHIP (11.5 kb) promoter. Induction of tdTomato (tdTom) from this promoter in vivo demonstrated that all cap cell progeny are myoepithelial, with no conversion to luminal lineage. Organoid cultures also exhibited unipotency. However, isolated cap cells cultured as mammospheres generated mixed luminal/myoepithelial spheres. Moreover, ablation of luminal cells in vivo using diphtheria toxin triggered repopulation by progeny of tdTom+ cap cells. A signaling inhibitor screen identified the TGFb pathway as a potential regulator of multipotency. TGFbR inhibitors or gene deletion blocked conversion to the luminal lineage, consistent with an autocrine loop in which cap cells secrete TGFb to activate the receptor and promote luminal transdifferentiation. Ductal tree regeneration in vivo from isolated cap cells was much more efficient when they were pre-treated with inhibitor, consistent with more cells retaining cap cell potential prior to transplantation. Notably, in vitro transdifferentiation of cap cells was blocked by co-culture with luminal cells. Overall, these data reveal a self-limiting cell circuit through which mammary luminal cells suppress cap cell conversion to the luminal lineage.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-05'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.02.21261459', 'tweets': 5, 'archive': 'medRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Epidemiology', 'covid': True, 'title': 'Dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in India and Pakistan: A metapopulation modelling approach', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Samantha J.

We present a base mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in India and its neighbor, Pakistan. The base model, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, is parameterized using cumulative COVID-19 mortality data from each of the two countries. The model was used to assess the population-level impact of the control and mitigation strategies implemented in the two countries (notably community lockdowns, use of face masks, and social-distancing). Numerical simulations of the basic model indicate that, based on the current baseline levels of the control and mitigation strategies implemented, the pandemic trajectory in India is on a downward trend (as characterized by the reproduction number of the disease dynamics in India below, but close to, unity). This downward trend will be reversed, and India will be recording mild outbreaks (i.e., pandemic waves), if the control and mitigation strategies are relaxed from their current levels (e.g., relaxed to the extent that the associated community transmission parameters are increased by 20% or 40% from their current baseline values). Our simulations suggest that India could record up to 460,000 cumulative deaths by early September 2021 under the baseline levels of the control strategies implemented (up to 25,000 of the projected deaths could be averted if the control and mitigation measures are strengthened to the extent that the associated community transmission parameters are reduced by 20% from their baseline values). Our simulations show that the pandemic in Pakistan is much milder, with an estimated projected cumulative mortality of about 24,000 by early September 2021 under the baseline scenario. The basic model was extended to assess the impact of back-and-forth mobility between the two countries. Simulations of the resulting metapopulation model, which uses a Lagrangian mobility framework (based on residence-time spent in each country), shows that the burden of the pandemic in Pakistan increases with increasing values of the average time residents of India spend in Pakistan. In particular, it is shown that the India-to-Pakistan mobility pattern may trigger a significant fourth wave of the pandemic in Pakistan (under certain mobility scenarios and mitigation levels), with daily mortality peaking in mid-August to mid-September of 2021. It is also shown that extending the current travel restrictions by at least three months would significantly enhance the prospect of eliminating the pandemic in both countries. On the other hand, it is shown that, in addition to causing future multiple waves of the pandemic, easing the current levels of control and mitigation measures in the two countries (including travel restrictions) would result in delaying pandemic elimination in India and Pakistan to November and July 2022, respectively.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-05'}, {'doi': '10.1101/2021.08.06.455441', 'tweets': 5, 'archive': 'bioRxiv', 'subject-area': 'Microbiology', 'covid': True, 'title': 'VPS29 exerts opposing effects on endocytic viral entry', 'authors': \"[{'name': 'Daniel Poston'}, {'name': 'Yiska Weisblum'}, {'name': 'Alvaro Hobbs'}, {'name': 'Paul D Bieniasz'}]\", 'abstract': '<p>Emerging zoonotic viral pathogens threaten global health and there is an urgent need to discover host and viral determinants influencing infection.

To address this drawback, we herein developed an aptamer-based PROTAC ZL216 using aptamer AS1411 as a targeting ligand for nucleolin, and it showed both excellent serum stability and water solubility. Based on the differential expression of nucleolin on the cell surface, ZL216 can specifically bind to and internalize into breast cancer cells, but not normal breast cells. Furthermore, we revealed that ZL216 promoted the formation of a nucleolin-ZL216-VHL ternary complex in breast cancer cells and potently induced the degradation of nucleolin in vitro and in vivo, thereby inhibiting the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. These studies demonstrated the potential of utilizing aptamers to construct PROTACs to achieve the selective degradation of targeted protein in tumor cells and provided a promising strategy for the development of tumor-selective PROTACs.</p>', 'posted': '2021-08-05'}]\n"
