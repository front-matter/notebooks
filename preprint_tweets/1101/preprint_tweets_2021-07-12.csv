Among a clinical laboratory that has been conducting routine workforce screening since the beginning of the pandemic, we aimed to assess the relative risk of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among individuals who were SARS-CoV-2 naïve, previously infected, or vaccinated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Using an electronic laboratory information system, employees were divided into three groups: (1) SARS-CoV-2 naïve and unvaccinated, (2) previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and (3) vaccinated. Person-days were measured from the date of the employee first test and truncated at the end of the observation period. SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as two positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests in a 30-day period. Individuals with fewer than 14 days of follow up were excluded. Incidence estimates and the 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the Poisson Exact equation. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) was used as a measure of association between groups. Analyses were performed on StataSE (StataCorp, College Station, TX).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We identified 4313, 254 and 739 employee records for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The median age of employees was 29.0 years (interquartile range: 23.6, 39.9). During the observation period, 254, 0, and 4 infections were identified among groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Group 1 had an incidence of 25.9 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 22.8-29.3). Group 2 had an incidence of 0 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0-5.0). Group 3 had an incidence of 1.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 0.04-4.2). The IRR of reinfection among those with previous infection compared to SARS-CoV-2 naïve was 0 (95% CI: 0-0.19). The IRR of those vaccinated compared to SARS-CoV-2 naïve was 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02-0.16). The IRR of those vaccinated compared to prior SARS-CoV-2 was 0 (95% CI: 0-4.98).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 were associated with decreased risk for infection or re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in a routinely screened workforce. The was no difference in the infection incidence between vaccinated individuals and individuals with previous infection. Further research is needed to determine whether our results are consistent with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p></sec>",2021-07-07

Several recent genomic and simulation-based studies have argued that the field of conservation biology has placed too much focus on the conservation of genome-wide genetic variation, and that this approach should be replaced with another that focuses instead on managing the subset of functional genetic variation that is thought to affect fitness. Here, we critically evaluate the feasibility and likely benefits of this approach in conservation. We find that population genetics theory and empirical results show that the conserving genome-wide genetic variation is generally the best approach to prevent inbreeding depression and loss of adaptive potential from driving populations towards extinction. Focusing conservation efforts on presumably functional genetic variation will only be feasible occasionally, often misleading, and counterproductive when prioritized over genome-wide genetic variation. Given the increasing rate of habitat loss and other environmental changes, failure to recognize the detrimental effects of lost genome-wide variation on long-term population viability will only worsen the biodiversity crisis.</p>",2021-07-06

However, the frequent occurrences of immune-related Adverse Events (irAEs) following checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) treatment suggest a hypothesis that immunologically healthy individuals have self-reactive effector T cells that are kept in a non-pathogenic state through checkpoint receptor-mediated suppression, instead of anergy or deletion. We expressed self-antigens in healthy skin and found that antigen-specific CD8 T cells infiltrated the tissue, but remained tolerant, despite having a transcriptional program that resembled effector T cells found after CPIs. These self-reactive PD-1+ CD8 T cells drove IFNg-dependent increases in PD-L1 on skin myeloid cells. Blockade of PD-1 or PD-1/CTLA-4 led to post-transcriptional upregulation of effector proteins by antigen-specific CD8 T cells and elimination of antigen-expressing epithelial cells, resulting in localized tissue pathology with features of human cutaneous irAEs. This data supports the hypothesis that myeloid cells in healthy skin prevent pathology from self-reactive effector CD8 T cells through the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.</p>",2021-07-10

In this study, we introduce a new approach to establishing construct validity of trust using “neurometrics”. We develop a whole-brain multivariate pattern capable of classifying whether new participants will trust a relationship partner in the context of a cooperative interpersonal investment game (n=40) with 90% accuracy and find that it also generalizes to a variant of the same task collected in a different country with 82% accuracy (n=17). Moreover, we establish the convergent and discriminant validity by testing the pattern on eleven separate datasets (n=496) and find that trust is reliably related to beliefs of safety, inversely related to negative affect, but unrelated to reward, cognitive control, social perception, and self-referential processing. Together these results provide support for the notion that the psychological experience of trust contains elements of beliefs of reciprocation and fear of betrayal aversion. Contrary to our predictions, we found no evidence that trust is related to anticipated reward. This work demonstrates how “neurometrics” can be used to characterize the psychological processes associated with brain-based multivariate representations.</p>",2021-07-05

A major challenge in the neuroscience of balance is to link the synaptic and cellular substrates that encode body tilts to specific behaviors that stabilize posture and enable efficient locomotion. Here we address this problem by measuring the development, synaptic architecture, and behavioral contributions of vestibulospinal neurons in the larval zebrafish. First, we find that vestibulospinal neurons are born and are functionally mature before larvae swim freely, allowing them to act as a substrate for postural regulation. Next, we map the synaptic inputs to vestibulospinal neurons that allow them to encode posture. Further, we find that this synaptic architecture allows them to respond to linear acceleration in a directionally-tuned and utricle-dependent manner; they are thus poised to guide corrective movements. After loss of vestibulospinal neurons, larvae adopted eccentric postures with disrupted movement timing and weaker corrective kinematics. We used a generative model of swimming to demonstrate that together these disruptions can account for the increased postural variability. Finally, we observed that lesions disrupt vestibular-dependent coordination between the fins and trunk during vertical swimming, linking vestibulospinal neurons to navigation. We conclude that vestibulospinal neurons turn synaptic representations of body tilt into defined corrective behaviors and coordinated movements. As the need for stable locomotion is common and the vestibulospinal circuit is highly conserved our findings reveal general mechanisms for neuronal control of balance.</p>",2021-07-05

The genetic and evolutionary forces that WGD imposes upon cytoplasmic genomes are not well understood, despite the central role that cytonuclear interactions play in eukaryotic function and fitness. Cellular respiration and photosynthesis depend upon successful interaction between the 3000+ nuclear-encoded proteins destined for the mitochondria or plastids and the gene products of cytoplasmic genomes in multi-subunit complexes such as OXPHOS, organellar ribosomes, Photosystems I and II, and Rubisco. Allopolyploids are thus faced with the critical task of coordinating interactions between nuclear and cytoplasmic genes that were inherited from different species. Because cytoplasmic genomes share a more recent history of common descent with the maternal nuclear subgenome than the paternal subgenome, evolutionary ""mismatches"" between the paternal subgenome and the cytoplasmic genomes in allopolyploids might lead to accelerated rates of evolution in the paternal homoeologs of allopolyploids, either through relaxed purifying selection or strong directional selection to rectify these mismatches. We tested this hypothesis in maternal vs. paternal copies of organelle-targeted genes in six allotetraploids: Brachypodium hybridum, Chenopodium quinoa, Coffea arabica, Gossypium hirsutum, Nicotiana tabacum, and Triticum dicoccoides. We report evidence that allopolyploid subgenomes exhibit unequal rates of protein-sequence evolution, but we did not observe global effects of cytonuclear incompatibilities on paternal homoeologs of organelle-targeted genes. Analyses of gene content revealed mixed evidence for whether organelle-targeted genes re-diploidize more rapidly than non-organelle-targeted genes. Together, these global analyses provide insights into the complex evolutionary dynamics of allopolyploids, showing that allopolyploid subgenomes have separate evolutionary trajectories despite sharing the same nucleus, generation time, and ecological context.</p>",2021-07-09

We find that interactions with the alga alter the magnitude but not the sign of the fitness effects of adaptive mutations in yeast, changing the distribution of mutants contending for fixation.

By manipulating the cerebellum, we identified pairs of thalamic and retrosplenial HD cells that lose their temporal coordination in the absence of external sensory drive, while the neuronal coordination within each of these brain regions remained intact.

Experience sampling in one of the meditation conditions allowed us to disentangle periods of breath focus from mind wandering (i.e. moments of distraction driven by task-irrelevant thoughts) during meditation practice. Overall, meditators reported a greater level of focus and reduced mind wandering during meditation practice than controls. In line with these reports, EEG spectral modulations associated to meditation and mind wandering also differed significantly between meditators and controls.

We apply this method to measure presynaptic activity in an ultrastructural context in synapses activated by sensory input in primary visual cortex in awake head-fixed mice, showing that the numbers of recycling and non-recycling vesicles approximate to a lognormal distribution across a large number of synapses.

Palacios-Gimenez'}],"<p>To test the hypothesis that high speciation rate in groups is coupled with high rate of karyotype evolution but also that younger groups having a higher rate of karyotypic diversity, I estimated rates of speciation and rates of karyotype evolution in 1,177 species belonging to 26 families in the insect order Orthoptera. Rates of karyotype evolution were estimated using the diploid number and the number of chromosome arms (fundamental number) from published karyotypes of Orthoptera. Rates of speciation were quantified considering the number of species examined karyotypically in each family, the most recent common ancestor of each family and the information about extinction rate. The rate of speciation was strongly correlated with rate of karyotype evolution and the average rates of speciation was nearly ~177 times higher than the background rate estimated for Orthoptera based on acoustic communication using phylogenomic data, as well as 8.4 and 35.6 times higher than the estimated speciation rate in vertebrates and bivalve mollusks respectively, indicating that Orthoptera has evolved very fast at chromosomal level. The findings supported the hypothesis of a high speciation rate in lineages with high rate of chromosomal evolution but there were not evidences that younger groups tended to have higher rate of karyotypic diversity. Furthermore, rates of karyotype evolution most closely fitted the punctuational evolutionary model indicating the existence of long periods of stasis of karyotype change with most karyotype change occurring quickly over short evolutionary times. I discussed genetic drift, divergent selection and meiotic drive as potential biological mechanisms to explain karyotype evolution allowing or impeding for the fixation of chromosomal rearrangements and in turn speciation in orthopterans lineages.</p>",2021-07-07

However, the extraction and integration of word meaning from the parafoveal word and its possible influence on the semantic sentence context are controversial. In the current study, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in the RSVP-with-flankers paradigm to test whether and how updates of sentential meaning that are based only on parafoveal information influence the subsequent foveal processing. Using Chinese sentences, the sentence congruency of parafoveal and foveal target words were orthogonally manipulated. In contrast to previous research, we also controlled for potentially confounding effects of parafoveal-to-foveal repetition priming (identity preview effects) on the N400. Crucially, we found that the classic effect of foveal congruency on the N400 component only appeared when the word in preview had been congruent with sentence meaning; in contrast, there was no N400 when the preview word had been incongruent. These results indicate that sentence meaning rapidly adapts to parafoveal preview, which already changes the context for the then fixated word. We also show that a correct parafoveal preview generally attenuates the N400 once a word is fixated, regardless of congruency. Taken together, our findings underline the highly generative and adaptive framework of language comprehension.</p>",2021-07-07

Paired 3T and 64mT brain images were used to develop and validate a transformation converting standard clinical images to ULF-quality images. Separately, 3T images were aggregated from open-source databases spanning four neuropathologies: low-grade glioma (LGG, N=76), high-grade glioma (HGG, N=259), stroke (N=28), and multiple sclerosis (MS, N=20). The transformation method was then applied to the open-source data to generate simulated ULF images for each pathology. Convolutional neural networks (DenseNet-121) were trained to detect pathology in axial slices from either 3T or simulated 64 mT images, and their relative performance was compared to characterize the potential diagnostic capabilities of ULF imaging. Algorithm performance was measured using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Across all cohorts, pathology detection was similar between 3T and simulated 64mT images (LGG: 0.97 vs. 0.98; HGG: 0.96 vs. 0.95; stroke: 0.94 vs. 0.94; MS: 0.90 vs 0.87). Pathology detection was further characterized as a function of lesion size, intensity, and contrast. Simulated images showed decreasing sensitivity for lesions smaller than 4 cm<sup>2</sup> (∼2.25 cm in diameter). While simulations cannot replace prospective trials during the evaluation of medical devices, they can provide guidance and justification for prospective studies.

Depending on the brain region studied, distinct effects of atRA on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission have been reported. However, it remains unclear how atRA mediates brain region-specific effects on synaptic transmission and plasticity. Here, we used intraperitoneal injections of atRA (10 mg/kg) in adult male C57BL/6J mice to study the effects of atRA on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the mouse fascia dentata. In contrast to what has been reported in other brain regions, no major changes in synaptic transmission were observed in the ventral and dorsal hippocampus 6 hours after atRA administration. Likewise, no evidence for changes in the intrinsic properties of hippocampal dentate granule cells was obtained in the atRA-treated group. Moreover, hippocampal transcriptome analysis revealed no essential changes upon atRA treatment. In light of these findings, we tested for the metaplastic effects of atRA, i.e., for its ability to modulate synaptic plasticity expression in the absence of major changes in baseline synaptic transmission. Indeed, <italic>in vivo</italic> long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments demonstrated that systemic atRA treatment improves the ability of dentate granule cells to express LTP. The plasticity-promoting effects of atRA were not observed in synaptopodin-deficient mice, thus extending our previous results on the relevance of synaptopodin in atRA-mediated synaptic strengthening in the mouse prefrontal cortex.

Following the near-absence of historical examples of the long-time evolution of infectious diseases under similar circumstances, models are crucial to exemplify possible scenarios. Accordingly, in the present work we systematically generalize the popular susceptible-infectedrecovered model to account for mutations leading to repeatedly occurring new strains, which we coarse grain based on tools from statistical mechanics to derive a model predicting the most likely outcomes. The model predicts that mutations can induce a super-exponential growth of infection numbers at early times, which can self-amplify to giant infection waves which are caused by a positive feedback loop between infection numbers and mutations and lead to a simultaneous infection of the majority of the population. At later stages – if vaccination progresses too slowly – mutations can interrupt an ongoing decrease of infection numbers and can cause infection revivals which can occur as single waves or even as whole wave trains featuring alternative periods of decreasing and increasing infection numbers. Our results might be useful for discussions regarding the importance of a release of vaccine-patents to reduce the risk of mutation-induced infection revivals but also to coordinate the release of measures following a downwards trend of infection numbers.</p>",2021-07-07

At the same time, studies have linked some migraine symptoms to Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) profiles. Unfortunately, previous studies associating migraine symptoms and QST have important methodological shortcomings, stemming from inappropriate statistics, small sample sizes, and frequent use of univariate statistics for multivariate research questions. In the current study we seek to address these limitations by using a large sample of episodic migraine patients (n=103) and a multivariate analysis that associates pain ratings from many thermal intensities simultaneously with 12 clinical measures ranging from headache frequency to sleep abnormalities. We identified a single dimension of association between QST and migraine symptoms that relates to pain ratings for all stimulus intensities and a subset of migraine symptoms relating to disability (Headache Impact Trauma 6 and Brief Pain Inventory interference), catastrophizing (Pain Catastrophizing Scale), and pain severity (average headache pain, Brief Pain Inventory severity, and Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire 2). Headache frequency, allodynia, affect, and sleep disturbances were unrelated to this dimension. Consistent with previous research, we did not observe any difference in QST ratings between migraine patients and healthy controls. Additionally, we found that the linear combination of symptoms that related to QST were modified by mind-body therapy. These results suggest that QST has a selective relationship with pain symptoms even in the absence of between-subjects differences between chronic pain patients and healthy controls.</p><sec><title>Highlights</title><list list-type=""bullet""><list-item><p>Experimentally evoked pain ratings have been linked to migraine symptoms, though there are methodological shortcomings</p></list-item><list-item><p>We find evoked pain ratings are related to disability, pain catastrophizing, and pain severity, but not to headache frequency, affect, nor sleep disturbances</p></list-item><list-item><p>Evoked pain and symptoms relate even in the absence of pain sensitivity differences between patients and healthy controls</p></list-item><list-item><p>Mind-body therapy altered symptoms that related to evoked pain</p></list-item><list-item><p>Experimentally evoked pain should be used to study specific ensembles of symptoms, even when pain ratings do not differ between patients and healthy controls</p></list-item></list></sec>",2021-07-07

However, this interpretation discounts the complex activity of genetic enhancers and possible nonconical effects of alpha-synuclein. Here we investigate a novel risk mechanism for rs356182. We use CRISPR-Cas9 in LUHMES cells, a model for dopaminergic neurons, to generate precise hemizygous lesions at rs356182. The PD-protective (A/-), PD-risk (G/-), and WT (A/G) strains are differentiated into dopaminergic neurons then compared transcriptionally and morphologically. We observe effects not typically ascribed to <italic>SNCA</italic>; hundreds of differentially expressed genes associated with neuronal differentiation and axonogenesis. Together, the data implicate a risk mechanism for rs356182 in which the risk-allele (G) is associated with abnormal neuronal differentiation. We speculate the disease-relevant effect originates as a diminished population of DA neurons leading to the predisposition for PD later in life.</p></sec>",2021-07-08

When manual gating is used to define cell types, the gating hierarchy can be used to identify cell types whose abundances change relative to a parent population. This strategy allows subtle changes to be observed that could be missed if small subsets were compared to all measured cells. However, typical analyses that employ unsupervised clustering overlook the valuable hierarchical structure present in cell type definitions by exclusively quantifying the proportions of cell type clusters relative to all cells. We present treekoR, a framework that facilitates multiple quantifications and comparisons of cell type proportions. Our results from twelve case studies reinforce the importance of quantifying proportions relative to parent populations in the analyses of cytometry data - as failing to do so can lead to missing important biological insights.</p>",2021-07-09

HepT1 cells were injected into the livers or tail veins of mice, and tumor growth was monitored with magnetic resonance and bioluminescent imaging. Blood was analyzed with fluorescence activated cell sorting to identify CTCs. Intra- and extra-hepatic tumor samples were harvested for immunohistochemistry and RNA and DNA sequencing. Cell lines were grown from tumor samples and profiled with RNA sequencing. With intrahepatic injection of HepT1 cells, 100% of animals grew liver tumors and showed vascular invasion, metastasis, and CTCs. Mutation profiling revealed genetic alterations in seven cancer-related genes, while transcriptomic analyses showed changes in gene expression with cells that invade vessels. Tail vein injection of HepT1 cells resulted in multifocal, metastatic disease. These unique models will facilitate further meaningful studies of high-risk HB.</p>",2021-07-10

We surveyed 30 transects across eight habitats on St. Eustatius during 2017-2019, which resulted in 344 individual surveys and 98 iguana observations. Analyses of abundance and site occupancy indicated both measures for 2018 and 2019 were strongly reduced compared to the pre-hurricane 2017 state. Iguanas at higher elevations were affected more profoundly, likely due to higher wind speeds, tree damage and extensive defoliation. Overall, our results indicate a decrease in population estimates (23.3-26.5%) and abundance (22-23.8%) for 2018 and 2019, and a 75% reduction in the number of opportunistic sightings of tagged iguanas between 2017-2018.
