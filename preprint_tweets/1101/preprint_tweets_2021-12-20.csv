It has in the meantime spread to many countries and is expected to rapidly become dominant worldwide. The lineage is characterized by the presence of about 32 mutations in the Spike, located mostly in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor binding domain (RBD), which may enhance viral fitness and allow antibody evasion. Here, we isolated an infectious Omicron virus in Belgium, from a traveller returning from Egypt. We examined its sensitivity to 9 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) clinically approved or in development<sup>3</sup>, and to antibodies present in 90 sera from COVID-19 vaccine recipients or convalescent individuals. Omicron was totally or partially resistant to neutralization by all mAbs tested. Sera from Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine recipients, sampled 5 months after complete vaccination, barely inhibited Omicron. Sera from COVID-19 convalescent patients collected 6 or 12 months post symptoms displayed low or no neutralizing activity against Omicron. Administration of a booster Pfizer dose as well as vaccination of previously infected individuals generated an anti-Omicron neutralizing response, with titers 5 to 31 fold lower against Omicron than against Delta. Thus, Omicron escapes most therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and to a large extent vaccine-elicited antibodies.</p>",2021-12-15

We included individuals that were vaccinated recently (&lt;3 months), distantly (6-12 months), or recently boosted, and accounted for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remarkably, neutralization of Omicron was undetectable in most vaccinated individuals. However, individuals boosted with mRNA vaccines exhibited potent neutralization of Omicron only 4-6-fold lower than wild type, suggesting that boosters enhance the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibody responses. In addition, we find Omicron pseudovirus is more infectious than any other variant tested. Overall, this study highlights the importance of boosters to broaden neutralizing antibody responses against highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>",2021-12-14

In November 2021, the Omicron variant was discovered and classified as a variant of concern (VOC). Omicron shows substantially more mutations in the spike protein than any previous variant, mostly in the receptor binding domain (RBD).

Our recent work has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein activates the cellular TMEM16F chloride channel and scramblase. Through a screening on &gt;3,000 FDA/EMA approved drugs, we identified Niclosamide and Clofazimine as the most effective molecules at inhibiting this activity. As TMEM16F plays an important role in the stimulation of the pro-coagulant activity of platelets, and considering that platelet abnormalities are common in COVID-19 patients, we investigated whether Spike directly affects platelet activation and pro-thrombotic function and tested the effect of Niclosamide and Clofazimine on these processes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We produced SARS-CoV-2 Spike or VSV-G protein-pseudotyped virions, or generated cells expressing Spike on their plasma membrane, and tested their effects on platelet adhesion (fluorescence), aggregation (absorbance), exposure of phosphatidylserine (flow cytometry for annexin V binding), calcium flux (flow cytometry for fluo-4 AM), and clot formation and retraction. These experiments were also conducted in the presence of the TMEM16F activity inhibitors Niclosamide and Clofazimine.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here we show that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 Spike promotes platelet activation, adhesion and spreading, both when present on the envelope of virions or upon expression on the plasma membrane of cells. Spike was effective both as a sole agonist or by enhancing the effect of known platelet activators, such as collagen and collagen-related peptide. In particular, Spike exerted a noticeable effect on the procoagulant phenotype of platelets, by enhancing calcium flux, phosphatidylserine externalisation, and thrombin generation. Eventually, this resulted in a striking increase in thrombin-induced clot formation and retraction. Both Niclosamide and Clofazimine almost abolished this Spike-induced pro-coagulant response.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Together, these findings provide a pathogenic mechanism to explain thrombosis associated to COVID-19 lung disease, by which Spike present in SARS-CoV-2 virions or exposed on the surface of infected cells, leads to local platelet stimulation and subsequent activation of the coagulation cascade. As platelet TMEM16F is central in this process, these findings reinforce the rationale of repurposing drugs targeting this protein, such as Niclosamide, for COVID-19 therapy.</p></sec>",2021-12-15

Here, we report in vitro assembly conditions with recombinant tau that replicate the structures of filaments from both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), as determined by cryo-EM. Our results suggest that post-translational modifications of tau modulate filament assembly, and that previously observed additional densities in AD and CTE filaments may arise from the presence of inorganic salts, like phosphates and sodium chloride. In vitro assembly of tau into disease-relevant filaments will facilitate studies to determine their roles in different diseases, as well as the development of compounds that specifically bind to these structures or prevent their formation.</p>",2021-12-17

Uncanny similarities with amyloid-disease associated blood coagulation and fibrinolytic disturbances together with neurologic and cardiac problems led us to investigate the amyloidogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S-protein). Amyloid fibril assays of peptide library mixtures and theoretical predictions identified seven amyloidogenic sequences within the S-protein. All seven peptides in isolation formed aggregates during incubation at 37°C. Three 20-amino acid long synthetic Spike peptides (sequence 191-210, 599-618, 1165-1184) fulfilled three amyloid fibril criteria: nucleation dependent polymerization kinetics by ThT, Congo red positivity and ultrastructural fibrillar morphology. Full-length folded S-protein did not form amyloid fibrils, but amyloid-like fibrils with evident branching were formed during 24 hours of S-protein co-incubation with the protease neutrophil elastase (NE) in vitro. NE efficiently cleaved S-protein rendering exposure of amyloidogenic segments and accumulation of the peptide 193-202, part of the most amyloidogenic synthetic Spike peptide. NE is overexpressed at inflamed sites of viral infection and at vaccine injection sites. Our data propose a molecular mechanism for amyloidogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein in humans facilitated by endoproteolysis.

We developed a movement cost surface with a limited number of thematic categories using the most recently updated land cover data available for the country. We divided the country into 17 tiles and used a wall-to-wall, omnidirectional mode of Circuitscape on each tile in order to assess ecological connectivity throughout entire landscapes as opposed to strictly among protected areas. The resulting raw current density map of Canada revealed heterogenous patterns of current density across the country, strongly influenced by geography, natural barriers, and human development. We included a validation analysis of the output current density map with independent wildlife data from across the country and found that mammal and herpetofauna locations were predicted by areas of high current density.

Watson'}, {'name': 'Huda Akil'}]","<p>Evaluating and coping with stressful social events as they unfold is a critical strategy in overcoming them without long-lasting detrimental effects. Individuals display a wide range of responses to stress, which can manifest in a variety of outcomes for the brain as well as subsequent behavior. Chronic Social Defeat Stress (CSDS) in mice has been widely used to model individual variation following a social stressor. Following a course of repeated intermittent psychological and physical stress, mice diverge into separate populations of social reactivity: resilient (socially interactive) and susceptible (socially avoidant) animals. A rich body of work reveals distinct neurobiological and behavioral consequences of this experience that map onto the resilient and susceptible groups. However, the range of factors that emerge over the course of defeat have not been fully described. Therefore, in the current study, we focused on characterizing behavioral, physiological, and neuroendocrine profiles of mice in three separate phases: before, during, and following CSDS. We found that following CSDS, traditional read-outs of anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors do not map on to the resilient and susceptible groups. By contrast, behavioral coping strategies used during the initial social stress encounter better predict which mice will eventually become resilient or susceptible. In particular, mice that will emerge as susceptible display greater escape behavior on Day 1 of social defeat than those that will emerge as resilient, indicating early differences in coping mechanisms used between the two groups. We further show that the social avoidance phenotype in susceptible mice is specific to the aggressor strain and does not generalize to conspecifics or other strains, indicating that there may be features of threat discrimination that are specific to the susceptible mice. Our findings suggest that there are costs and benefits to both the resilient and susceptible outcomes, reflected in their ability to cope and adapt to the social stressor.</p>",2021-12-14

These measures of brain age, obtained from the general population, helped characterize disease severity in neurological populations, improving estimates of diagnosis or prognosis. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) have the potential to further generalize this approach towards prevention and public health by enabling assessments of brain health at large scales in socioeconomically diverse environments. However, more research is needed to define methods that can handle the complexity and diversity of M/EEG signals across diverse real-world contexts. To catalyse this effort, here we propose reusable benchmarks of competing machine learning approaches for brain age modeling. We benchmarked popular classical machine learning pipelines and deep learning architectures previously used for pathology decoding or brain age estimation in 4 international M/EEG cohorts from diverse countries and cultural contexts, including recordings from more than 2500 participants. Our benchmarks were built on top of the M/EEG adaptations of the BIDS standard, providing tools that can be applied with minimal modification on any M/EEG dataset provided in the BIDS format. Our results suggest that, regardless of whether classical machine learning or deep learning was used, the highest performance was reached by pipelines and architectures involving spatially aware representations of the M/EEG signals, leading to R^2 scores between 0.60-0.71. Hand-crafted features paired with random forest regression provided robust benchmarks even in situations in which other approaches failed. Taken together, this set of benchmarks, accompanied by open-source software and high-level Python scripts, can serve as a starting point and quantitative reference for future efforts at developing M/EEG-based measures of brain aging. The generality of the approach renders this benchmark reusable for other related objectives such as modeling specific cognitive variables or clinical endpoints.</p>",2021-12-16

A striking feature of this variant is the large number of spike mutations that pose a threat to the efficacy of current COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies. This concern is amplified by the findings from our study.  We found B.1.1.529 to be markedly resistant to neutralization by serum not only from convalescent patients, but also from individuals vaccinated with one of the four widely used COVID-19 vaccines. Even serum from persons vaccinated and boosted with mRNA-based vaccines exhibited substantially diminished neutralizing activity against B.1.1.529. By evaluating a panel of monoclonal antibodies to all known epitope clusters on the spike protein, we noted that the activity of 18 of the 19 antibodies tested were either abolished or impaired, including ones currently authorized or approved for use in patients. In addition, we also identified four new spike mutations (S371L, N440K, G446S, and Q493R) that confer greater antibody resistance to B.1.1.529.

The continued growth of multi-cohort genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and large-scale biobank projects has provided researchers with a wealth of GWAS summary statistics and individual-level data suitable for performing PRS analyses. However, as the size of these studies increase, the risk of inter-cohort sample overlap and close relatedness increases. Ideally sample overlap would be identified and removed directly, but this is typically not possible due to privacy laws or consent agreements.

We demonstrate that inter-cohort overlap results in a significant and often substantial inflation in the observed PRS-trait association, coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) and false-positive rate. This inflation can be high even when the absolute number of overlapping individuals is small if this makes up a notable fraction of the target sample.

Astrocytes are purported to play an active role in regulating DVC function and, by extension, physiological parameters. Previous work has demonstrated that DVC astrocytes directly sense hormones that regulate food intake and blood glucose and are critical for their effect. In addition, DVC astrocytes in ex vivo slices respond to low tissue glucose. The response of neurons, including catecholaminergic neurons, to low glucose is conditional on intact astrocyte signalling in slice preparations suggesting astrocytes are possibly the primary sensors of glucose deprivation (glucoprivation). Based on these findings we hypothesised that if DVC astrocytes act as glucoprivation sensors in vivo they would both show a response to systemic glucoprivation and drive physiological responses to restore blood glucose. We found that 2 hours of systemic glucoprivation induced neither FOS nor glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactivity in DVC astrocytes, specifically those in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Furthermore, we found that while chemogenetic activation of DVC astrocytes suppressed food intake by reducing both meal size and meal number, this manipulation also suppressed food intake under conditions of glucoprivation. Chemogenetic activation of DVC astrocytes did not increase basal blood glucose nor protect against insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. In male mice chemogenetic DVC astrocyte activation did not alter glucose tolerance, in female mice the initial glucose excursion was reduced, suggesting enhanced glucose absorption. Taken together this suggests that as a whole-population DVC astrocytes do not function as glucoprivation sensors in vivo in mice. Instead, we propose that DVC astrocytes play an indispensable, homeostatic role to maintain the function of glucoregulatory neuronal circuitry.</p>",2021-12-16

Central domain sequences from fission yeast centromeres are preferred substrates for CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> incorporation, but their use is context dependent, requiring adjacent heterochromatin. CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> overexpression bypasses heterochromatin dependency, suggesting heterochromatin ensures exposure to conditions or locations permissive for CENP-A<sup>Cnp1</sup> assembly.

These experiments typically involve selection acting on populations of communities, each of which is composed of multiple species. Numerical explorations allowed to link the evolutionary dynamics to the multiple parameters involved in this complex, multi-scale evolutionary process. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of artificial selection of communities is still lacking. Here, we propose a general model for the evolutionary dynamics of species-rich communities, each described by disordered generalized Lotka-Volterra equations, that we study analytically and by numerical simulations. Our results reveal that a generic response to selection for larger total community abundance is the emergence of an isolated eigenvalue of the interaction matrix that can be understood as an effective cross-feeding term. In this way, selection imprints a structure on the community, which results in a global increase of both the level of mutualism and the diversity of interactions. Our approach moreover allows to disentangle the role of intraspecific competition, interspecific interactions symmetry and number of selected communities in the evolutionary process, and can thus be used as a guidance in optimizing artificial selection protocols.</p>",2021-12-14

Despite its potential widespread relevance, documented examples of hypertranscription remain few and limited predominantly to early development. This limitation is in large part due to the fact that modern sequencing approaches, including single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), generally assume similar levels of transcriptional output per cell. Here, we use molecule counting and spike-in normalization to develop absolute scaling of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Absolute scaling enables an estimation of total transcript abundances per cell, which we validate in embryonic stem cell (ESC) and germline data and apply to adult mouse organs at steady-state or during regeneration. The results reveal a remarkable dynamic range in transcriptional output among adult cell types. We find that many different multipotent stem and progenitor cell populations are in a state of hypertranscription, including in the hematopoietic system, intestine and skin. Hypertranscription marks cells with multilineage potential in adult organs, is redeployed in conditions of tissue injury, and can precede by 1-2 days bursts of proliferation during regeneration. In addition to the association between hypertranscription and the stem/progenitor cell state, we dissect the relationship between transcriptional output and cell cycle, ploidy and secretory behavior. Our analyses reveal a common set of molecular pathways associated with hypertranscription across adult organs, including chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, ribosome biogenesis and translation. Our findings introduce an approach towards maximizing single-cell RNA-seq profiling. By applying this methodology across a diverse collection of cell states and contexts, we put forth hypertranscription as a general and dynamic cellular program that is pervasively employed during development, organ maintenance and regeneration.</p><sec><title>SUMMARY STATEMENT</title><p>Absolute scaling of single-cell transcriptomic data reveals highly dynamic global levels of transcription across adult cell lineages</p></sec>",2021-12-13

However, increasing evidence points to an underlying vulnerability to SVD-related brain damage, not just extrinsic factors. Here, in a novel normotensive transgenic rat model where the phospholipase flippase <italic>Atp11b</italic> is deleted, we show pathological, imaging and behavioural changes typical of those in human sporadic SVD, but that occur without hypertension. These changes are due to an intrinsic endothelial cell dysfunction, identified in vessels of the brain white matter and the retina, with pathological evidence of vasoreactivity and blood-brain barrier deficits, which precipitate a secondary maturation block in oligodendroglia and myelin disruption around the small vessels.

Recent studies have demonstrated that fungal effectors can be grouped into structural classes despite significant sequence variation.

Additional structural prediction and comparison indicate that 11 of the 14 SIX effectors group into four structural families. This revealed that genetically linked effectors are related structurally, and we provide direct evidence for a physical association between one divergently-transcribed effector pair.

Cellular mechanisms underlying AKI and kidney cell responses to injury remain incompletely understood. Methods: We performed single-nuclei transcriptomics, bulk transcriptomics, molecular imaging studies, and conventional histology on kidney tissues from 8 individuals with severe AKI (stage 2 or 3 according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria). Specimens were obtained within 1-2 hours after individuals had succumbed to critical illness associated with respiratory infections, with 4 of 8 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19. Control kidney tissues were obtained post-mortem or after nephrectomy from individuals without AKI. Results: High-depth single cell-resolved gene expression data of human kidneys affected by AKI revealed enrichment of novel injury-associated cell states within the major cell types of the tubular epithelium, in particular in proximal tubules, thick ascending limbs and distal convoluted tubules. Four distinct, hierarchically interconnected injured cell states were distinguishable and characterized by transcriptome patterns associated with oxidative stress, hypoxia, interferon response, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, respectively. Transcriptome differences between individuals with AKI were driven primarily by the cell type-specific abundance of these four injury subtypes rather than by private molecular responses. AKI-associated changes in gene expression between individuals with and without COVID-19 were similar. Conclusion: The study provides an extensive resource of the cell type-specific transcriptomic responses associated with critical illness-associated AKI in humans, highlighting recurrent disease-associated signatures and inter-individual heterogeneity. Personalized molecular disease assessment in human AKI may foster the development of tailored therapies.</p>",2021-12-16

Kelley'}]","<p>Convergent evolution, where independent lineages evolve similar traits when adapting to similar habitats, is a common phenomenon and testament to the repeatability of evolutionary processes. Still, non-convergence is also common, and a major question is whether apparently idiosyncratic, lineage-specific evolutionary changes are reflective of chance events inherent to evolutionary processes, or whether they are also influenced by deterministic genetic or ecological factors. To address this question, we quantified the degree of convergence in genome-wide patterns of gene expression across lineages of livebearing fishes (family Poeciliidae) that span 40 million years of evolution and have colonized extreme environments in the form of toxic, hydrogen-sulfide-rich springs. We specifically asked whether the degree of convergence across lineage pairs was related to their phylogenetic relatedness or the ecological similarity of the habitats they inhabit. Using phylogenetic comparative analyses, we showed that the degree of convergence was highly variable across lineage pairs residing in sulfide springs. While closely related lineages did not exhibit higher degrees of convergence than distantly related ones, we uncovered a strong relationship between degree of convergence and ecological similarity. Our results indicate that variation in the degree of convergence is not merely noise associated with evolutionary contingency. Rather, cryptic environmental variation that is frequently ignored when we employ reductionist approaches can significantly contribute to adaptive evolution. This study highlights the importance of multivariate approaches that capture the complexities of both selective regimes and organismal design when assessing the roles of determinism and contingency in evolution.</p><sec><title>Significance Statement</title><p>When different species adapt to similar environmental conditions, we frequently observe a mix between shared (convergent) and lineage-specific (nonconvergent) evolutionary changes.

However, it remains unclear whether lineage-specific changes are caused by random forces that limit the predictability of evolution, or whether they reflect deterministic processes shaped by unidentified genetic and environmental factors. By analyzing patterns of gene expression across fishes in extreme environments, we show that the degree of convergence between lineages is related to ecology, indicating that lineage-specific evolutionary changes are not just noise caused by random processes. Thus, acknowledging the complexity of nature in empirical research is critical if we want to predict evolution.</p></sec>",2021-12-14

A strategy to prevent secondary cone death could provide a generalized RP therapy to preserve daylight color vision regardless of the underlying mutation. In mouse models of RP, cones in the far peripheral retina survive long-term, despite complete rod loss. The mechanism for such peripheral cone survival had not been explored. Here, we found that active retinoic acid (RA) signaling in peripheral Muller glia is both sufficient and necessary for the extended cone survival. RA depletion by conditional knockout of RA synthesis enzymes, or overexpression of an RA degradation enzyme, abrogated peripheral cone survival. Conversely, constitutive activation of RA signaling in the central retina promoted long-term cone survival.

Mice can react to innately threatening stimuli in less than 250 milliseconds [1] and, in simple environments, use spatial memory to quickly escape to shelter [2,3]. Natural habitats, however, often offer multiple routes to safety which animals must rapidly identify and choose from to maximize the chances of survival [4]. This is challenging because while rodents can learn to navigate complex mazes to obtain rewards [5,6], learning the value of different routes through trial-and-error during escape from threat would likely be deadly. Here we have investigated how mice learn to choose between different escape routes to shelter. By using environments with paths to shelter of varying length and geometry we find that mice prefer options that minimize both path distance and path angle relative to the shelter. This choice strategy is already present during the first threat encounter and after only ~10 minutes of exploration in a novel environment, indicating that route selection does not require experience of escaping. Instead, an innate heuristic is used to assign threat survival value to alternative paths after rapidly learning the spatial environment. This route selection process is flexible and allows quick adaptation to arenas with dynamic geometries. Computational modelling of different classes of reinforcement learning agents shows that the observed behavior can be replicated by model-based agents acting in an environment where the shelter location is rewarding during exploration. These results show that mice combine fast spatial learning with innate heuristics to choose escape routes with the highest survival value. They further suggest that integrating priors acquired through evolution with knowledge learned from experience supports adaptation to changing environments while minimizing the need for trial-and-error when the errors are very costly.</p>",2021-12-15

We trained the models using large and diverse training data sets from a variety of forest types and biomes, consisting of 3288 canopy images (both canopy cover and hemispherical canopy closure photographs) and 1468 understory vegetation images. Overall classification accuracy of the models was high with a Dice score of 0.91 for the canopy model and 0.89 for the understory vegetation model (assessed with 821 and 367 images, respectively), indicating robustness to variation in input images and good generalization strength across forest types and biomes.

In this work, we evaluated the effect of acute and chronic physical activity on a new task to assess spatial pattern separation in a 3D virtual reality environment. We manipulated the load of memory similarity and found that 25 minutes of cycling after encoding - but not before retrieval - was sufficient to improve similar, but not dissimilar memories, 24 hours after encoding. Furthermore, we found that participants who engaged in regular physical activity, but not sedentary subjects, showed memory for the similar condition the next day. Thus, physical activity could be a simple way to improve discrimination of spatial memories in humans.</p>",2021-12-14

Multiple sets of lineages that are separately monophyletic are said to be reciprocally monophyletic, or jointly monophyletic. The prevalence of reciprocal monophyly, or joint monophyly, has been used to evaluate phylogenetic and phylogeographic hypotheses, as well as to delimit species. These applications often make use of a probability of joint monophyly under models of gene lineage evolution. Studies in coalescent theory have computed this joint monophyly probability for small numbers of separate groups in arbitrary species trees, and for arbitrary numbers of separate groups in trivial species trees. Here, generalizing existing results on monophyly probabilities under the multispecies coalescent, we derive the probability of joint monophyly for arbitrary numbers of separate groups in arbitrary species trees. We illustrate how our result collapses to previously examined cases. We also study the effect of tree height, sample size, and number of species on the probability of joint monophyly. The result also enables computation of relatively simple lower and upper bounds on the joint monophyly probability. Our results expand the scope of joint monophyly calculations beyond small numbers of species, subsuming past formulas that have been used in simpler cases.</p>",2021-12-17

Here we evaluate the potential effect of Omicron S mutations on S protein dynamics and ACE2 binding as contributing factors to infectivity as well as propensity for immune escape. We define a consensus set of mutations from 77 sequences assigned as Omicron in GISAID as of November 25. We create structural models of the Omicron S protein in the open and closed states, as part of a complex with ACE2 and for each of 77 complexes of S bound to different antibodies with known structures. We have previously utilized Dynamical Signatures (DS) and the Vibrational Entropy Score (VDS) to evaluate the propensity of S variants to favour the open state. Here, we introduce the Binding Influence Score (BIS) to evaluate the influence of mutations on binding affinity based on the net gain or loss of interactions within the protein-protein interface. BIS shows excellent correlation with experimental data (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87) on individual mutations in the ACE2 interface for the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron variants combined. On the one hand, the DS of Omicron highly favours a more rigid open state and a more flexible closed state with the largest VDS of all variants to date, suggesting a large increase in the chances to interact with ACE2. On the other hand, the BIS shows that apart from N501Y, all other mutations in the interface reduce ACE2 binding affinity. VDS and BIS show opposing effects on the overall effectiveness of Omicron mutations to promote binding to ACE2 and therefore initiate infection. To evaluate the propensity for immune escape we calculated the net change of favourable and unfavourable interactions within each S-antibody interface. The net change of interactions shows a positive score (a net increase of favourable interactions and decrease of unfavourable ones) for 41 out of 77 antibodies, a nil score for 15 and a negative score for 21 antibodies. Therefore, in only 28% of S-antibody complexes (21/77) we predict some level of immune escape due to a weakening of the interactions with Omicron S. Considering that most antibody epitopes and the mutations are within the S-ACE2 interface our results suggest that mutations within the RBD of Omicron may give rise to only partial immune escape, which comes at the expense of reduced ACE2 binding affinity. However, this reduced ACE2 affinity appears to have been offset by increasing the occupancy of the open state of the Spike protein.</p>",2021-12-15

We hypothesize that therapy-induced senescence and senescence progression via bystander effects is a significant cause of this premature ageing phenotype. Accordingly, the study addresses the question whether a short anti-senescence intervention is able to block progression of radiation-induced frailty and disability in a pre-clinical setting. Male mice were sub-lethally irradiated at 5 months of age and treated (or not) with either a senolytic drug (Navitoclax or dasatinib + quercetin) for 10 days or with the senostatic metformin for 10 weeks. Follow up was for one year. Treatments commencing within a month after irradiation effectively reduced frailty progression (p&lt;0.05) and improved muscle (p&lt;0.01) and liver (p&lt;0.05) function as well as short-term memory (p&lt;0.05) until advanced age with no need for repeated interventions. Senolytic interventions that started late, after radiation-induced premature frailty was manifest, still had beneficial effects on frailty (p&lt;0.05) and short-term memory (p&lt;0.05). Metformin was similarly effective as senolytics. At therapeutically achievable concentrations metformin acted as a senostatic neither via inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, nor via improvement of mitophagy or mitochondrial function, but by reducing non-mitochondrial ROS production via NOX4 inhibition in senescent cells. Our study suggests that the progression of adverse long-term health and quality-of-life effects of radiation exposure, as experienced by cancer survivors, might be rescued by short-term adjuvant antisenescence interventions.</p>",2021-12-16

Most Neodermatan viruses seem to co-diversify with their host, with the exception of rhabdoviruses which may switch host more often, based on phylogenetic relationships. Neodermatan rhabodviruses also have an ancestral position to vertebrate-associated viruses, including Lyssaviruses, suggesting that vertebrate rhabdoviruses emerged from a flatworm rhabdovirus in a parasitized host.

Studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have identified a diverse set of molting-associated factors including signaling molecules, intracellular trafficking regulators, ECM components, and ECM-modifying enzymes such as matrix metalloproteases. C. elegans NEKL-2 and NEKL-3, two conserved members of the NEK family of protein kinases, are essential for molting and promote the endocytosis of environmental steroid-hormone precursors by the epidermis. Steroids in turn drive the cyclic induction of many genes required for molting. Here we report a novel role for the sole C. elegans ADAM-meltrin metalloprotease family member, ADM-2, as a negative regulator of molting. Whereas loss of adm-2 led to strong suppression of molting defects in partial loss-of-function nekl mutants, overexpression of ADM-2 induced molting defects in wild-type animals. CRISPR genome editing implicated the Zn-binding motif within the metalloprotease domain as critical for mediating the effects of ADM-2 on molting. ADM-2 is expressed in the epidermis, and its trafficking through the endo-lysosomal network was disrupted after NEKL depletion. We also identified the epidermally expressed low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, LRP-1, as a candidate target of ADM-2 regulation. Whereas loss of ADM-2 activity led to the upregulation of LRP-1, ADM-2 overexpression caused a reduction in LRP-1 abundance, suggesting that ADM-2 may function as a sheddase for LRP-1. We propose that loss of adm-2 suppresses molting defects in nekl mutants by eliminating a negative regulator of LRP-1, thereby compensating for defects in the efficiency of LRP-1 and sterol uptake. Our findings emphasize the importance of endocytic trafficking for both the internalization of factors that promote molting and the removal of proteins that would otherwise be deleterious to the molting process.

Muscles have evolved a variety of ways to ensure sarcomere homogeneity, one example being the controlled oligomerization of Zasp proteins that sets the diameter of the myofibril. To understand how Zasp proteins effect myofibril growth, we looked for Zasp-binding proteins at the Z-disc. We found that the E1 subunit of the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex is recruited to the Z-disc by Zasp52 and is required to sustain myofibril growth.

One key factor contributing to AMR is the ability of bacteria to export drugs through efflux pumps, which relies on the ATP-dependent expression and interaction of several controlling genes. Recent studies have shown significant cell-to-cell ATP variability exists within clonal bacterial populations, but the contribution of intrinsic cell-to-cell ATP heterogeneity is generally overlooked in understanding efflux pumps. Here, we consider how ATP variability influences gene regulatory networks controlling expression of efflux pump genes in two bacterial species. We develop and apply a generalisable Boolean modelling framework, developed to incorporate the dependence of gene expression dynamics on available cellular energy supply. Theoretical results show differences in energy availability can cause pronounced downstream heterogeneity in efflux gene expression. Cells with higher energy availability have a superior response to stressors. Further, in the absence of stress, model bacteria develop heterogeneous pulses of efflux pump gene expression which contribute to a sustained sub-population of cells with increased efflux expression activity, potentially conferring a continuous pool of intrinsically resistant bacteria. This modelling approach thus reveals an important source of heterogeneity in cell responses to antimicrobials and sheds light on potentially targetable aspects of efflux pump-related antimicrobial resistance.</p>",2021-12-14

Here, we addressed the physiological relevance of the vegetative cell-specific Flv1A and Flv3A on the bioenergetic processes occurring in the diazotrophic Anabaena under variable CO2.

Nevertheless, Flv3A showed a more important role in photoprotection than Flv1A. Under low CO2 diazotrophic conditions, Flv3A is capable of mediating moderate O2 photoreduction, independently of Flv1A, but in coordination with Flv2 and Flv4. Strikingly, the lack of Flv3A resulted in strong downregulation of the heterocyst-specific uptake hydrogenase, which led to enhanced H2 photoproduction under both oxic and micro-oxic conditions.

There have been no population-based studies of SARS-CoV-2 testing, PCR-confirmed infections and COVID-19-related hospital admissions across the full paediatric age range. We examine the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in children and young people (CYP) aged &lt;23 years. 

Methods
We used a birth cohort of all children born in Scotland since 1997, constructed via linkage between vital statistics, hospital records and SARS-CoV-2 surveillance data. We calculated risks of tests and PCR-confirmed infections per 1000 CYP-years between August and December 2020, and COVID-19-related hospital admissions per 100,000 CYP-years between February and December 2020. We used Poisson and Cox proportional hazards regression models to determine risk factors.

Results
Among the 1226855 CYP in the cohort, there were 378402 tests, 19005 PCR confirmed infections and 346 admissions, corresponding to rates of 770.8/1000 (95% confidence interval 768.4-773.3), 179.4 (176.9-182.0) and 29.4/100,000 (26.3-32.8) CYP-years respectively. Infants had the highest COVID-19-related admission rates. Chronic conditions, particularly multiple types of conditions, was strongly associated with COVID-19-related admissions across all ages. The hazard ratio for &gt;1 chronic condition type was 12.2 (7.9-18.82) compared to children with no chronic conditions. 89% of admitted children had no chronic conditions recorded.

Conclusions
Infants, and CYP with chronic conditions are at highest risk of admission with COVID-19, however the majority of admitted CYP have no chronic conditions. These results provide evidence to support risk/benefit analyses for paediatric COVID-19 vaccination programmes. Studies examining whether maternal vaccine during pregnancy prevents COVID-19 admissions in infants are urgently needed.

This work identifies and analyses the main cell regulatory processes affected and induced by SARS-CoV-2, using transcriptomic data from several infectable cell lines available in public databases and in vivo samples. We propose a new class of statistical models to handle three major challenges, namely the scarcity of observations, the high dimensionality of the data, and the complexity of the interactions between genes. Additionally, we analyse the function of these genes and their interactions within cells to compare them to ones affected by IAV (H1N1), RSV and HPIV3 in the target cell lines. Results: Gathered results show that, although clustering and predictive algorithms aid classic functional enrichment analysis, recent pattern-based biclustering algorithms significantly improve the number and quality of the detected biological processes. Additionally, a comparative analysis of these processes is performed to identify potential pathophysiological characteristics of COVID-19.

Vaccinated hamsters challenged with homologous SARS-CoV2 variants exhibited complete protection from infection. In addition, vaccinated hamsters challenged with heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variants exhibited significantly reduced shedding of infectious virus.

Yet, analytical methods that can handle polymorphisms jointly with sequence divergence across species are rare and not easily accessible to empiricists. We implemented polymorphism-aware phylogenetic models (PoMos), an alternative approach for species tree estimation, in the Bayesian phylogenetic software RevBayes. PoMos naturally account for incomplete lineage sorting, which is known to cause difficulties for phylogenetic inference in species radiations, and scale well with genome-wide data. Simultaneously, PoMos can estimate mutation and selection biases. We have applied our methods to resolve the complex phylogenetic relationships of a young radiation of Chorthippus grasshoppers, based on coding sequences. In addition to establishing a well-supported species tree, we found a mutation bias favoring AT alleles and selection bias promoting the fixation of GC alleles, the latter consistent with GC-biased gene conversion. The selection bias is two orders of magnitude lower than genetic drift, validating the critical role of nearly neutral evolutionary processes in species radiation. PoMos offer a wide range of models to reconstruct phylogenies and can be easily combined with existing models in RevBayes - e.g., relaxed clock and divergence time estimation - offering new insights into the evolutionary processes underlying molecular evolution and, ultimately, species diversification.</p>",2021-12-16

Few <italic>Neisseria</italic> bacteriophages (phages) have been identified and their impact on bacterial physiology is poorly understood. Furthermore, little is known about the range of species that <italic>Neisseria</italic> phages can infect. In this study, we used three virus prediction tools to scan 248 genomes of 21 different <italic>Neisseria</italic> species and identified 1302 unique predicted prophages. Using comparative genomics, we found that many predictions are dissimilar from other prophages and MGEs previously described to infect <italic>Neisseria</italic> species. We also identified similar predicted prophages in genomes of different <italic>Neisseria</italic> species. Additionally, we examined CRISPR-Cas targeting of each <italic>Neisseria</italic> genome and predicted prophage. While CRISPR targeting of chromosomal DNA appears to be common among several <italic>Neisseria</italic> species, we found that 20% of the prophages we predicted are targeted significantly more than the rest of the bacterial genome in which they were identified (i.e., backbone). Furthermore, many predicted prophages are targeted by CRISPR spacers encoded by other species. We then used these results to infer additional host species of known <italic>Neisseria</italic> prophages and predictions that are highly targeted relative to the backbone. Together, our results suggest that we have identified novel <italic>Neisseria</italic> prophages, several of which may infect multiple <italic>Neisseria</italic> species.

Commensal <italic>Neisseria</italic> species are thought to serve as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes for the pathogenic species <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>. Therefore, it is important to understand both the diversity of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) that can mediate horizontal gene transfer within this genus, and the breadth of species these MGEs can infect. In particular, few bacteriophages (phages) have been identified and characterized in <italic>Neisseria</italic> species. In this study, we identified a large number of candidate phages integrated within the genomes of commensal and pathogenic <italic>Neisseria</italic> species, many of which appear to be novel phages. Importantly, we discovered extensive interspecies targeting of predicted phages by <italic>Neisseria</italic> CRISPR-Cas systems, which may reflect their movement between different species.

While the nucleus, a large and stiff organelle, impedes cell migration between non-deformable pillars in vitro, its function in vivo may vary depending on the microenvironment. Further, it is unknown how nuclei contribute to collective migration in vivo and whether nuclei in different positions within cell collectives experience different forces. Here, we use border cell migration in the fly ovary as an in vivo model to investigate the effects of confined, collective migration on nuclei and the contribution of nuclear lamins to migration. We found severe yet transient nuclear deformations occur, particularly in the leading cell, as border cells squeeze through tiny crevices between germline cells, termed nurse cells. Leading cells extend protrusions between nurse cells, which may pry open space to allow the cluster to advance. Here we report that the leading cell nuclei deformed as they moved into leading protrusions. Then as protrusions widened, the nucleus recovered a more circular shape. These data suggest that lead cell nuclei may help protrusions expand and thereby enlarge the migration path. To test how nuclei might promote or impede border cell migration, we investigated nuclear lamins, proteins that assemble into intermediate filaments and structurally support the nuclear envelope. Depletion of the Drosophila B-type lamin, Lam, from the outer, motile border cells, but not the inner, nonmotile polar cells, impeded border cell migration, whereas perturbations of the A-type lamin, LamC, did not. While wild type border cell clusters typically have one large leading protrusion as they delaminate from the anterior follicular epithelium, clusters depleted of B-type lamin had multiple, short-lived protrusions, resulting in unproductive cluster movement and failure to progress along the migration path. Further, border cell nuclei depleted of B-type lamins were small, formed blebs, and ruptured. Together, these data indicate that B-type lamin is requied for nuclear integrity, which in turn stabilizes the leading protrusion and promotes overall cluster polarization and collective movement through confined spaces.</p>",2021-12-17

However, how the PFC orchestrates context-dependent switch of strategies remains unclear. Here we show that pathway-specific projection neurons in the medial PFC (mPFC) differentially contribute to context-instructed strategy selection. In a decision-making task in which mice have been trained to flexibly switch between a previously established rule and a newly learned rule in a context-dependent manner, the activity of mPFC neurons projecting to the dorsomedial striatum encodes the contexts, and further represents decision strategies conforming to the old and new rules. Moreover, the activity of these neuron is required for context-instructed strategy selection. In contrast, the activity of mPFC neurons projecting to the ventral midline thalamus does not discriminate between the contexts, and represents the old rule even if mice have adopted the new one; furthermore, these neurons act to prevent the strategy switch under the new rule. Our results suggest that the mPFC→striatum pathway promotes flexible strategy selection guided by contexts, whereas the mPFC→thalamus pathway favors fixed strategy selection by preserving old rules.

We show that prefrontal population activity encodes predictive context and action plans in serially unfolding orthogonal subspaces, while prefrontal-motor theta oscillations synchronize action-encoding population subspaces to mediate the hand-off of action plans.

The TAC physically links the basal body of the flagellum with the kDNA spanning the two mitochondrial membranes. Here, we characterized p166 as the only TAC subunit that is anchored in the inner membrane. Its C-terminal transmembrane domain separates the protein into a large N-terminal region that interacts with the kDNA-localized TAC102 and a 34 aa C-tail that binds to the intermembrane space-exposed loop of the integral outer membrane protein TAC60. Thus, in contrast to the outer membrane TAC region which requires four essential subunits for proper function a single inner membrane TAC subunit is sufficient to bridge the distance from the OM to the kDNA. Surprisingly, non-functional p166 lacking the C-terminal 34 aa still localizes to the TAC region. This suggests the existence of nonessential TAC-associated proteins in the OM.

However, the impact of environmental context on maternal care and milk quality has not been thoroughly evaluated, nor are the biological underpinnings of EE on offspring development understood. Here, Sprague-Dawley rats were housed and bred in either EE or standard-housed (SD) conditions. Although EE dams gave birth to a larger number of pups, litters were standardized and cross-fostered across groups on postnatal day (P)1. Maternal milk samples were then collected on P1 (transitional milk phase) and P10 (mature milk phase) for analysis. While EE dams spent less time nursing, postnatal enrichment exposure was associated with heavier offspring bodyweights. Moreover, milk from EE dams had increased triglyceride levels compared to SD dams. Milk from EE mothers also contained a greater microbiome diversity and a significantly higher abundance of bacterial families related to bodyweight and energy metabolism. In addition to changes in lactational quality, we observed sex- and time-dependent effects of EE on offspring social behavior. Specifically, prenatal EE exposure was associated with greater sociability in females, while postnatal EE was associated with greater sociability in male offspring.

We identify a relationship between epigenetic state and the properties of chromosome structure fluctuation and validate this relationship through polymer simulations.

The relationship between degree of closure of the LA binding pocket of the RBD, and monomer burial in the trimer, is examined for a range of spike protein structures, including those with D614G mutation, and that of the Delta variant (which also carries D614G).  Some spike protein structures with this aspartic acid mutation show monomer packing approaching that of the locked form (at neutral pH, without LA binding) for two segments, a third (around the RBD) remains less closely packed.  Analysis of other coronavirus RBD structures suggests that mutation of the RBD in spike protein of the Omicron variant could lead to LA binding pocket changes.  It is proposed that these changes could lead to one of two consequences for the Omicron variant spike protein (which also has the D614G mutation), at neutral pH and without LA binding, either easier access to a locked form throughout that leads to cooperative transitions between all RBD down and all RBD up, or maintenance of a spike trimer with locked characteristics C-terminal to the RBD at the same time as the RBD is free to transit between down and up states.

Isolated VSMC area decreases following stimulation with the contractile agonists angiotensin II or carbachol. Importantly, the angiotensin II induced reduction in cell area correlated with increased traction stress generation. Inhibition of actomyosin activity using blebbistatin or Y-27632 prevented angiotensin II mediated changes in VSMC morphology, suggesting that changes in VSMC morphology and actomyosin activity are core components of the contractile response. Furthermore, we show that microtubule stability is an essential regulator of isolated VSMC contractility. Treatment with either colchicine or paclitaxel uncoupled the morphological and/or traction stress responses of angiotensin II stimulated VSMCs. Our findings support the tensegrity model and we demonstrate that microtubules act to balance the actomyosin-derived traction stress generation and regulate the morphological responses of VSMCs.</p>",2021-12-15

We find that the low-frequency spectrum - including the Delta, Theta, and Sigma frequency bands - drives the complexity changes during the sleep-wake states. This happens because low-frequency oscillations emerge from neuronal population patterns, as we show by recovering the complexity variations during the sleep-wake cycle from micro, meso, and macroscopic recordings. Moreover, we find that the lower frequencies reveal synchronisation patterns across the neocortex, such as a sensory-motor decoupling that happens during REM sleep. Overall, our works shows that EEG's low frequencies are critical in shaping the sleep-wake states' complexity across cortical scales.</p>",2021-12-17

First, the gene flow mixes alleles adapted to different environments, potentially hindering (swamping) adaptation. Second, it inflates genetic variance: this aids adaptation to spatially (and temporally) varying environments but if selection is hard, it lowers the mean fitness of the population. Third, neighbourhood size, which determines how weak genetic drift is, increases with dispersal -- when genetic drift is strong, increase of neighbourhood size with dispersal aids adaptation. In this note I focus on the role of dispersal in environments which change smoothly across space, and when local populations are quite small such that genetic drift has a significant effect. Using individual-based simulations, I show that in small populations, even leptokurtic dispersal benefits adaptation, by reducing the power of genetic drift. This has implications for management of small marginal populations: increased gene flow appears beneficial as long as adaptations involves a quantitative, rather than a discrete, trait. However, heavily leptokurtic dispersal will swamp continuous adaptation along steep environmental gradients so that only patches of locally adapted subpopulations remain.</p>",2021-12-16

Models of cognitive mapping in neuroscience mostly depict map-learning as a process of random or biased diffusion. In practice, however, animals explore spaces using structured, purposeful, sensory-guided actions. Here we test the hypothesis that executing specific exploratory actions is a key strategy for building a cognitive map. Previous work has shown that in arenas with obstacles and a shelter, mice spontaneously learn efficient multi-step escape routes by memorizing allocentric subgoal locations. We thus used threat-evoked escape to probe the relationship between ethological exploratory behavior and allocentric spatial memory. Using closed-loop neural manipulations to interrupt running movements during exploration, we found that blocking runs targeting an obstacle edge abolished subgoal learning. In contrast, blocking other movements while sparing edge-directed runs had no effect on memorizing subgoals. Finally, spatial analyses suggest that the decision to use a subgoal during escape takes into account the mouse's starting position relative to the layout of the environment. We conclude that mice use an action-driven learning process to identify subgoals and that these subgoals are then integrated into a map-based planning process. We suggest a conceptual framework for spatial learning that is compatible with the successor representation from reinforcement learning and sensorimotor enactivism from cognitive science.</p>",2021-12-16

Transdifferentiation to the luminal lineage does not normally occur but can be induced by DNA damage, luminal cell death or transplantation into a recipient mammary fat pad. Myoepithelial cells cultivated in vitro can also transdifferentiate towards the luminal lineage. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms and gene regulatory networks underlying this plasticity. Using a transgenic mouse (Tg11.5kb-GFP) that marks cap cells with GFP, we discovered that mature myoepithelial cells placed in culture begin to express GFP within ∼24 hrs and later express the Keratin 8 (K8) luminal marker. Cell tracking showed that most K8+ cells arose from GFP+ cells, suggesting that myoepithelial cells de-differentiate towards a progenitor state before changing lineage. Differential gene expression analysis, comparing pure GFP+ cap cells with mature myoepithelial cells, identified multiple transcription factors that iRegulon predicted might regulate the myoepithelial to cap cell transition. Knockout of one of these genes, Regulatory Factor 3 (Rfx3), significantly reduced the population of GFP+ cells and increased differentiation to the K8+ luminal lineage. Rfx3 knockout also reduced mammosphere growth and mammary gland regeneration efficiency in a transplantation assay, but had no effect on proliferation in vitro. Together, these data support a key role for Rfx3 in the stabilization of the mammary basal cell lineages.</p>",2021-12-13

The aim of this multinational study was to assess the development of adverse mental health symptoms among individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 in the general population by acute infection severity up to 16 months after diagnosis.
METHODS
Participants consisted of 247 249 individuals from seven cohorts across six countries (Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, Norway, Scotland, and Sweden) recruited from April 2020 through August 2021. We used multivariable Poisson regression to contrast symptom-prevalence of depression, anxiety, COVID-19 related distress, and poor sleep quality among individuals with and without a diagnosis of COVID-19 at entry to respective cohorts by time (0-16 months) from diagnosis. We also applied generalised estimating equations (GEE) analysis to test differences in repeated measures of mental health symptoms before and after COVID-19 diagnosis among individuals ever diagnosed with COVID-19 over time.
FINDINGS
A total of 9979 individuals (4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period and presented overall with a higher symptom burden of depression (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.18, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.03-1.36) and poorer sleep quality (1.13, 1.03-1.24) but not with higher levels of symptoms of anxiety or COVID-19 related distress compared with individuals without a COVID-19 diagnosis. While the prevalence of depression and COVID-19 related distress attenuated with time, the trajectories varied significantly by COVID-19 acute infection severity. Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 but never bedridden due to their illness were consistently at lower risks of depression and anxiety (PR 0.83, 95% CI 0.75-0.91 and 0.77, 0.63-0.94, respectively), while patients bedridden for more than 7 days were persistently at higher risks of symptoms of depression and anxiety (PR 1.61, 95% CI 1.27-2.05 and 1.43, 1.26-1.63, respectively) throughout the 16-month study period.
CONCLUSION
Acute infection severity is a key determinant of long-term mental morbidity among COVID-19 patients.</p>",2021-12-15

The approach, termed nano-cavity diffusional sizing (NDS), measures particle residence times within fluidic nano-cavities to determine their hydrodynamic radii. Using theoretical modelling and simulation, we show that the residence time of particles within nano-cavities above a critical timescale depends on the diffusion coefficient of the particle, which allows estimation of the particle’s size. We demonstrate this approach experimentally through measurement of particle residence times within nano-fluidic cavities using single-molecule confocal microscopy. Our data show that the residence times scale linearly with the sizes of nanoscale colloids, protein aggregates and single DNA oligonucleotides. NDS thus constitutes a new single molecule optofluidic approach that allows rapid and quantitative sizing of nanoscale objects for potential application in nanobiotechnology, biophysics, and clinical diagnostics.</p>",2021-12-13

Here, we proposed a novel algorithm to quantify disease relations based on a large accumulated microRNA-disease association dataset and then built a disease network that covered 15 disease classes and included 304 diseases. Analysis revealed a number of patterns for these diseases; for example, diseases tended to be clustered and coherent in the network. Surprisingly, we found that AAA showed the strongest similarity with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, both of which are autoimmune diseases, suggesting that AAA could be one type of autoimmune disease in etiology.

RTPSpy is a library package including 1) a fast, comprehensive, and flexible online fMRI denoising pipeline comparable to offline processing, 2) utilities for fast and accurate anatomical image processing to define a target region on-site, 3) a simulation system of online fMRI processing to optimize a pipeline and target signal calculation, 4) interface to an external application for feedback presentation, and 5) a boilerplate graphical user interface (GUI) integrating operations with RTPSpy library. Since online fMRI data processing cannot be equivalent to offline, we discussed the limitations of online analysis and their solutions in the RTPSpy implementation. We developed a fast and accurate anatomical image processing script with fast tissue segmentation (FastSeg), image alignment, and spatial normalization, utilizing the FastSurfer, AFNI, and ANTs. We confirmed that the FastSeg output was comparable with FreeSurfer, and could complete all the anatomical image processing in a few minutes. Thanks to its highly modular architecture, RTPSpy can easily be used for a simulation analysis to optimize a processing pipeline and target signal calculation. We present a sample script for building a real-time processing pipeline and running a simulation using RTPSpy. The library also offers a simple signal exchange mechanism with an external application. An external application can receive a real-time neurofeedback signal from RTPSpy in a background thread with a few lines of script. While the main components of the RTPSpy are the library modules, we also provide a GUI class for easy access to the RTPSpy functions. The boilerplate GUI application provided with the package allows users to develop a customized rtfMRI application with minimum scripting labor.

We believe that RTPSpy is an attractive option for developing rtfMRI applications highly optimized for individual purposes.

To accommodate the rising number of critically ill patients, new intensive care units were formed in several hospitals. Here we describe the clinical presentation, patient characteristics, treatments and outcomes of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients in a newly formed COVID-19 ICU at a tertiary cardiac center in Sofia, Bulgaria.  

Methods: This is a retrospective observational study of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients admitted to Sveta Ekaterina University Hospital in Sofia, Bulgaria, between November 4th, 2020 and January 6th, 2021. Data were collected from electronic and written patient records and charts. 

Results: We identified 38 critical care patients admitted with respiratory failure and treated with mechanical ventilation at our COVID-19 ICU during this period. The median age was 66 (IQR 57-76, range 27-89) and 74% were male. Most patients, 36 (95%), had at least one comorbidity. The most common comorbidities were hypertension, valvular heart disease, ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus. Overall, 27 (71%) patients had a concomitant cardiac disease other than hypertension and 24% were recent cardiac surgical patients. Inotropic support was required in 29 (76%) patients, renal replacement therapy in 12 (32%) patients and prone positioning and ECMO were used in 5 (13%) and 2 (5%) patients respectively. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 7.5 (IQR 5-14) days overall and 9 (IQR 6-13) days for survivors. At 30-days 28 (74%) of patients had died. Overall, 32 (84%) patients died in hospital and only 6 (16%) patients were discharged home. 

Conclusions: During the first major surge of COVID-19 cases in Bulgaria, despite the wave arriving later than in other countries, the healthcare system was largely unprepared. In our setting, mortality in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation was very high at 85%. There may be several factors contributing to these results, namely the predominance of cardiovascular comorbidities in our patient population, the strained ICU capacity and the lack of medical personnel to provide adequate intensive care to such complex patients.</p>",2021-12-17

The Aves are refractory to the infection, but chicks hatched from the T. cruzi inoculated eggs integrate the DNA minicircle sequences into the germ line cells. Rabbits, mice and chickens with the minicircle sequences mutations develop the Chagas cardiomyopathy and the DNA transfer underpins the heart disease.
Methodology: The PCR with the specific primer sets revealed the Protist nuclear DNA and the kinetoplast DNA in the agarose gels bands probed with the radiolabel specific sequences from tissues of the T. cruzi-infected rabbits and of the mice. A targetprimer TAIL-PCR amplification employing primer sets from the chickens, rabbits and mice, in combination with primer sets from the the T. cruzi kinetoplast minicircle sequences was used. This approach led us to disclose the integration sites of the kinetoplast DNA biomarker, then, used to monitor the effect of multidrug treatment of the T. cruzi infected mice.
Principal findings: The Southern hybridization, clone and sequence of the amplification products revealed the DNA minicircle sequences integrations sites in the LINE transposable elements. An array of inhibitors of eukaryote cells division was used to arrest the DNA transfer. It was shown that nine out of 12 inhibitors prevented the kinetoplast DNA integration into the macrophage genome. The multidrug treatment of the acutely T. cruzi-infected mice with Benznidazole, Azidothymidine and Ofloxacin lessened circa 2.5-fold the rate of the minicircle sequences integrations in the mouse genome and inhibited the rejection of the target heart cells.
Conclusion and significance: The T. cruzi mitochondrion kinetoplast minicircle sequences transfer driven pathogenesis of Chagas disease is an ancient Cross-Kingdom DNA phenomenon of evolution and, therefore, paradigm research with effective purposing inhibitors is needed.</p>",2021-12-17

During March–October 2021, 75,827 individuals were identified as having received heterologous vaccination, 9,489 invited to participate, 1,836 responded (19.3%) and 656 were eligible. In previously–uninfected adults, S–antibody GMC at 30 days post–second dose were lowest for ChAd–ChAd (862 (95%CI, 694– 1069)) and significantly higher for ChAd–BNT (6233 (5522– 7035); GMR 6.29; (5.04– 7.85); p&lt;0.001), BNT-ChAd (4776 (4066– 5610); GMR 4.55 (3.56– 5.81); p&lt;0.001) and BNT–BNT (5377 (4596– 6289); GMR 5.66 (4.49– 7.15); p&lt;0.001). By 12 weeks after dose two, S–antibody GMC had declined in all groups and remained significantly lower for ChAd–ChAd compared to ChAd–BNT (GMR 5.12 (3.79– 6.92); p&lt;0.001), BNT–ChAd (GMR 4.1 (2.96– 5.69); p&lt;0.001) and BNT–BNT (GMR 6.06 (4.32– 8.50); p&lt;0.001). Previously infected adults had higher S–antibody GMC compared to infection–naïve adults at all time–points and with all vaccine schedules.

In the last decade, the immune response effect of ICD has been shown, yet there is no tool that can induce controlled ICD with predictable results, regardless of the cell type. We designed a peptide-based tool, called [II], for controlled damage to cell membrane to induce ICD and DAMPs release. Herein we describe a series of experiments that determine that the mechanism of action of [II] includes a caspase-dependent ICD and subsequent release of immune stimulating DAMPs, on various cell types. Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that controlled DAMP release via [II] in vivo was associated with enhancement of antigen-specific adaptive immunity with influenza hemagglutinin (HA) subunit vaccine. HA and [II] showed significantly higher HA specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies, compared to HA-only immunized mice, while the peptide itself did not elicit antibodies. In this paper, we demonstrate the first peptide-aggregation induced immunogenic rupture (PAIIR) approach as vaccine adjuvants for increasing both humoral and cellular immunity.

Current regeneration therapies require two-dimensional (2D) cell expansion processes to achieve large cell populations critical for the repair of damaged (e.g. connective and musculoskeletal) tissues. However, the influence of mechanical memory on cell fate following expansion is unknown, and mechanisms defining how physical environments influence the therapeutic potential of cells remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the organization of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and expression of tissue-identifying genes in primary cartilage cells (chondrocytes) transferred to three-dimensional (3D) hydrogels depends on the number of previous population doublings on tissue culture plastic during 2D cell expansion. Decreased levels of H3K9me3 occupying promoters of dedifferentiation genes after the 2D culture were also retained in 3D culture. Suppression of H3K9me3 during expansion of cells isolated from a murine model similarly resulted in the loss of the chondrocyte phenotype and global remodeling of nuclear architecture. In contrast, increasing levels of H3K9me3 through inhibiting H3K9 demethylases partially rescued the chondrogenic nuclear architecture and gene expression, which has important implications for tissue repair therapies, where expansion of large numbers of phenotypically-suitable cells is required. Overall, our findings indicate mechanical memory in primary cells is encoded in the chromatin architecture, which impacts cell fate and the phenotype of expanded cells.</p>",2021-12-16

Extensive experiments on single cell RNA sequencing data sets confirm the usefulness of path metrics for dimension reduction and clustering. Distances between cells are measured in a data- driven way which is both density sensitive (decreasing distances across high density regions) and respects the underlying data geometry. By combining path metrics with multidimensional scaling, a low dimensional embedding of the data is obtained which respects both the global geometry of the data and preserves cluster structure.

We developed an ex vivo model with human airway epithelial (HAE) cells harvested from lung biopsies to study Spn colonisation and translocation. Flow-cytometry, confocal imaging and electron microscopy studies identified the epithelial lineage with signs of differentiation (beating cilia, mucus, and tight junctions). HAE cells were challenged with Spn wild-type TIGR4 (wtSpn) or its isogenic ΔcomC quorum sensing-deficient mutant. ΔcomC mutant colonised significantly less than wtSpn at 6 h post-inoculation but at significantly higher levels at 19 h and 30 h. Translocation correlated inversely with colonisation density. Transepithelial electric resistance (TEER) decreased after pneumococcal infection and correlated with increased translocation for both strains.
Confocal imaging illustrated colocalisation of intracellular Spn with both cilia and zonulin-1 and prominent microcolony formation with wtSpn but disintegration of microcolony structures over time with ΔcomC mutant. ΔcomC caused a more pronounced release of both zonulin-1 and lactate dehydrogenase into the supernatant at later time points than wtSpn, suggesting that cytotoxicity is likely not the mechanism leading to translocation. There was a density- and time-dependent increase of inflammatory cytokines from human HAE cells infected with ΔcomC compared with wtSpn, including increased levels of the NLRP3 inflammasome-related IL-18. 
In conclusion, our experiments indicate that ComC system allows a higher organisational level of population structure resulting in microcolony formation, increased early colonisation and subsequent translocation. We propose that ComC inactivation unleashes a very different and possibly more virulent phenotype that merits further investigation.</p>",2021-12-17

While distinct patterns of activity have been linked to synaptic plasticity, their impact on immediate early gene (IEG) expression remains poorly understood. The activity regulated cytoskeleton associated (Arc) gene has received wide attention as an IEG implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory. Yet, to date, the transcriptional dynamics of Arc in response to compartment and input-specific activity is unclear. By developing a knock-in mouse to fluorescently tag Arc alleles, we studied real-time transcription dynamics after stimulation of dentate granule cells (GCs) in acute hippocampal slices. To our surprise, we found that Arc transcription displayed distinct temporal kinetics depending on the activation of excitatory inputs that convey functionally distinct information, i.e. medial and lateral perforant paths (MPP and LPP, respectively). Moreover, the transcriptional dynamics of Arc after synaptic stimulation was similar to direct activation of GCs, although the contribution of ionotropic glutamate receptors, L-type voltage gated calcium channel, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) differed. Specifically, we observed an ER-mediated synapse-to-nucleus signal that supported elevations in nuclear calcium, and rapid induction of Arc transcription following MPP stimulation. However, activation of LPP inputs displayed lower nuclear calcium rise, which could underlie the delayed transcriptional onset of Arc. Our findings highlight how input-specific activity distinctly impacts transcriptional dynamics of an IEG linked to learning and memory.</p>",2021-12-17

Consequently, the average age of a case increased by 1 to 5 months, most markedly if there was strong immunity acquisition from previous exposure. If immunity to infection was largely determined by age rather than previous exposure, the 2021/22 season started earlier and lasted longer but with a peak incidence lower or similar to pre-pandemic levels.

We used pictures of artificial caterpillars with or without various predation marks, in an online survey that was targeted for the participants of the project, to evaluate the reliability of predation marks identification made by non-scientists and by scientists with and without previous experience in predation mark identification. Pictures of artificial caterpillars displayed typical marks left by birds, mammals and arthropods, as well as non-predation marks (‘false positive’). 357 respondents scanned 7140 pictures of these pictures. Self-declared scientists were more confident and accurate in their observations than non-scientists, but the differences in correct identifications among scientists and non-scientists were low. Self-declared scientists with previous experience were also more accurate than scientists without previous experience, while there were no differences in self-confidence among scientists with and without previous experience. Accuracy in predation mark identification did not differ among types of predators, but respondents were more keen to identify marks left by birds or mammals than arthropods.

To address this gap, we examined whether differential gene expression responses occur in forebrain-lineage neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) generated from three individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and three healthy controls. Following acute (24 hour) treatment with either interferon-gamma (IFNγ; 25 ng/μl) or interleukin (IL)-1β (10 ng/μl), we identified, by RNA sequencing, 3380 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the IFNγ-treated control lines (compared to untreated controls), and 1980 DEGs in IFNγ-treated SZ lines (compared to untreated SZ lines). Of these, 359 genes responded differently to IFNγ treatment in SZ relative to control lines, which were enriched for genes differentially expressed in adult SZ cases and in pathways related to the regulation of antigen processing, neuronal post-synaptic density, and the presynapse. There were no differentially expressed genes in the IL-1β-treatment conditions after Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Gene set enrichment analysis however showed that IL-1β impacts immune function and neuronal differentiation. Collectively, our data suggest that a) SZ NPCs show an attenuated transcriptional response to IFNγ treatment compared to control NPCs; b) IL-1β may be less relevant to NPC cultures than IFNγ and c) the genes differentially regulated in schizophrenia lines are primarily mitochondrial, loss-of-function, pre- and post-synaptic genes. Our findings particularly highlight early synaptic development as a key target for future research into the mechanisms of association between maternal immune activation and schizophrenia risk.</p>",2021-12-16

While prior studies have shown that attention enhances visual responses, we lack a cohesive understanding of how selective attention modulates visual representations across the brain. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants performed a selective attention task on superimposed stimuli from multiple categories and used a data-driven approach to test how attention affects both decodability of category information and residual correlations (after regressing out stimulus-driven variance) with category-selective regions of ventral temporal cortex (VTC). Our data reveal three main findings. First, when two objects are simultaneously viewed, the category of the attended object can be decoded more readily than the category of the ignored object, with the greatest attentional enhancements observed in occipital and temporal lobes. Second, after accounting for the response to the stimulus, the correlation in the residual brain activity between a cortical region and a category-selective region of VTC was elevated when that region's preferred category was attended vs. ignored, and more so in the right occipital, parietal, and frontal cortices. Third, we found that the stronger the residual correlations between a given region of cortex and VTC, the better visual category information could be decoded from that region. These findings suggest that heightened residual correlations by selective attention may reflect the sharing of information between sensory regions and higher-order cortical regions to provide attentional enhancement of goal-relevant information.</p>",2021-12-16

However, the potential of using nails to this end has not yet been explored. Their inherent resistance to decay and ease of sampling would offer an advantage in cases where post-mortem degradation poses challenges concerning sample collection and DNA-extraction. In the current study, clippings from both fingernails and toenails were collected from 108 living test subjects (age range: 0 – 96 years). The methylation status of 15 CpGs located in 4 previously established age-related markers (ASPA, EDARADD, PDE4C, ELOVL2) was investigated through pyrosequencing of bisulphite converted DNA. Significant dissimilarities in methylation levels were observed between all four limbs, hence limb-specific age prediction models were developed using ordinary least squares, weighted least squares and quantile regression analysis. When applied to their respective test sets, these models yielded a mean absolute deviation between predicted and chronological age ranging from 6.71 to 8.48 years. In addition, the assay was tested on methylation data derived from 5 nail samples collected from deceased individuals, demonstrating its feasibility for application in post-mortem cases. In conclusion, this study provides the first proof that chronological age can be assessed through DNA methylation patterns in nails.</p>",2021-12-16

Although understudied, the urban environment impacts the conditions of their nesting sites. Recent observations in the Brussels-Capital Region (Belgium) showed that urban pavements can be a novel nesting opportunity for Hymenoptera ground-nesting species such as wild bees and apoid wasps. Here, using citizen science, we investigated the richness of ground-nesting species living under urban pavements, the preferences of the sidewalk joint size related to ground-nesting species size and for sidewalk type or for soils texture under the pavements on the nesting site selection. A total of 22 species belonging to 10 Hymenoptera families of wild bees and digger wasps with their associated kleptoparasites were identified on 89 sites in Brussels. Sandstone setts or concrete slabs with an unbound joint size around 1 cm were found to be best suitable urban pavements for the ground-nesting species. The soil texture under the pavement was highly sandy among our samples. Finally, we also suggest engineering management guidelines to support bee and wasp species nesting under urban pavement in highly urbanized areas.

A total of 19 non repeated pus/wound swab samples from different anatomic locations and 17 samples that were previously identified as S. aureus and preserved in the labs were included in the study. The Staphylococcus aureus was identified on the basis of colony morphology, Gram's stain, biochemical tests (catalase and coagulase tests) and molecular identification through PCR amplification. Methodology: A total of 26 samples were recovered out of the 31 samples. Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility test was used to determine the sensitivity or resistance of S. aureus to methicillin. Out of the 26 strains, 4 were highly resistant, 10 were moderately resistant and 12 strains were sensitive. Three different protocols (Tube Method, Congo Red Agar Method and Tissue Culture plate method) were used for the detection of biofilm formation for both resistant and sensitive strains. Result: Comparative analysis of the antibiotic susceptibility and biofilm formation by different protocols showed that 70% strains that are resistant to antibiotic methicillin produced moderate-strong biofilms. 50% have produced the moderate-strong biofilms in all 3 protocols. In case of sensitive, 50% strains had produced none-weak biofilms in all 3 protocols. Decisions: The strains that had zone of inhibition of close to resistance produced weak-strong biofilms but they all produced weak biofilms in CRA method. It can be concluded that the strains of S. aureus that have the ability to produce biofilms become methicillin resistant.

Analog-to-digital transduction and digital signal transmission call for distinct spike initiation properties (filters) and those filters should, therefore, differ between the AIS and distal axon. Here we show that unlike the AIS, which spikes repetitively during sustained depolarization, the axon spikes transiently and only if depolarization reaches threshold before K<sub>V</sub>1 channels activate. Rate of depolarization is critical. This was shown by optogenetically evoking spikes in the distal axon of CA1 pyramidal neurons using different photostimulus waveforms and pharmacological conditions while recording antidromically propagated spikes at the soma, thus circumventing the prohibitive difficulty of patching intact axons. Computational modeling shows that K<sub>V</sub>1 channels in the axon implement a high-pass filter that is matched to the axial current waveform associated with spike propagation, thus maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio to ensure high-fidelity transmission of spike-based signals.</p>",2021-12-14

In ciliates, the electric field influences the electrophysiology and thus the cilia beat dynamics. This leads to a change of the swimming direction towards the cathode. The dynamical response to electric fields of Coleps hirtus has not been studied since the observations of Verworn in 1890 (1). While galvanotaxis has been studied in other cilitates, C. hirtus exhibit properties not found elsewhere, such as biomineralization-processes of alveolar plates with impact on the intracellular calcium regulation and a bimodal resting membrane potential, which leads unique electrophysiological driven bimodal swimming dynamics. Here, we statistically analyze the galvanotactic dynamics of C. hirtus by automated cell tracking routines. We found that the number of cells that show a galvanotactic response, increases with the increase of the applied electric field strength with a mean at about 2.1 V/cm. The spatiotemporal swimming dynamics change and lead to a statistical increase of linear elongated cell trajectories that point toward the cathode. Further, the increase of the electric fields decreases the mean velocity variance for electric fields larger than about 1.3 V/cm, while showing no significant change in the absolute velocity for any applied electric field. Fully functional galvanotactic responses were observed at a minimum extracellular calcium concentration of 20 μM. The results add important insights to the current understanding of cellular dynamics of ciliates and suggest that the currently accepted model lags the inclusion of the swimming dynamics and the complex calcium regulatory system of the cell. The results of this study do not only extend the fundamental understanding of C. hirtus dynamics, but also open possibilities for technical applications, such as biosensors or microrobots in the future.</p>",2021-12-17

Some microbes synthesize these fundamental ingredients of life <italic>de novo</italic>, while others rely on uptake to fulfill their metabolic needs. Although certain metabolic processes are inherently ’leaky’, the mechanisms enabling stable metabolite provisioning among microbes in the absence of a host remain largely unclear. In particular, how can metabolite provisioning among free-living bacteria be maintained under the evolutionary pressure to economize resources?

To gain insight into the molecular nature of IN-gRNA interactions, we have isolated compensatory substitutions in the background of a class II IN (R269A/K273A) variant that directly inhibits IN binding to the gRNA. We found that additional D256N and D270N substitutions in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of IN restored its ability to bind gRNA and led to the formation of infectious particles with correctly matured morphology. Furthermore, reinstating the overall positive electrostatic potential of the CTD through individual D256R or D256K substitutions was sufficient to restore IN-RNA binding and infectivity for the R269A/K273A as well as the R262A/R263A class II IN mutants. The compensatory mutations did not impact functional IN oligomerization, suggesting that they directly contributed to IN binding to the gRNA. Interestingly, HIV-1 IN R269A/K273A, but not IN R262A/R263A, bearing compensatory mutations was more sensitive to ALLINIs providing key genetic evidence that specific IN residues required for RNA binding also influence ALLINI activity.

Further investigation in translationally-blocked (TB), non-growing cells showed that Mn supplementation (20 μM) led to approximately 1.5X faster acidification compared to Mn-free conditions.

Conversely, without manganese, non-growing cells persisted to acidify for weeks, albeit at a reduced rate, but maintaining redox balance and culturability. Strikingly, despite being unculturable, α-keto acid-derived aldehydes continued to accumulate in cells incubated in the presence of manganese, whereas without manganese cells predominantly formed the corresponding alcohols. This is most likely reflecting NADH availability for the alcohol dehydrogenase-catalyzed conversion.

Two amino acid substitutions, N462D in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and A168T in the glycoprotein precursor GPC, were identified in the mutant.

In this evolutionary paradigm, bacteria are maintained in an energy-restricted environment in the growth phase called as long-term stationary phase or LTSP. This phase is characterized by a stable viable population size and highly dynamic genetic changes. Multiple independent iterations of LTSP evolution experiments have given rise to mutants that are slow-growing compared to the ancestor.

This study sought to explore the representation of TFs across a taxonomically-diverse range of fungi, with a focus on plant pathogens. A significant trend was observed among the obligate, host-associated pathogens, which possess a reduced overall TF repertoire, alluding to a lack of pressure for maintaining diversity.

Comparative analyses identified increased species-specific networks that are functionally associated to traits of cichlid phenotypic diversity. The evolutionary rewiring is associated with differential models of transcription factor (TF) and miRNA binding site turnover, driven by a high proportion of fast-evolving polymorphic sites in adaptive trait genes compared to subsets of random genes. Positive selection acting upon discrete mutations in these regulatory regions is likely to be an important mechanism in rewiring GRNs in rapidly radiating cichlids. Regulatory variants of functionally associated TF and miRNA binding sites of visual opsin genes differentially segregate according to phylogeny and ecology of Lake Malawi species, identifying both rewired e.g. clade-specific and conserved network motifs of adaptive trait associated GRNs.

It remains elusive whether additional mechanical inputs are required for folding mediated by apical constriction.

We found that depletion of the basolateral determinant, Dlg1, disrupts the transition between apical constriction and invagination without affecting the rate of apical constriction. Strikingly, the observed delay in invagination is associated with ineffective apical myosin contractions in the flanking cells that lead to overstretching of their apical domain. The defects in the flanking cells impede ventral-directed movement of the lateral ectoderm, suggesting reduced mechanical coupling between tissues. Specifically disrupting the flanking cells in wildtype embryos by laser ablation or optogenetic depletion of cortical actin is sufficient to delay the apical constriction-to-invagination transition. Our findings indicate that effective mesoderm invagination requires intact flanking cells and suggest a role for tissue-scale mechanical coupling during epithelial folding.</p>",2021-12-16

The mutation disrupts a C2H2 zinc finger motif in the OBV protein, resulting in the absence of BSEs in leaves and here we show that this and other pleiotropic effects, including changes in leaf insertion angle, leaf margin serration, minor vein density and fruit shape, are controlled by OBV via changes in auxin signalling. Loss of function of the transcriptional regulator AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF4) also results in defective BSE development, revealing an additional component of a novel genetic module controlling aspects of leaf development important for ecological adaptation and subject to breeding selections.</p>",2021-12-17

For instance, the muscle identification had been performed based only on their attachments and thus, muscle descriptions are often inconsistent among the studies. These classic studies often do not include figures or photographs, so the discrepancies in the descriptions of the muscles could only be verified by performing the muscle identification again with a more reliable method. This problem can be solved by performing muscle identification by innervation. This method, which focuses on the ontogenic origin of the muscle as opposed to the attachment site, is prone to individual and interspecies variation and is a common technique in recent anatomical research. This technique is more reliable than previous methods and is suitable for comparison with other taxa (i.e., eutherians).

While the broad trends and patterns of the cIFR estimates are more robust, we show that their levels are uncertain and sensitive to input data and modeling choices. In consequence, increased efforts at collecting high-quality data are essential for accurately estimating the cIFR, which is a key indicator for better understanding the health and mortality consequences of this pandemic.</p>",2021-12-17

We find that the 3D genome organization is remodeled and correlated with gene expressional change. The bulk remodeling effect of cross-boundary SVs in the 3D genome partly depends on intercellular genomic heterogeneity. Meanwhile, contact domains tend to minimize these disrupting effects of SVs within local adjacent genomic regions to maintain overall stability of 3D genome organization. Moreover, our data also demonstrates complex genomic rearrangements involving two key driver genes CDKN2A and SMAD4, and elucidates their influence on cancer-related gene expression from both linear view and 3D perspective.

Based on a detailed analysis of vocal and arousal dynamics in marmosets, we put forth a general model incorporating arousal and auditory-feedback loops for spontaneous vocal production. Using this model, we show that a stable oscillation can emerge as the baseline arousal increases, predicting the transition from stochastic to periodic oscillations occurring in marmoset vocal development. We further provide a solution for how this model can explain vocal development as the joint consequence of energetic growth and social feedback. Together, our model offers a plausible mechanism for the development of arousal-mediated adaptive behavior.</p>",2021-12-14

After confirming the importance of ICP0 in HSV-1 neuronal replication using an ICP0-null virus, we identified many ICP0-interacting proteins in infected neuronal and non-neuronal cells by mass-spectrometry-based interactome analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation assays validated ICP0 interactions with ACOT8, C1QBP, OTUD4, SNX9 and VIM in both Neuro-2a and 293T cells.

Male and female PSEN2 KO and age- and sex-matched wild-type (WT) mice were sham or corneal kindled beginning at 6-months-old. Kindled and sham-kindled mice were then challenged up to 6 weeks later in a battery of cognitive tests: non-habituated open field (OF), T-maze spontaneous alternation (TM), and Barnes maze (BM), followed by immunohistochemistry for markers of neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity. PSEN2 KO mice required significantly more stimulations to kindle (males: p&lt;0.02; females: p&lt;0.02). Chronic seizures more significantly worsened anxiety-like behaviors of female PSEN2 KO mice as measured by percentage of total time exploring the center of an OF. TM performance was significantly worsened in kindled female (p=0.024), but not male, PSEN2 KO mice. Male BM performance was generally worsened by seizures (p=0.038), but not by genotype. Conversely, kindled PSEN2 KO females made the most BM errors (p=0.007). Chronic seizures also significantly altered expression of hippocampal neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity markers in a sex-specific manner.

Here, we use an extended SEIR for SARS-COV-2 transmission sequentially calibrated to data on cases and interventions implemented in the state of Florida to explore how these factors may interact to govern potential pandemic futures. Our data-driven forecasts indicate while the introduction of vaccinations could lead to the permanent, albeit drawn-out, ending of the pandemic if the immunity generated through vaccinations and natural infections acts over the long-term, additional futures could become possible if this immunity wanes over time. These futures will be marked by repeated waves of infection, the amplitude and periodicity of which will depend on the duration over which the immunity generated in a population will operate.

The mechanism of hypoxia-induced podocyte injury vis-a-vis glomerulosclerosis has remained enigmatic. Hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) that transduces hypoxic adaptations, induces Transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a calcium dependent enzyme that catalyzes intramolecular ε-(γ-glutamyl) lysine cross-links of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of regulation of TG2 by HIF1α. Stabilization of HIF1α by FG4592 (Roxadustat) and physiological hypoxia, resulted in elevated expression of ZEB2 (zinc-finger E-box-homeobox 2) and its downstream target TRPC6 (transient receptor potential channel 6). ZEB2 transcriptionally activates TG2 expression, whereas, via TRPC6, it induces calcium influx, inturn it increases the TG2 activity. Blocking the TRPC6 action or suppressing its expression only partially attenuated FG4592 induced TG2 activity, whereas suppression of ZEB2 expression significantly abolished TG2 activity. This study demonstrates that stabilization of HIF1α stimulates both TG2 expression and activity, whereas abrogation of HIF1α by metformin prevented HIF1α regulated TG2 and consequent glomerular injury.</p>",2021-12-15

We have previously shown that in syntrophic cocultures of Clostridium acetobutylicum and Clostridium ljungdahlii, the two organisms undergo heterologous cell fusion, which includes fusion of the peptidoglycan cell walls and membranes. Heterologous cell fusion facilitated a large-scale exchange of cytoplasmic protein and RNA between the two organisms, leading to the formation of hybrid bacterial cells containing cytoplasmic material of the two parent organisms. Here we present new evidence that cell fusion events also facilitate the exchange of plasmid DNA between the two organisms of the syntrophic coculture. Through the use of a selective subculturing process, we successfully isolated wild-type C. acetobutylicum clones which have acquired a portion of the plasmid DNA, containing the antibiotic resistance marker, from a recombinant strain of C. ljungdahlii. Fusion events led to formation of persistent aberrant hybrid cells with distinct morphogenetic characteristics. Furthermore, our data support the concept of a novel, interspecies, mechanism of acquiring antibiotic resistance. Since neither organism contains any known conjugation machinery or mechanism, these findings expand our understanding of multi-species microbiomes, their survival strategies, and evolution.</p>",2021-12-16

However, we show here that experimental noises result in MRT and RFD profiles containing information at different spatial frequencies. We further demonstrate that one can compute an origin density landscape that, when inserted in an appropriate simulation framework, jointly predicts experimental MRT and RFD profiles with an unprecedented precision. We also extract an analytical formula linking intrinsic origin efficiency with observed origin efficiency and MRT. We then compare the computed origin density landscape with experimental distributions of potential origins (ORC, MCM) or actual initiation events (Bubble-seq, SNS-seq, OK-seq). The results indicate that MRT and RFD data are highly consistent with each other, that our simple model suffices to capture the replication dynamics during S phase given an appropriate initiation probability landscape, but that the density of potential origins is not the sole determinant of this landscape.</p>",2021-12-15

Despite this common principle, genes essential for mitosis are variable among organisms. This indicates that the loss of essential genes or bypass-of-essentiality (BOE) occurred multiple times during evolution. While many BOE relationships have been recently revealed experimentally, the BOE of mitosis regulators (BOE-M) has been scarcely reported and how this occurs remains largely unknown. Here, by mutagenesis and subsequent evolutionary repair experiments, we isolated viable fission yeast strains that lacked the entire coding region of Polo-like kinase (Plk), a versatile essential mitotic kinase. The BOE of Plk was enabled by specific mutations in the downstream machinery, including the MT-nucleating gamma-tubulin complex, and more surprisingly, through downregulation of glucose uptake, which is not readily connected to mitosis. The latter bypass was dependent on casein kinase I (CK1), which has not been considered as a major mitotic regulator. Our genetic and phenotypic data suggest that CK1 constitutes an alternative mechanism of MT nucleation, which is normally dominated by Plk. A similar relationship was observed in a human colon cancer cell line. Thus, our study shows that BOE-M can be achieved by simple genetic or environmental changes, consistent with the occurrence of BOE-M during evolution. Furthermore, the identification of BOE-M constitutes a powerful means to uncover a hitherto under-studied mechanism driving mitosis and also hints at the limitations and solutions for selecting chemotherapeutic compounds targeting mitosis.</p>",2021-12-16

Consequently, sMAC has been proposed as a biomarker, but it remains unclear when and how it is formed during infections.

Surprisingly, C5 was converted into C5b more potently by MAC-resistant compared to MAC-sensitive <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains. Both the increase in C5 conversion and sMAC generation were linked to the expression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-Antigen in the bacterial outer membrane.

Release of MAC precursors from bacteria induced lysis of bystander human erythrocytes in the absence of other serum components. However, serum regulators vitronectin (Vn) and clusterin (Clu) can prevent this bystander lysis. Combining size exclusion chromatography with mass spectrometry profiling, we show that sMAC released from bacteria in serum is a heterogeneous mixture of complexes composed of C5b-8, up to 3 copies of C9 and multiple copies of Vn and Clu.

Our results provide key evidence for taxa-specific responses and that temperature variability in addition to mean temperature may be a primary driver of PGD. Additionally, we found some positive influence of precipitation, productivity, and elevation on PGD; identified trends were dependent on the metric of PGD. In contrast to the classic negative relationship between species diversity and latitude, we report either a positive or taxa-dependent relationship between PGD and latitude, depending on the metric of PGD. The inconsistent latitudinal gradient in different metrics of PGD may be due to opposing processes diminishing patterns across latitudes that operate on different timescales, as well as the flattening of large-scale genetic gradients when assessing across species versus within species.

On this regard, researchers may ignore the lack of normality, transform the phenotypes, use generalized linear models, or use supervised learning algorithms and classification models with no restriction on the distribution of response variables, which are less sensitive when modeling ordinal scores. The goal of this research was to compare classification and regression genomic selection models for skewed phenotypes using stripe rust SEV and IT in winter wheat. We extensively compared both regression and classification prediction models using two training populations composed of breeding lines phenotyped in four years (2016-2018, and 2020) and a diversity panel phenotyped in four years (2013-2016). The prediction models used 19,861 genotyping-by-sequencing single-nucleotide polymorphism markers.

Here we demonstrate that CD enhances sensory responses in postsynaptic granular cells of the electrosensory lobe, but is not required for reading out EA input. Instead, diverse latency and spike count tuning across the EA population gives rise to graded information about stimulus amplitude that can be read out by standard integration of converging excitatory synaptic inputs.

As such, the impact from a longer timeframe of exposure on the gut microbiota is not known and interindividual variability in microbiome response needs to be measured. To answer these research questions, in this study the faecal microbiota from two individuals, previously selected for high and low emulsifier sensitivity, were exposed to two concentrations of soy lecithin during a 7 day treatment phase in the dynamic mucosal simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (M-SHIME). The results showed mild effects from soy lecithin on the composition and functionality of these microbial communities, which depended on the original microbial composition. The effects also mostly levelled off after 3 days of exposure. The emulsifier sensitivity for which the microbiota were selected, was preserved. Some potentially concerning effects were also registered: butyrate levels, positively correlating with Faecalibacterium abundance, were lowered by soy lecithin. Also the abundance of the beneficial Bifidobacterium genus was lowered, while the abundance of the notorious unclassified Enterobacteriaceae was increased. Within the family of the unclassified Lachnospiraceae, several genera were either suppressed or stimulated. The effects that these microbial alterations would have on a living host is not yet certain, especially given the fact that large fractions of soy lecithins constituents can be absorbed. Nevertheless, choline and phosphatidylcholine, both primary and absorbable constituents of soy lecithin, have recently been linked to cardiovascular disease via the generation of TMA by the gut microbiota.

Yet, little is known about the brain substrates and processes that contribute to everyday functional impairment, particularly during early stages of cognitive decline. We investigated everyday function using a complex gait task in normal older adults stratified by risk of cognitive impairment. We applied a novel EEG approach, which combines electroencephalographic with 3D-body tracking technology to measure brain-gait dynamics with millisecond precision while participants are in motion. Twenty-six participants (mean age = 74.9 years) with cognitive and everyday functional profiles within the normal range for their age and sex were ranked for risk of cognitive impairment. We used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment battery, a global index of cognition with a range from 0 to 30, to classify individuals as being at higher (22-26) and lower risk (27+). Individuals walking on a treadmill were exposed to visual perturbation designed to destabilize gait. Assuming that brain changes precede behavioral decline, we predicted that older adults increase step width to gain stability, yet the underlying neural signatures would be different for lower versus higher risk individuals. When pooling across risk groups, we found that step width increased and fronto-parietal activation shifted from transient, during swing phases, to sustained across the gait cycle during visually perturbed input. As predicted, step width increased in both groups but underlying neural signatures were different. Fronto-medial theta (3-7Hz) power of gait-related brain oscillations were increased in higher risk individuals during both perturbed and unperturbed inputs. On the other hand, left central gyri beta (13-28Hz) power was decreased in lower risk individuals, specifically during visually perturbed input. Finally, relating MoCA scores to spectral power pooled across fronto-parietal regions, we found associations between increased theta power and worse MoCA scores and between decreased beta power and better MoCA scores. Able-bodied older adults at-risk of cognitive impairment are characterized by unique neural signatures of mobility. Stronger reliance on frontomedial theta activation in at-risk individuals may reflect higher-order compensatory responses for deterioration of basic sensorimotor processes.

The septum consists of a primary septum flanked by secondary septa. First, delivery of the glucan synthase Bgs1 and membrane vesicles initiate primary septum synthesis and furrowing. Next, Bgs4 is delivered for secondary septum formation. It is unclear how septum synthesis is coordinated with membrane furrowing. Cdc42 promotes delivery of Bgs1 but not Bgs4. We find that after primary septum initiation, Cdc42 inactivators Rga4 and Rga6 localize to the division site. In <italic>rga4Δrga6Δ</italic> mutants Cdc42 activity is enhanced during late cytokinesis and cells take longer to separate. Electron micrographs of the division site in these mutants exhibit malformed septum with irregular membrane structures. These mutants have a larger division plane with enhanced Bgs1 delivery but fail to enhance accumulation of Bgs4 and several exocytic proteins. Additionally, these mutants show endocytic defects at the division site. This suggests that Cdc42 regulates only specific membrane trafficking events. Our data indicate that while active Cdc42 promotes primary septum synthesis, as cytokinesis progresses Rga4 and Rga6 localize to the division site to decrease Cdc42 activity.

To address this challenge, we focused on indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a prominent microbiota metabolite, and developed IAA-based chemical reporters for proteomic studies. We discovered that IAA interacts with many proteins in host cells, including small-molecule transporters, receptors and metabolic enzymes. Notably, our functional studies revealed that IAA binds to orphan G protein-coupled receptors such as GPRC5A, but only aromatic monoamines were capable of inducing GPRC5A signaling. Functional profiling of microbiota uncovered specific bacterial species and enzymes that generate GPRC5A agonists. Finally, biochemical characterization of GPRC5A activation identified more potent synthetic agonists as well as key amino acid residues involved in ligand binding.

We sought a new evolutionary perspective for Salvia by employing macroevolutionary analyses to address the tempo and mode of diversification. To study the association of floral traits with speciation and extinction, we modeled and explored the evolution of corolla length and the lever-mechanism pollination system across our Salvia phylogeny. 
Methods: We reconstructed a multigene phylogeny for 366 species of Salvia in the broad sense including all major recognized lineages and numerous species from Iran, a region previously overlooked in studies of the genus. Our phylogenetic data in combination with divergence time estimates were used to examine the evolution of corolla length, woody vs. herbaceous habit, and presence vs. absence of a lever mechanism. We investigated the timing and dependence of Salvia diversification related to corolla length evolution through a disparity test and BAMM analysis. A HiSSE model was used to evaluate the dependency of diversification on the lever-mechanism pollination system in Salvia.
Key Results: Based on recent investigations and classifications, Salvia is monophyletic and comprises ~1000 species. Our inclusion, for the first time, of a comprehensive sampling for Iranian species of Salvia provides higher phylogenetic resolution for southwestern Asian species than obtained in previous studies. A medium corolla length (15-18mm) was reconstructed as the ancestral state for Salvia with multiple shifts to shorter and longer corollas. Macroevolutionary model analyses indicate that corolla length disparity is high throughout Salvia evolution, significantly different from expectations under a Brownian motion model during the last 28 million years of evolution. Our analyses show evidence of a higher diversification rate of corolla length for some Andean species of Salvia compared to other members of the genus. Based on our tests of diversification models, we reject the hypothesis of a direct effect of the lever mechanism on Salvia diversification.
Conclusions: Using a broader species sampling than previous studies, we obtained a well-resolved phylogeny for southwest Asian species of Salvia. Corolla length is an adaptive trait throughout the Salvia phylogeny with a higher rate of diversification in the South American clade. Our results suggest caution in considering the lever-mechanism pollination system as one of the main drivers of speciation in Salvia.</p>",2021-12-17

HGH has been extensively engineered by other workers to improve binding and other properties. We used a computational screen to select substitutions at single hGH positions within the hGHR-binding site. We find that, while many successfully slow down dissociation of the hGH-hGHR complex once bound, they also slow down the association of hGH to hGHR. We are particularly interested in E174 which belongs to the hGH zinc-binding triad, and which spans coiled-coil helices and obeys the coiled-coil heptad pattern. Surprisingly, substituting E174 with A leads to substantial increase in an experimental measure of coiled-coil content. E174A is known to increase affinity of hGH against hGHR; here we show that this is simply because the off-rate is slowed down more than the on-rate, in line with what has been found for other affinity-improving mutations. For E174Y (and mutations at other sites) the slowdown in on-rate was greater, leading to decreased affinity. The results point to a link between coiled-coiling, zinc binding, and hGHR-binding affinity in hGH, and also suggest rules for choosing affinity-increasing substitutions.</p>",2021-12-17

For these purposes we created a database consisting of 347 records of the roller made ever in Ukraine. We employed a species distribution modeling (SDM) approach to hindcast changes in the suitable range of the roller during historical times across Ukraine and to derive spatially explicit predictions of climatic suitability for the species under current climate. SDMs were created for three time intervals (before 1980, 1985-2009, 2010-2021) using corresponding climate data extracted from the TerraClim database. SDMs show a decline of suitable for rollers areas in the country from 85 to 46%. Several factors, including land cover and use, human population density and climate, that could have contributed to the decline of the species in Ukraine were considered.

Our results show that macrophage uptake of emulsion particles mimicking VLDL (VLDLm) is dependent on lipoproteins lipase (LPL) and requires the lipoprotein-binding C-terminal domain of LPL but not the catalytic N-terminal domain. Subsequent internalization of VLDLm-triglycerides by macrophages is carried out by caveolae-mediated endocytosis, followed by triglyceride hydrolysis catalyzed by lysosomal acid lipase.

However, the deep learning model handled ambiguous tests more cautiously than other models; the deep learning model was more likely to designate an ambiguous test as inconclusive (odds ratio=4.21[2.78-6.38]) versus traditional/hybrid approaches.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>By considering complex spatial-temporal information beyond conventional anorectal function metrics, deep learning on 3D-HDAM technology may enable gastroenterologists to reliably identify and manage dyssynergia in broader practice.</p></sec>",2021-12-13

Due to possible systematic differences in stable isotope values between bone and dentine, dentine values can be transformed into bone-collagen equivalent using a correction factor. Here, we provide correction factors to transform dentine δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N values into bone-collagen equivalent for two toothed whales: narwhal and beluga. We sampled bone and tooth dentine from the skulls of 11 narwhals and 26 belugas. In narwhals, dentine was sampled from tusk and embedded tooth; in beluga, dentine was sampled from tooth. δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N were measured and intraindividual bone and dentine isotopic compositions were used to calculate correction factors for each species. We detected differences in δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N. In narwhals, we found (i) lower average δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N in bone compared with dentine; (ii) no difference in dentine δ<sup>13</sup>C between tusk and embedded tooth. For belugas, we also detected lower δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>15</sup>N in bone compared with tooth dentine. The correction factors provided by the study enable the combined analysis of stable isotope data from bone and dentine in these species.</p>",2021-12-14

For instance, cells decide which enzymes to produce at what quantity, but also where to position them. Here we focus on the spatial allocation problem of how to distribute enzymes such as to maximize the total reaction flux produced by them in a system with given geometry and boundary conditions. So far, such distributions have been studied by computational optimization, but a deeper theoretical understanding was lacking. We derive an optimal allocation principle, which demands that the available enzymes are distributed such that the marginal flux returns at each occupied position are equal. This ‘homogeneous marginal returns criterion’ (HMR criterion) corresponds to a portfolio optimization criterion in a scenario where each investment globally feeds back onto all payoffs. The HMR criterion allows us to analytically understand and characterize a localization-delocalization transition in the optimal enzyme distribution that was previously observed numerically. In particular, our analysis reveals the generality of the transition, and produces a practical test for the optimality of enzyme localization by comparing the reaction flux to the influx of substrate. Based on these results, we devise an additive construction algorithm, which builds up optimal enzyme arrangements systematically rather than by trial and error. Taken together, our results reveal a common principle in allocation problems from biology and economics, which can also serve as a design principle for synthetic biomolecular systems.</p>",2021-12-17

When dealing with such multi-omics data, the first step is to determine the correspondence among different modalities. In other words, we should match data from different spaces corresponding to the same object. This problem is particularly challenging in the single-cell multi-omics scenario because such data are very sparse with extremely high dimensions. Secondly, matched single-cell multi-omics data are rare and hard to collect. Furthermore, due to the limitations of the experimental environment, the data are usually highly noisy. To promote the single-cell multi-omics research, we overcome the above challenges, proposing a novel framework to align and integrate single-cell RNA-seq data and single-cell ATAC-seq data. Our approach can efficiently map the above data with high sparsity and noise from different spaces to a low-dimensional manifold in a unified space, making the downstream alignment and integration straightforward. Compared with the other state-of-the-art methods, our method performs better in both simulated and real single-cell data. The proposed method is helpful for the single-cell multi-omics research. The improvement for integration on the simulated data is significant.</p>",2021-12-13
