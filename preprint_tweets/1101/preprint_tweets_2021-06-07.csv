Across four experiments, we obtained a clear answer: music does not recruit nor requires the language system. The language regions’ responses to music are generally low and never exceed responses elicited by non-music auditory conditions, like animal sounds. Further, the language regions are not sensitive to music structure: they show low responses to both intact and scrambled music, and to melodies with vs. without structural violations. Finally, individuals with aphasia who cannot judge sentence grammaticality perform well on melody well-formedness judgments.

However how this happened remains unknown. Considering that tethering of the OM is essential for cell envelope stability in diderm bacteria we hypothesize that its destabilization may have been involved in OM loss. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of the four main OM tethering systems across all Bacteria. We show that their distribution strikingly follows the bacterial phylogeny with a bimodal distribution matching the deepest phylogenetic cleavage between Terrabacteria (a clade encompassing Cyanobacteria, Deinococcus/Thermus, Firmicutes, etc.) and Gracilicutes (a clade encompassing Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, etc.). Diderm Terrabacteria display as the main system OmpM, a porin that attaches non-covalently to modified peptidoglycan or to secondary cell wall polymers. In contrast, the lipoprotein Pal is restricted to the Gracilicutes along with a more sporadic occurrence of OmpA. While Braun’s lipoprotein Lpp is largely considered as the textbook example of OM attachment, it is actually present only in a subclade of Gammaproteobacteria. We propose an evolutionary scenario whereby the last common bacterial ancestor used a system based on OmpM, which was later replaced by one based on the lipoprotein Pal concomitantly to the emergence of the Lol machinery to address lipoproteins to the OM, with OmpA as a possible transition state. We speculate that the existence of only one main OM tethering system in the Terrabacteria would have allowed the multiple emergences of the monoderm phenotype specifically observed in this clade through OmpM perturbation. We test this hypothesis by inactivating all four <italic>ompM</italic> gene copies in the genetically tractable diderm Firmicute <italic>Veillonella parvula</italic>. The resulting mutant is severely affected in growth and displays high sensitivity to OM stress. High resolution imaging and tomogram reconstructions reveal a dramatic - yet non-lethal - phenotype, in which vast portions of the OM detach, producing large vesicles surrounding multiple monoderm-like cells sharing a common periplasm. Complementation by a single OmpM rescues the phenotype to a normal cell envelope. Together, our results highlight an ancient shift in bacterial evolution involving OM tethering systems. They suggest a possible mechanism for OM loss and a high flexibility of the cell envelope in diderm Firmicutes, making them ideal models to further refine our understanding of the mechanisms involved in bacterial OM stability, and opening the way to recapitulate the monoderm/diderm transition in the laboratory.</p>",2021-05-31

However, the detailed protein-protein interactions linking FKBP51 to autophagy upon metabolic challenges remain elusive. We performed mass spectrometry-based metabolomics of FKBP51 knockout (KO) cells revealing an increased amino acid and polyamine metabolism. We identified FKBP51 as a central nexus for the recruitment of the LKB1/AMPK complex to WIPI4 and TSC2 to WIPI3, thereby regulating the balance between autophagy and mTOR signaling in response to metabolic challenges. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MBH FKBP51 deletion strongly induces obesity, while its overexpression protects against high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity.

Using time-resolved cryo-EM, we visualized GTP-catalyzed translocation without inhibitors, capturing elusive structures of ribosome•EF-G intermediates at near-atomic resolution. Prior to translocation, EF-G binds near peptidyl-tRNA, while the rotated 30S subunit stabilizes the EF-G GTPase center. Reverse 30S rotation releases Pi and translocates peptidyl-tRNA and EF-G by ∼20 Å. An additional 4-Å translocation initiates EF-G dissociation from a transient ribosome state with highly swiveled 30S head.

Five of these studies were case reports or case series that included up to 5 individuals. Seven studies included cohorts of both outpatients and hospitalized individuals and found strong associations between virus isolation and time from symptom onset and viral RNA level.

This local modulation generates dendritic plasticity microdomains believed to expand the neuronal computational capacity. Here, we investigate whether local modulation of plasticity can also occur between glutamatergic synapses and adjacent GABAergic synapses. Using MNI-glutamate and DPNI-GABA double uncaging combined with electrophysiology, live-cell imaging and single-particle tracking, we find that the induction of LTP at an individual glutamatergic spine causes the depression of nearby GABAergic inhibitory synapses (within 3 microns), whereas more distant ones are potentiated. Notably, L-type calcium channels and calpain are required for this plasticity spreading. Overall, our data support a model whereby input-specific glutamatergic postsynaptic potentiation induces a spatially-regulated rearrangement of inhibitory synaptic strength in the surrounding area through short-range heterosynaptic interactions. Such local coordination of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity is expected to profoundly influence dendritic information processing and integration.</p>",2021-05-31

Their accuracy and potential for generalization vary widely based on the training data. Here, we gathered 143 publicly available data sets from several human tissues to develop AltumAge, a highly accurate and precise age predictor based on deep learning. Compared to Horvath’s 2013 model, AltumAge performs better across both normal and malignant tissues and is more generalizable to new data sets. Interestingly, it can predict gestational week from placental tissue with low error. Lastly, we used deep learning interpretation methods to learn which methylation sites contributed to the final model predictions. We observed that while most important CpG sites are linearly related to age, some highly-interacting CpG sites can influence the relevance of such relationships. We studied the associated genes of these CpG sites and found literary evidence of their involvement in age-related gene regulation. Using chromatin annotations, we observed that the CpG sites with the highest contribution to the model predictions were related to heterochromatin and gene regulatory regions in the genome. We also found age-related KEGG pathways for genes containing these CpG sites. In general, neural networks are better predictors due to their ability to capture complex feature interactions compared to the typically used regularized linear regression.

However, whether increased lifespan is caused by a compression of the portion of life spent in a state of morbidity, i.e., “sickspan,” is highly debated. It is unclear which health matrices are representative for measuring healthspan (time spent in good health); however, muscular performance is generally a good indicator for the health status in humans and a predictor for their mortality, regardless of the underlying cause. Here, we developed a novel microfluidic device that employs acoustophoretic force fields to quantify the maximum muscle strength and dynamic power in aging <italic>C. elegans</italic> populations. We found that longevity mutants have a delayed onset and lower declining rates in maximum muscle strength compared to wild type. Reconciling previous conflicting reports, we confirmed that certain longevity mutants exhibited a mild increase in relative sickspan measured by voluntary movement matrices, which is not the case when using our acoustophoretic force measurements, swim endurance, or other approaches. Using six different biomarkers for healthspan, we observed a time-dependent onset of morbidity, starting with a loss of stress resilience, a decline in dynamic power, and a decline in structural integrity, culminating finally in inactivity (lethargy) and a loss of mobility. We observed that a subset of aging biomarkers correlate with each other and maybe functionally interconnected. Surprisingly, we did not observe a compression of sickspan in longevity mutants but instead observed a temporal scaling of healthspan with diminishing returns for extreme lifespan extensions. Given the conservation of these longevity interventions, this raises the question of whether the healthspan of mammalian longevity interventions is temporally scaled as well.</p>",2021-05-31

The particles adopt spherical and bipyramidal morphologies, and display both stable (α-S<sub>8</sub>) and metastable (β-S<sub>8</sub>) crystal structures.

Organic encapsulation and the presence of metastable crystal structures are consistent with elemental sulfur organomineralization, i.e. the formation and stabilization of elemental sulfur in the presence of organics, a mechanism that has previously been observed in laboratory studies. This research provides new evidence for the important role of microbial EPS in mineral formation in the environment. We hypothesize that extracellular organics are used by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria for the stabilization of elemental sulfur minerals outside of the cell wall as a store of chemical energy.

While their behaviour, ecology, and evolution are well studied, information on their circadian rhythms are scarce. We quantified the daily locomotor activity rhythm under a light-dark cycle (LD) and under constant darkness (DD). Under LD, all fish exhibited significant daily rhythmicity, while under DD, only 18% of individuals remained rhythmic. This interindividual variation suggests that the circadian clock controls activity only in certain individuals. Moreover, under LD, some fish were almost exclusively nocturnal, while others were active around the clock. Furthermore, the most nocturnal fish were also the least active. These results suggest that light masks activity more strongly in some individuals than others. Finally, we quantified the expression of five clock genes in the brain of sticklebacks under DD using qPCR. We did not detect circadian rhythmicity, which could either indicate that the clock molecular oscillator is highly light-dependent, or that there was an oscillation but that we were unable to detect it. Overall, our study suggests that a strong circadian control on behavioural rhythms may not necessarily be advantageous in a natural population of sticklebacks and that the daily phase of activity varies greatly between individuals because of a differential masking effect of light.</p><sec><title>Summary statement</title><p>We found that in wild-caught threespine sticklebacks, the circadian clock does not control locomotor activity in most, but not all, individuals.

Alarming concern is, the number of second wave infections surpassed the first wave and the onset of severe symptoms manifesting rapidly. In this scenario, testing of maximum population in less time and minimum cost with existing diagnostic amenities is the only possible way to control the spread of the virus. The previously described RNA extraction-free methods using dry swab have been shown to be advantageous in these critical times by different studies. In this work, we show the temporal stability and performance of the dry swab viral detection method at two different temperatures. Contrived dry swabs holding serially diluted SARS-CoV-2 strains A2a and A3i at 25°C (room temperature; RT) and 4°C were subjected to direct RT-PCR and compared with standard VTM-RNA based method. The results clearly indicate that dry swab method of RNA detection is as efficient as VTM-RNA-based method in both strains, when checked for up to 72 hours. The lesser C<sub>T</sub> values of dry swab samples in comparison to that of the VTM-RNA samples suggest better sensitivity of the method within 48 hours of time. The results collectively suggest that dry swab samples are stable at RT for 24 hours and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR do not show variance from VTM-RNA. This extraction free, direct RT-PCR method holds phenomenal standing in the present life-threatening circumstances due to SARS-CoV-2.</p>",2021-05-31

Here we present a expanded benchmarking study of eleven recent network inference methods on six published single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets in human, mouse, and yeast considering different types of gold standard networks and evaluation metrics. We evaluate methods based on their computing requirements as well as on their ability to recover the network structure. We find that while no method is a universal winner and most methods have a modest recovery of experimentally derived interactions based on global metrics such as AUPR, methods are able to capture targets of regulators that are relevant to the system under study. Based on overall performance we grouped the methods into three main categories and found a combination of information-theoretic and regression-based methods to have a generally high performance. We also evaluate the utility of imputation for gene regulatory network inference and find that a small number of methods benefit from imputation, which further depends upon the dataset. Finally, comparisons to inferred networks for comparable bulk conditions showed that networks inferred from scRNA-seq datasets are often better or at par to those from bulk suggesting that scRNA-seq datasets can be a cost-effective way for gene regulatory network inference.

Oxytocin secretion is relatively low and constant under basal conditions but becomes pulsatile during birth and lactation to stimulate episodic contraction of the uterus for delivery of the fetus and milk ejection during suckling. Vasopressin secretion is maintained in pregnancy and lactation despite reduced osmolality (the principal stimulus for vasopressin secretion) to increase water retention to cope with the cardiovascular demands of pregnancy and lactation. Oxytocin and vasopressin secretion are determined by the action potential (spike) firing of magnocellular neurosecretory neurons of the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nucleus. In addition to synaptic input activity, spike firing depends on intrinsic excitability conferred by the suite of channels expressed by the neurons. Therefore, we analysed oxytocin and vasopressin neuron activity in anaesthetised non-pregnant, late-pregnant and lactating rats to test the hypothesis that intrinsic excitability of oxytocin and vasopressin neurons is increased in late pregnancy and lactation to promote oxytocin and vasopressin secretion required for successful pregnancy and lactation. Hazard analysis of spike firing revealed a higher incidence of post-spike hyperexcitability immediately following each spike in oxytocin neurons, but not in vasopressin neurons, in late pregnancy and lactation, which is expected to facilitate high frequency firing during bursts. Despite lower osmolality in late-pregnant and lactating rats, vasopressin neuron activity was not different between non-pregnant, late-pregnant and lactating rats, and blockade of osmosensitive ΔN-TRPV1 channels inhibited vasopressin neurons to a similar extent in non-pregnant, late-pregnant and lactating rats.

Existing approaches for detecting long-range interactions consist of propagating information from source nodes through cellular networks, but the selection of source nodes is inherently biased by prior knowledge. Here, we sought to derive an unbiased view of long-range interactions by adapting a perturbation-response scanning strategy initially developed for identifying allosteric interactions within proteins. We deployed this strategy onto an elastic network model of the yeast genetic network. The genetic network revealed a superior propensity for long-range interactions relative to simulated networks with similar topology. Long-range interactions were detected systematically throughout the network and found to be enriched in specific biological processes. Furthermore, perturbation-response scanning identified the major sources and receivers of information in the network, named effector and sensor genes, respectively. Effectors formed dense clusters centrally integrated into the network, whereas sensors formed loosely connected antenna-shaped clusters. Long-range interactions between effector and sensor clusters represent the major paths of information in the network. Our results demonstrate that elastic network modeling of cellular networks constitutes a promising strategy to probe the high-level organization of the cell.</p>",2021-06-04

The EccC enzyme comprises two polypeptides (i) EccCa1, a membrane bound enzyme having two ATPase domains D2 &amp; D3 (ii) cytosolic EccCb, which contains two ATPase domains. In current study, we have analyzed the low-resolution structure of EccCb1, performed ATPase activity and EsxAB substrate binding analysis. The EccCb1 enzyme eluted as oligomer from size exclusion column and small angle X-ray scattering analysis revealed the double hexameric structure in solution. The EccCb1 enzyme showed catalytic efficiency (<italic>k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub></italic>)∼ 0.020±0.005 μM<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>, however ∼ 3.7 fold lower than its D2 and ∼1.7 fold lower than D3 domains respectively. The D2 and D3 domains exhibited the ATPase activity and mutation of residues involved in ATP+Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding have yielded 56-94% reduction in catalytic efficiency for both D2 and D3 domains. The EccCb1 binds the EsxAB substrate with <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> ∼ 11.4±3.4 nM via specific groove located at C-terminal region of D3 domain. ATP binding to EccCb1 enhanced the EsxAB substrate binding by ∼ 3 fold, indicating ATPase energy involvement in EsxAB substrate translocation.

The enzyme dynamics involved in ATP+Mg<sup>2+</sup> and EsxAB substrate recognition were identified and showed the enhanced stability of EccCb1 enzyme as a result of ligand binding. Overall, our structural and biochemical analysis showed the low-resolution structure and mechanism involved in ATPase activity and EsxAB substrate binding and dynamics involved in EsxAB substrate and ATP+Mg<sup>2+</sup> recognition.

Allied to this is the potential for long perm persistent infections within immune compromised individuals to allow a broader range of viral evolution in the face of sub-optimal immune driven selective pressure. Here we report on an immunocompromised individual who is hypogammaglobulinaemic and was persistently infected with SARS-CoV-2 for over 290 days, the longest persistent infection recorded in the literature to date. During this time, nine samples of viral nucleic acid were obtained and analysed by next-generation sequencing. Initially only a single mutation (L179I) was detected in the spike protein relative to the prototypic SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate, with no further changes identified at day 58. However, by day 155 the spike protein had acquired a further four amino acid changes, namely S255F, S477N, H655Y and D1620A and a two amino acid deletion (ΔH69/ΔV70). Infectious virus was cultured from a nasopharyngeal sample taken on day 155 and next-generation sequencing confirmed that the mutations in the virus mirrored those identified by sequencing of the corresponding swab sample. The isolated virus was susceptible to remdesivir in vitro, however a 17-day course of remdesivir started on day 213 had no effect on the viral RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value. On day 265 the patient was treated with the combination of casirivimab and imdevimab. The patient experienced progressive resolution of all symptoms over the next 8 weeks and by day 311 the virus was no longer detectable by RT-PCR. The ΔH69/ΔV70 deletion in the N-terminus of the spike protein which arose in our patient is also present in the B.1.1.7 variant of concern and has been associated with viral escape mutagenesis after treatment of another immunocompromised patient with convalescent plasma. Our data confirms the significance of this deletion in immunocompromised patients but illustrates it can arise independently of passive antibody transfer, suggesting the deletion may be an enabling mutation that compensates for distant changes in the spike protein that arise under selective pressure.</p>",2021-06-04

We aimed to delineate immunological features of COVID-19 patients with pulmonary sequelae (PS) one year after discharge. 50 COVID-19 survivors were recruited and classified according to radiological characteristics: 24 patients with PS and 26 patients without PS. Phenotypic and functional characteristics of immune cells were evaluated by multiparametric flow cytometry. Patients with PS had an increased proportion of natural killer (NK) cells and lower percentage of B cells compared to patients without PS. Phenotypic and functional features of T cells in patients with PS were predominated by the accumulation of CD4+ T cells secreting IL-17A, short-lived effector-like CD8+ T cells (CD27-CD62L-) and senescent T cells with excessive secretion of granzyme-B/perforin/IFN-γ. NK cells were characterized by the excessive secretion of granzyme-B and perforin and the downregulation of NKP30 and NKP46; highly activated NKT and γδ T cells exhibited NKP30 and TIM-3 upregulation and NKB1 downregulation in patients with PS. However, immunosuppressive cells were comparable between the two groups. The interrelation of immune cells in COVID-19 was intrinsically identified, whereby T cells secreting IL-2, IL-4 and IL-17A were enriched among CD28+ and CD57- cells and cells secreting perforin/granzyme-B/IFN-γ/TNF-α expressed markers of terminal differentiation. CD57+NK cells, CD4+perforin+ T cells and CD8+CD27+CD62L+ T cells were identified as the independent predictors for residual lesions. Overall, our findings unveil the profound imbalance of immune landscape that may correlate with organ damage and rehabilitation in COVID-19.</p>",2021-06-04
