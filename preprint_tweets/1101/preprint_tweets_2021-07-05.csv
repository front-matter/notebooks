Recently a rare and novel complication of SARS-CoV-2 targeted adenovirus vaccines has emerged: thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). TTS is characterized by low platelet counts, clot formation at unusual anatomic sites and platelet-activating PF4-polyanion antibodies reminiscent of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Here, we employ <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models to characterize the possible mechanisms of this platelet-targeted autoimmunity. We show that intravenous but not intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 triggers platelet-adenovirus aggregate formation and platelet activation. After intravenous injection, these aggregates are phagocytosed by macrophages in the spleen and platelet remnants are found in the marginal zone and follicles. This is followed by a pronounced B-cell response with the emergence of circulating antibodies binding to platelets. Our work contributes to the understanding of TTS and highlights accidental intravenous injection as potential mechanism for post-vaccination TTS. Hence, safe intramuscular injection, with aspiration prior to injection, could be a potential preventive measure when administering adenovirus-based vaccines.</p>",2021-06-29

The lineage further mutated to generate sub-lineages B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.617.3. Apparently, the Delta variant has slowly dominated the other variants including B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.617.3. With this, World Health Organization has described this sub-lineage as variant of concern. The high transmissibility associated with Delta variant has led to second wave of pandemic in India which affected millions of people. Besides this, variant of concerns has been reported to show lower neutralization to several approved vaccines. This has led to breakthrough infections after completion of vaccination regimen. There is limited information available on the duration of protective immune response post-infection, vaccination or breakthrough infection with SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we have evaluated immune response in sera of the Covishield vaccinated individuals belonging to category: I. one dose vaccinated, II. two doses vaccinated, III. COVID-19 recovered plus one dose vaccinated, IV. COVID-19 recovered plus two doses vaccinated and V. breakthrough COVID-19 cases. The findings of the study demonstrated that the breakthrough cases and the COVID-19 recovered individuals with one or two dose of vaccine had relatively higher protection against Delta variant in comparison to the participants who were administered either one or two doses of Covishield. Prior vaccination results in less severe disease against subsequent infection provide evidence that both humoral and cellular immune response play an important role in protection.</p>",2021-07-02

The medial amygdala (MeA) receives pheromone information about conspecifics and has crucial functions in social behaviors; interestingly, this amygdalar structure contains a majority of GABAergic projection neurons. A previous study showed that optogenetic activation of MeA GABA neurons with channelrhodopsin-2<sup>H134R</sup> (ChR2) strongly enhanced inter-male aggression (Hong et al. 2014, Cell). When we attempted to reproduce these findings, accidentally using a faster channelrhodopsin variant (channelrhodopsin-2<sup>H134R,E123T</sup> or ChETA), we found the opposite results. We therefore systematically compared the behavioral outcome of optogenetic stimulation of MeApd GABA neurons with ChETA versus ChR2, employing two widely used AAV serotypes.

Although histones released from dying cells can act as extracellular signaling molecules, all intracellular histone molecules are assumed to have originated from the cell in which they reside<sup>2–6</sup>. Here we show that histone H3 is horizontally transferred between viable cells. Using an ER-targeted biotin ligase to detect secreted proteins<sup>7,8</sup>, we serendipitously discovered that histone H3 is selectively secreted by autophagic cells relative to histones H2A, H2B, and H4. Specific H3 posttranslational modifications are enriched or depleted on secreted H3 relative to intracellular H3, suggesting that specific PTMs dictate H3’s ability to be secreted or the information it conveys to neighboring cells. Remarkably, we found that secreted H3 can enter the nuclei of recipient cells in an autophagy-independent and cell contactindependent manner ex vivo and in vivo. These findings have implications for cell-cell communication during nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, and perhaps other forms of cellular stress, and for the ability to deliver macromolecules across cell membranes.</p>",2021-06-30

However, the storage and analysis of nanopore sequencing data have become major bottlenecks preventing more widespread adoption in research and clinical genomics. Here, we elucidate an inherent limitation in the file format used to store raw nanopore data – known as FAST5 – that prevents efficient analysis on high-performance computing (HPC) systems. To overcome this, we have developed SLOW5, an alternative file format that permits efficient parallelisation and, thereby, acceleration of nanopore data analysis. For example, we show that using SLOW5 format, instead of FAST5, reduces the time and cost of genome-wide DNA methylation profiling by an order of magnitude on common HPC systems, and delivers consistent improvements on a wide range of different architectures. With a simple, accessible file structure and a <sup>~</sup>25% reduction in size compared to FAST5, SLOW5 format will deliver substantial benefits to all areas of the nanopore community.</p>",2021-06-30

Previous research has shown that participants may underweight information incompatible with previous choices, a phenomenon called confirmation bias. In this paper we argue that a similar bias exists in the way information is actively sought. We investigate how choice influences information gathering using a perceptual choice task and find that participants sample more information from a previously chosen alternative. Furthermore, the higher the confidence in the initial choice, the more biased information sampling becomes. As a consequence, when faced with the possibility of revising an earlier decision, participants are more likely to stick with their original choice, even when incorrect. Critically, we show that agency controls this phenomenon. The effect disappears in a fixed sampling condition where presentation of evidence is controlled by the experimenter, suggesting that the way in which confirmatory evidence is acquired critically impacts the decision process. These results suggest active information acquisition plays a critical role in the propagation of strongly held beliefs over time.</p>",2021-06-30

Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of ecologically more valid experimental paradigms using natural viewing behavior, by combining a free viewing paradigm on natural scenes, free of photographer bias, with advanced data processing techniques that correct for overlap effects and co-varying nonlinear dependencies of multiple eye movement parameters. We validate this approach by replicating classic N170 effects in neural responses, triggered by fixation onsets (fERPs). Importantly, our more natural stimulus paradigm yielded smaller variability between subjects than the classic setup. Moving beyond classic temporal and spatial effect locations, our experiment furthermore revealed previously unknown signatures of face processing.

Of these, CG147 includes 7-gene MLST sequence types ST147, ST273 and ST392. CG147 has caused nosocomial outbreaks across the world, but its global population dynamics remain unknown. Here, we report a pandrug-resistant ST147 clinical isolate from India (strain DJ) and define the evolution and global emergence of CG147. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (EUCAST guidelines) and genome sequencing (Illumina and Oxford Nanopore technologies, Unicycler assembly) were performed on strain DJ. Additionally, we collated 217 publicly available CG147 genomes (NCBI, May 2019). CG147 evolution was inferred within a temporal phylogenetic framework (BEAST) based on a recombination-free sequence alignment (Roary/Gubbins). Comparative genomic analyses focused on resistance and virulence genes and other genetic elements (BIGSdb, Kleborate, PlasmidFinder, PHASTER, ICEFinder and CRISPRCasFinder). Results: Strain DJ had a pandrug resistance phenotype. Its genome comprised 7 plasmids and 1 linear phage-plasmid. Four carbapenemase genes were detected: blaNDM-5 and 2 copies of blaOXA-181 in the chromosome, and a second copy of blaNDM-5 on an 84 kb IncFII plasmid. CG147 genomes carried a mean of 13 acquired resistance genes or mutations; 63% carried a carbapenemase gene and 83% harbored blaCTX-M. All CG147 genomes presented GyrA and ParC mutations and a common subtype IV-E CRISPR-Cas system. ST392 and ST273 emerged in 2005 and 1995, respectively. ST147, the most represented phylogenetic branch, was itself divided into two main clades with distinct capsular loci: KL64 (74%, DJ included, emerged in 1994 and disseminated worldwide, with carbapenemases varying among world regions) and KL10 (20%, 2002, predominantly found in Asian countries, associated with carbapenemases NDM and OXA-48-like). Further, subclades within ST147-KL64 differed in the yersiniabactin locus, OmpK35/K36 mutations, plasmid replicons and prophages. The absence of IncF plasmids in some subclades was associated with a possible activity of a CRISPR-Cas system. Conclusions: K. pneumoniae clonal group CG147 comprises pandrug- or extensively-resistant isolates and carries multiple and diverse resistance genes and mobile genetic elements, including chromosomal blaNDM-5. Its emergence is driven by the spread of several phylogenetic clades marked by their own genomic features and specific temporo-spatial dynamics. These findings highlight the need for precision surveillance strategies to limit the spread of particularly concerning CG147 subsets.</p>",2021-07-03

Despite early recognition that subjects may engage in a variety of behaviors that reflect the experimental parameters of a given protocol, the last several decades have seen the field narrow its focus to measure freezing as the sole indicator of conditioned fear. Additionally, unconditioned responses such as shock-related activity are rarely considered. We previously reported that female Sprague Dawley rats are more likely than males to engage in darting, an escape-like conditioned response that is associated with heightened shock reactivity, but we did not establish whether darting was sensitive to manipulations of factors such as chamber size, shock intensity, or number of trials. Our goal here was to address these questions by defining parametric and phenotypic predictors of darting in both sexes. To better capture fear-related behavioral repertoires in our animals, we developed ScaredyRat, a custom Python tool that analyzes Noldus Ethovision-generated raw data files to identify Darters and quantify both conditioned and unconditioned responses. We find that like freezing, darting probability scales with experimental alterations in multiple dimensions.

The structural connectome imposes a spatial network constraint since two structurally connected brain regions are more likely to coordinate their activity. It also imposes a temporal network constraint by virtue of time delays via signal transmission, which has modulatory effects on oscillatory signals. Specifically, the lengths of the structural bundles, their widths, myelination, and the topology of the structural connectome influence the timing of the interactions across the brain network. Together, they define a space-time structure (topochronic map) spanned by connection strengths (space) and signal transmission delays (time), which together establish the deterministic scaffold underlying the evolution of brain dynamics. We introduce a novel in vivo approach for directly measuring functional delays across the whole brain using magneto/electroencephalography and integrating them with the structural connectome derived from magnetic resonance imaging. We developed a map of the functional delays characterizing the connections across the human brain and a map of the corresponding functional velocities. This yields a topochronic map of the human brain dynamics. The functional delays are tightly regulated, with a trend showing, as expected, that larger structural bundles had faster velocities, with the delays varying much less than expected if they only depended upon distance. Then, we estimated the delays from magnetoencephalography (MEG) data in a cohort of multiple sclerosis patients, who have damaged myelin sheaths, and demonstrated that patients showed greater delays across the whole network than a matched control group. Furthermore, within each patient, individual lesioned connections were slowed down more than unaffected ones. Our technique provides a practical approach for estimating functional transmission delays in vivo at the single-subject and single-fiber level and, thus, opens the possibility for novel diagnostic and curative interventions as well as providing empirical, subject-specific constraints to tailor brain models.</p>",2021-07-02

These symptoms lie on a behavioural dimension that is shared with social behaviour in the general population, with substantial contributions of genetic factors. However, shared genetic links may vary across psychiatric disorders and social symptoms. Here, we systematically investigate heterogeneity in shared genetic liabilities with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders (ASD), bipolar disorder (BP), major depression (MD) and schizophrenia, across a spectrum of different social symptoms. Specifically, longitudinally assessed low-prosociality and peer-problem scores in two UK population-based/community-based cohorts (ALSPAC, N ≤ 6174, 4-17 years; TEDS, N ≤ 7112, 4-16 years; parent- and teacher-reports) were regressed on polygenic risk scores for ADHD, ASD, BP, MD, and schizophrenia, as informed by genome-wide summary statistics from large consortia, using negative binomial regression models. Across ALSPAC and TEDS, we replicated univariate polygenic associations between social behaviour and risk for ADHD, MD, and schizophrenia. Modelling univariate genetic effects across both cohorts with random-effect meta-regression revealed evidence for polygenic links between social behaviour and ADHD, ASD, MD, and schizophrenia risk, but not BP, where differences in age, reporter and social trait captured 45-88% in univariate effect variation. For ADHD, MD, and ASD polygenic risk, we identified stronger association with peer problems than low prosociality, while schizophrenia polygenic risk was solely associated with low prosociality. The identified association profiles suggest marked differences in the social genetic architecture underlying different psychiatric disorders when investigating population-based social symptoms across 13 years of child and adolescent development.</p>",2021-07-01

Unlike other molecular machines, such as ribosomes, that simply assemble and catalyze chemical reactions, “the spliceosome” is a highly-dynamic cycle, carried out by 5 specialized small nuclear RNAs and over 100 proteins, which sequentially join, rearrange, and withdraw from the splicing assembly during each splicing cycle. These assemblies initially choose “splice sites” where the pre-mRNA will be cut, and then undergo multiple rearrangements to finally form the active site which catalyzes the splicing reactions which remove an intron from a pre-mRNA. We are currently in the midst of a “resolution revolution”, with ever-clearer cryo-EM snapshots of stalled complexes allowing researchers to visualize moments in time in the splicing cycle. These models are illuminating, but do not always elucidate mechanistic functioning, therefore our lab takes a complementary approach, using the power of genetics in a multicellular animal to gain functional insights into the spliceosome. Using a <italic>C .elegans</italic> genetic screen, we have found novel functional splicing roles for two proteins, KIN17 and PRCC. Our results suggest that the spliceosome does not just rely on its initial identification of the splice site, but in a later step, re-identifies where to cut. We liken this two-stage identification to using a microscope by first using the coarse focus to find the area of interest, and then using the fine focus to adjust as needed. This work moves us closer to full mechanistic understanding of how the spliceosome chooses where to cut a pre-mRNA message.</p></sec>",2021-06-30

Whether the source of selection is primarily the fixation of strongly beneficial alleles (selective sweeps) or purifying selection on deleterious mutations (background selection) remains unknown, however. We address this question in humans by fitting a model of the joint effects of selective sweeps and background selection to autosomal polymorphism data from the 1000 Genomes Project. After controlling for variation in mutation rates along the genome, a model of background selection alone explains ~60% of the variance in diversity levels at the megabase scale. Adding the effects of selective sweeps driven by adaptive substitutions to the model does not improve the fit, and when both modes of selection are considered jointly, selective sweeps are estimated to have had little or no effect on linked neutral diversity. The regions under purifying selection are best predicted by phylogenetic conservation, with ~80% of the deleterious mutations affecting neutral diversity occurring in non-exonic regions. Thus, background selection is the dominant mode of linked selection in humans, with marked effects on diversity levels throughout autosomes.</p>",2021-07-02

In zebrafish, arterial intersegmental vessels together with chemokines have been shown to promote lymphatic cell migration from the horizontal myoseptum (HM). Here we found that LECs departure from HM coincides with the emergence of mural cells around the intersegmental arteries, raising the possibility that arterial mural cells promote LEC migration. Our live imaging and cell ablation experiments revealed that LECs migrate slower and fail to establish the lymphatic vascular network in the absence of arterial mural cells. We determined that mural cells are a source for the C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (Cxcl12a and Cxcl12b) and vascular endothelial growth factor C (Vegfc). We showed that ERK, a downstream component of Vegfc-Vegfr3 singling cascade, is activated in migrating LECs and that both chemokine and growth factor signalling is required for the robust migration.

To facilitate gene identification, we employed a Reduced Complexity Cross between closely related C57BL/6 mouse substrains and examined maximum speed and distance traveled over 30 min following methamphetamine (2 mg/kg, i.p.). For maximum methamphetamine-induced speed following the second and third administration, we identified a single genome-wide significant QTL on chromosome 11 that peaked near the <italic>Cyfip2</italic> locus [LOD = 3.5, 4.2; peak = 21 cM (36 Mb)].

The biosynthesis of these deterrent, often toxic metabolites is costly, as their synthesis diverts energy and resources on account of growth and development. How plants diversify investments into growth and defense is explained by the optimal defense theory. The central prediction of the optimal defense theory is that plants maximize growth and defense by concentrating specialized metabolites in tissues that are decisive for fitness. To date, supporting physiological evidence merely relies on the correlation between plant metabolite distribution and animal feeding preference. Here, we use glucosinolates as a model to examine the effect of changes in chemical defense distribution on actual feeding behavior. Taking advantage of the uniform glucosinolate distribution in transporter mutants, we show that high glucosinolate accumulation in tissues important to fitness protects them by guiding larvae of a generalist herbivore to feed on other tissues. Moreover, we show that mature leaves of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> supply young leaves with glucosinolates to optimize defense against herbivores.

Notably, female song was absent during the dawn chorus; the period around sunrise when males sing intensively just before mating. Female and male song overlapped substantially in acoustic structure (i.e. same song types, peak frequency or trill rates) but there were also significant differences in that females had smaller repertoires, shorter trills and lower vocal consistency. Differential selections pressures related with contextual (functional) differences in the role of male and female song could explain the observed differences in acoustic structure. The new finding of prolific female singing in such a well-studied species suggests we ought to revise our understanding of male and female vocal communication in this (and probably other) species. Identifying the selection pressures associated to the convergence versus divergence of male and female song may provide important insight in understanding birdsong evolution.</p><sec><title>Lay summary</title><p>Female song has been anecdotally reported in blue tits but there are no quantitative studies of singing behaviour, song structure or context.

We describe a point of care, lateral flow assay for SARS-CoV-2 dIgA based on the highly selective binding of dIgA to a chimeric form of secretory component (CSC), that distinguishes dIgA from monomeric IgA. Detection of specific dIgA uses a complex of biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain and streptavidin-colloidal gold. SARS-CoV-2-specific dIgA was measured both in 112 cross-sectional samples and a longitudinal panel of 362 plasma samples from 45 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 193 discrete pre-COVID-19 or PCR-negative patient samples. The assay demonstrated 100% sensitivity from 11 days post-symptom onset, and a specificity of 98.2%. With an estimated half-life of 6.3 days, dIgA provides a unique biomarker for the detection of recent SARS-CoV-2 infections with potential to enhance diagnosis and management of COVID-19 at point-of-care.</p>",2021-07-01

The algorithm is inspired by the kinetic partitioning mechanism, by which molecules follow alternative folding pathways to their native structure, some much faster than others. Similarly, our algorithm RAFFT generates an ensemble of concurrent folding pathways ending in multiple metastable structures for each given sequence; this is in contrast with traditional thermodynamic approaches, which are based on aim to find single structures with minimal free energies. When analyzing 50 predicted folds per sequence, we found near-native predictions (79% PPV and 81% sensitivity) for RNAs of length &lt; 200 nucleotides, matching the performance of recent deep-learning-based structure prediction methods. Our algorithm also acts as a folding kinetic ansatz, which we tested on two RNAs: the coronavirus frameshifting stimulation element (CFSE) and a classic bi-stable sequence. For the CFSE, an ensemble of 68 distinct structures computed by RAFFT allowed us to produce complete folding kinetic trajectories, whereas known methods require evaluating millions of sub-optimal structures to achieve this result. For the second application, only 46 distinct structures were required to reproduce the kinetics, whereas known methods required a sample of 20,000 structures. Thanks to the efficiency of the fast Fourier transform on which RAFFT is based, these computations are efficient, with complexity O(L^2 log L).</p>",2021-07-04

We investigated whether Network Diffusion Model (NDM), a biophysical model of spread of pathology via the brain connectome, could capture the severity and progression of neurodegeneration (atrophy) in ALS. We measured degeneration in limb-onset ALS patients (n=14 at baseline, 12 at 6-months, and 9 at 12 months) and controls (n=12 at baseline) using FreeSurfer analysis on the structural T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. The NDM was simulated on the canonical structural connectome from the IIT Human Brain Atlas. To determine whether NDM could predict the atrophy pattern in ALS, the accumulation of pathology modelled by NDM was correlated against atrophy measured using MRI. The cross-sectional analyses revealed that the network diffusion seeded from the inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis and pars orbitalis) significantly predicts the atrophy pattern in ALS compared to controls. Whereas, atrophy over time with-in the ALS group was best predicted by seeding the network diffusion process from the inferior temporal gyrus at 6-month and caudal middle frontal gyrus at 12-month. Our findings suggest the involvement of extra-motor regions in seeding the spread of pathology in ALS. Importantly, NDM was able to recapitulate the dynamics of pathological progression in ALS. Understanding the spatial shifts in the seeds of degeneration over time can potentially inform further research in the design of disease modifying therapeutic interventions in ALS.</p>",2021-07-02

Methods originally developed for bulk samples are often used for this purpose without accounting for contextual differences between bulk and single-cell data. More broadly, these methods have not been benchmarked. Here we benchmark four such supervised methods, including single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), AUCell, Single Cell Signature Explorer (SCSE), and a new method we developed, Jointly Assessing Signature Mean and Inferring Enrichment (JASMINE). Using cancer as an example, we show cancer cells consistently express more genes than normal cells. This imbalance leads to bias in performance by bulk-sample-based ssGSEA in gold standard tests and down sampling experiments. In contrast, single-cell-based methods are less susceptible. Our results suggest caution should be exercised when using bulk-sample-based methods in single-cell data analyses, and cellular contexts should be taken into consideration when designing benchmarking strategies.</p>",2021-07-01

In our pursuit to establish a model for severe COVID-19, we inoculated young and adult male ferrets intranasally or intratracheally with SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal inoculation established an infection in all ferrets, with viral dissemination into the brain and gut. Upon intratracheal inoculation only adult ferrets became infected. However, neither inoculation route induced observable COVID-19 symptoms. Despite this, a persistent inflammation in the nose was prominent in especially young ferrets and follicular hyperplasia in the bronchi developed 21 days post infection. These effects -if sustained- might resemble long-COVID. Respiratory and systemic cellular responses and antibody responses were induced only in animals with an established infection. We conclude that intranasally-infected ferrets resemble asymptomatic COVID-19 and possibly aspects of long-COVID. Combined with the increasing portfolio to measure adaptive immunity, ferrets are a relevant model for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine research.</p>",2021-06-30

Strobel'}],"<p>Site-specific strategies for exchanging segments of dsDNA are important for DNA library construction and molecular tagging. Deoxyuridine (dU) excision is an approach for generating 3’ ssDNA overhangs in gene assembly and molecular cloning procedures. Unlike approaches that use a multi-base pair motif to specify a DNA cut site, dU excision requires only a dT→dU substitution. Consequently, excision sites can be embedded in biologically active DNA sequences by placing dU substitutions at non-perturbative positions. In this work, I describe a molecular tagging method that uses dU excision to exchange a segment of a dsDNA strand with a long synthetic oligonucleotide. The core workflow of this method, called <underline>d</underline>eoxy<underline>U</underline>ridine e<underline>X</underline>cision-tagging (dUX-tagging), is an efficient one-pot reaction: strategically positioned dU nucleotides are excised from dsDNA to generate a 3’ overhang so that additional sequence can be appended by annealing and ligating a tagging oligonucleotide. The tagged DNA is then processed by one of two procedures to fill the 5’ overhang and remove excess tagging oligo. To facilitate its widespread use, all dUX-tagging procedures exclusively use commercially available reagents. As a result, dUX-tagging is a concise and easily implemented approach for high-efficiency linear dsDNA tagging.</p>",2021-06-30
