In humans, however, current approaches either restrict recordings to only a few neurons per penetrating electrode or combine the signals of thousands of neurons in local field potential (LFP) recordings. Here, we describe a set of techniques which enable simultaneous recording from over 200 well-isolated cortical single units in human participants during intraoperative neurosurgical procedures using Neuropixels silicon probes. We characterized a diversity of extracellular waveforms with eight separable single unit classes, with differing firing rates, positions along the length of the linear electrode array, spatial spread of the waveform, and modulation by LFP events such as inter-ictal discharges and burst suppression. While some additional challenges remain in creating a turn-key system capable of recording, Neuropixels technology could pave the way to studying human-specific cognitive processes and their dysfunction at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution.</p>",2021-06-21

B.1.617.2 rapidly replaced B.1.1.7 as the dominant virus in the United Kingdom, resulting in a steep increase in new infections, and a similar development is expected for other countries. Effective countermeasures require information on susceptibility of B.1.617.2 to control by antibodies elicited by vaccines and used for COVID-19 therapy. We show, using pseudotyping, that B.1.617.2 evades control by antibodies induced upon infection and BNT162b2 vaccination, although with lower efficiency as compared to B.1.351. Further, we found that B.1.617.2 is resistant against Bamlanivimab, a monoclonal antibody with emergency use authorization for COVID-19 therapy. Finally, we show increased Calu-3-lung cell entry and enhanced cell-to-cell fusion of B.1.617.2, which may contribute to augmented transmissibility and pathogenicity of this variant. These results identify B.1.617.2 as an immune evasion variant with increased capacity to enter and fuse lung cells.</p>",2021-06-23

Surprisingly, miniature featherwing beetles can fly at speeds and accelerations of insects three times as large [2]. We show here that this performance results from a previously unknown type of wing motion. Our experiment combines three-dimensional reconstructions of morphology and kinematics in one of the smallest insects, <italic>Paratuposa placentis</italic> (body length 395 μm). The flapping bristled wing follows a pronounced figure-eight loop that consists of subperpendicular up and down strokes followed by claps at stroke reversals, above and below the body. Computational analyses suggest a functional decomposition of the flapping cycle in two power half strokes producing a large upward force and two down-dragging recovery half strokes. In contrast to heavier membranous wings, the motion of bristled wings of the same size requires little inertial power. Muscle mechanical power requirements thus remain positive throughout the wing beat cycle, making elastic energy storage obsolete. This novel flight style evolved during miniaturization may compensate for costs associated with air viscosity and helps explain how extremely small insects preserved superb aerial performance during miniaturization. Incorporating this flight style in artificial flappers is a challenge for designers of micro aerial vehicles.</p>",2021-06-25

They include a variety of nuclear and cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) condensates, such as nucleoli, P-bodies, germ granules and stress granules. While is it now recognized that specific RNA and protein families are critical for the biogenesis of RNP condensates, how these molecular constituents determine condensate size and morphology is unknown. To circumvent the biochemical complexity of endogenous RNP condensates, the use of programmable tools to reconstitute condensate formation with minimal constituents can be instrumental. Here we report a methodology to form RNA-containing condensates in living cells with controlled RNA and protein composition. Our bioengineered condensates are made of ArtiGranule scaffolds undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation in cells and programmed to specifically recruit a unique RNA species. We found that RNAs localized on condensate surface, either as isolated RNA molecules or as a homogenous corona of RNA molecules around the condensate. This simplified system allowed us to demonstrate that the size of the condensates scales with RNA surface density, the higher the RNA density is, the smaller and more frequent the condensates are. Our observations suggest a mechanism based on physical constraints, provided by RNAs localized on condensate surface, that limit condensate growth and coalescence.</p>",2021-06-22

It places the emphasis on the viral evolution between, rather than within, hosts. To determine this diversity, we collect SARS-CoV-2 samples from the same patient multiple times. Our own data in conjunction with previous reports show that two viral samples collected from the same individual are often very different due to the substantial within-host diversity. Each sample captures only a small part of the total diversity that is transiently and locally released from infected cells. Hence, the global SARS-CoV-2 population is a meta-population consisting of the viruses in all the infected hosts, each of which harboring a genetically diverse sub-population. Advantageous mutations must be present first as the within-host diversity before they are revealed as between-host polymorphism. The early detection of such diversity in multiple hosts could be an alarm for potentially dangerous mutations. In conclusion, the main forces of viral evolution, i.e., mutation, drift, recombination and selection, all operate within hosts and should be studied accordingly.

The activation of the underlying defence responses can depend on the perception of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). To dissect and understand such variation, we evaluated the diversity of responses induced by laminarin (representing a general glucan elicitor of plant immune responses) in the wild tomato species Solanum chilense. We confirm considerable overlap of the plant's global transcriptional responses to laminarin and to the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans. We further measured key components of basal defence responses such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and levels of diverse phytohormones and their derivatives upon elicitation with laminarin in 83 plants originating from nine natural populations of S. chilense from distinct geographic origin. We found high diversity in these components at basal and elicitor-induced levels. We generated generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) with these components to explain the observed resistance phenotype against P. infestans in the plants and found that additive effects of multiple components best explain resistance at the species level. For individual components, we observed the strongest positive correlation between the resistance phenotype and ethylene (ET) production upon laminarin elicitation. The strength of this correlation differed between individual populations. Chemical inhibition of ET production in individuals from a population, in which ET production was associated with resistance, provoked more severe disease symptoms. Our findings reveal high diversity in the strength of induced defence responses within a species and in the basal levels of other stress-related phytohormones.

We construct a minimalistic regulatory network that captures known associations between regulators of EMT (the epithelial mesenchymal transition) and levels of PD-L1, an established suppressor of immune response, and simulated the network’s emergent dynamics. Our model recapitulates observations that cells undergoing EMT have increased PD-L1 levels, while reverting EMT can decrease these levels, indicative of a causal link between EMT drivers and PD-L1. Further, we show that hybrid E/M cells can have high levels of PD-L1, similar to those seen in cells with a full EMT phenotype, thus obviating the need for cancer cells to undergo a full EMT to evade the immune system. Finally, we identify various signalling pathways and cellular processes that can independently or in concert affect PD-L1 levels and EMT status. For instance, hybrid E/M cells can gain both immune-evasion and stemness through largely independent paths. Our results underscore another underlying reason for the high metastatic ability of hybrid E/M cells.</p>",2021-06-22

Incidence and prevalence of COVID-19 case rates have demonstrated extreme geospatial and temporal variability across the globe. The outbreaks in some countries are extreme and devastating, while other countries face outbreaks that are relatively minor. The causes of these differences between nations remain poorly understood, and identifying the factors that underlie this variation is critical to understand the dynamics of this disease in order to better respond to this and future pandemics.</p><p>Here, we examine four factors that we anticipated would explain much of the variation in COVID-19 rates between nations: median age, obesity rate, island status, and strength of border closure measures. Clinical evidence suggests that age and obesity increase both the likelihood of infection and transmission in individual patients, which make them plausible demographic factors. The third factor, whether or not each country is an island nation, was selected because the geographical isolation of islands is expected to influence COVID-19 transmission.

Krahn'}]","<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> nephrocytes are an emerging model system for mammalian podocytes and podocyte-associated diseases. Like podocytes, nephrocytes exhibit characteristics of epithelial cells, but the role of phospholipids in polarization of these cells is yet unclear. In epithelia phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) are asymmetrically distributed in the plasma membrane and determine apical-basal polarity. Here we demonstrate that both phospholipids are present in the plasma membrane of nephrocytes, but only PI(4,5)P2 accumulates at slit diaphragms. Knockdown of Skittles, a phosphatidylinositol(4)phosphate 5-kinase, which produces PI(4,5)P2, abolished slit diaphragm formation and led to strongly reduced endocytosis. Notably, reduction in PI(3,4,5)P3 by overexpression of PTEN or expression of a dominant-negative phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase did not affect nephrocyte function, whereas enhanced formation of PI(3,4,5)P3 by constitutively active phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase resulted in strong slit diaphragm and endocytosis defects by ectopic activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway. Thus, PI(4,5)P2 but not PI(3,4,5)P3 is essential for slit diaphragm formation and nephrocyte function. However, PI(3,4,5)P3 has to be tightly controlled to ensure nephrocyte development.</p>",2021-06-22

Brüning'}]","<p>Natural killer (NK) cells contribute to the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance and have previously been shown to up-regulate the expression of the P2Y purinoreceptor 6 (P2Y6R) upon high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Here, we reveal that NK cell-specific inactivation of the P2Y6R gene improves insulin sensitivity in obese mice and reduces the expression of chemokines in adipose tissue infiltrating NK-cells. Obese mice lacking P2Y6R specifically in NK cells exhibited a reduction in adipose tissue inflammation, exhibited improved insulin-stimulated suppression of lipolysis in adipose tissue and a reduction in hepatic glucose production, leading to an overall improvement of systemic insulin sensitivity. In contrast, myeloid lineage specific P2Y6R inactivation does not affect energy or glucose homeostasis in obesity. Collectively, we show that P2Y6R signaling in NK cells contributes to the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance and thus might be a future target for the treatment of obesity-associated insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.</p>",2021-06-24

The gold standard reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) cannot keep up with the high demand alone, therefore alternative diagnostic tests are needed. Here we present ADESSO (Accurate Detection of Evolving SARS-CoV-2 through SHERLOCK Optimisation), an optimised version of the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter unLOCKing) assay. After an extensive validation on 983 clinical samples, we demonstrated that ADESSO has a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 100% on extracted RNA, comparable to RT-qPCR. Its performance on unextracted samples still allows the detection of the more infectious 75% of the COVID-19 positive population, making it suitable for point-of-care (POC) testing. Interestingly, our in parallel comparison of 390 matching swab and gargle samples showed consistently lower viral loads in gargle specimens. We also validated ADESSO for the detection of the B.1.1.7 variant and demonstrated that ADESSO is adaptable to any variant of concern in less than one week, a critical feature now that worrisome SARS-CoV-2 variants are spreading all around the world.</p>",2021-06-22

The CLAVATA pathway is a key regulator of stem cell function in the multicellular shoot tips of Arabidopsis, acting via the WUSCHEL transcription factor to modulate hormone homeostasis. Broad scale evolutionary comparisons have shown that CLAVATA is a conserved regulator of land plant stem cell function, but CLAVATA acts independently of WUSCHEL-like (WOX) proteins in bryophytes, raising questions about the evolution of stem cell function and the role of the CLAVATA pathway. Here we show that the moss (Physcomitrella) CLAVATA pathway affects stem cell activity and overall plant shape by modulating hormone homeostasis. CLAVATA pathway components are expressed in the tip cells of filamentous tissues, regulating cell identity, filament branching patterns and plant spread. The PpRPK2 receptor-like kinase plays the major role and is expressed more strongly than other receptor-encoding genes. Pprpk2 mutants have abnormal responses to cytokinin, and auxin transport inhibition and show reduced PIN auxin transporter expression. We propose a model whereby PpRPK2 modulates PIN activity to determine stem cell identity and overall plant form in Physcomitrella. Our data indicate that CLAVATA-mediated auxin homeostasis is a fundamental property of plant stem cell function likely exhibited by the last shared common ancestor of land plants.</p>",2021-06-25
