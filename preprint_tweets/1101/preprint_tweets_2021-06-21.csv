Here we present Repair-seq, a high-throughput screening approach that measures the effects of thousands of genetic perturbations on the distribution of mutations introduced at targeted DNA lesions. Using Repair-seq, we profiled DSB repair outcomes induced by two programmable nucleases (Cas9 and Cas12a) after knockdown of 476 genes involved in DSB repair or associated processes in the presence or absence of oligonucleotides for homology-directed repair (HDR). The resulting data enabled principled, data-driven inference of DSB end joining and HDR pathways and demonstrated that repair outcomes with superficially similar sequence architectures can have markedly different genetic dependencies. Systematic interrogation of these dependencies then uncovered unexpected relationships among DSB repair genes and isolated incompletely characterized repair mechanisms. This work provides a foundation for understanding the complex pathways of DSB repair and for optimizing genome editing across modalities.</p>",2021-06-14

We measured viral load in 950 individuals and found that infections with variant Alpha exhibit a higher viral load and longer viral shedding compared to non-VOC. We then used a transmission model to analyze the spread of variant Alpha in Geneva, Switzerland, and variant Beta in South Africa. We estimated that Alpha is either associated with a 37% (95% compatibility interval, CI: 25–63%) increase in transmissibility or a 51% (95% CI: 32–80%) increase of the infectious duration, or a combination of the two mechanisms. Assuming 50% immune evasion for Beta, we estimated a 23% (95% CI: 10–37%) increase in transmissibility or a 38% (95% CI: 15–78%) increase of the infectious duration for this variant. Beta is expected to outgrow Alpha in regions where the level of naturally acquired immunity from previously circulating variants exceeds 20% to 40%.

Different pathways are specialized in so far as they use representations that are more suitable for supporting specific downstream behaviours. In particular, the clearest example is the specialization of the ventral ('what') and dorsal ('where') pathways of the visual cortex. These two pathways support behaviours related to visual recognition and movement, respectively. To-date, deep neural networks have mostly been used as models of the ventral, recognition pathway. However, it is unknown whether both pathways can be modelled with a single deep ANN. Here, we ask whether a single model with a single loss function can capture the properties of both the ventral and the dorsal pathways. We explore this question using data from mice, who like other mammals, have specialized pathways that appear to support recognition and movement behaviours. We show that when we train a deep neural network architecture with two parallel pathways using a self-supervised predictive loss function, we can outperform other models in fitting mouse visual cortex. Moreover, we can model both the dorsal and ventral pathways. These results demonstrate that a self-supervised predictive learning approach applied to parallel pathway architectures can account for some of the functional specialization seen in mammalian visual systems.</p>",2021-06-18

We found that place cell propensities to form fields were proportional to open-field area, gamma-distributed, and conserved across environments. The properties of place fields varied positionally with a denser distribution of smaller fields near boundaries. Remarkably, the variation in field sizes and densities exactly countered each other, such that the population-level statistics were constant both within and between environments.

Here we demonstrate a new method to visualize endogenous genomic loci using synthetic zinc-finger proteins harboring repeat epitope tags (ZF probes) for signal amplification via binding of tag-specific intracellular antibodies, or frankenbodies, fused with fluorescent proteins. We achieve this in two steps. First, we develop an anti-FLAG frankenbody that can bind FLAG-tagged proteins in diverse live-cell environments. The anti-FLAG frankenbody complements the anti-HA frankenbody, enabling two-color signal amplification from FLAG and HA-tagged proteins. Second, we develop a pair of cell-permeable ZF probes that specifically bind two endogenous chromatin loci predicted to be involved in chromatin looping. By coupling our anti-FLAG and anti-HA frankenbodies with FLAG- and HA-tagged ZF probes, we simultaneously visualize the dynamics of the two loci in single living cells. This reveals close association between the two loci in the majority of cells, but the loci markedly separate upon the triggered degradation of the cohesin subunit RAD21. Our ability to image two endogenous genomic loci simultaneously in single living cells provides a proof-of-principle that ZF probes coupled with frankenbodies are useful new tools for exploring genome dynamics in multiple colors.</p>",2021-06-16

Event segmentation has been studied extensively in adults, but little is known about how the youngest minds experience the world. The main impediment to studying event segmentation in infants has been a reliance on explicit parsing tasks that are not possible at this age. fMRI has recently proven successful at measuring adult event segmentation during task-free, naturalistic perception. Applied to infants, this could reveal the nature of their event segmentation, from low-level sensory transients to high-level cognitive boundaries. We collected fMRI data from 25 adults and 25 infants less than one year of age watching the same short movie. Neural events were defined by the stability of voxel activity patterns. In adults, we replicated a hierarchical gradient of event timescales, from shorter events in early visual regions to longer events in later visual and narrative regions. In infants, however, longer events were found throughout the brain, including in a second dataset. Infant event structure fit adult data and vice versa, but adult behavioral boundaries were differently expressed in adult and infant brains.

Past research has revealed a genetic haplotype on chromosome 3 that entered the human population via introgression from Neanderthals as the strongest genetic risk factor for the severe COVID-19 phenotype. However, the specific variants along this introgressed haplotype that contribute to this risk and the biological mechanisms that are involved remain unclear. Here, we assess the variants present on the risk haplotype for their likelihood of driving the severe COVID-19 phenotype. We do this by first exploring their impact on the regulation of genes involved in COVID-19 infection using a variety of population genetics and functional genomics tools. We then perform an locus-specific massively parallel reporter assay to individually assess the regulatory potential of each allele on the haplotype in a multipotent immune-related cell line. We ultimately reduce the set of over 600 linked genetic variants to identify 4 introgressed alleles that are strong functional candidates for driving the association between this locus and severe COVID-19. These variants likely drive the locus’ impact on severity by putatively modulating the regulation of two critical chemokine receptor genes: <italic>CCR1</italic> and <italic>CCR5</italic>.

Cancerous invadopodia and myelomonocytic podosomes are widely considered as structural tools facilitating these processes and are thus summarized under the term invadosomes. Despite similar behaviour on the individual scale, substantial differences have been reported to arise on the collective scale. They are considered to be a result of podosome mesoscale-connectivity. In this study, we investigated global in-plane and out-of-plane mechanical forces of podosome clusters in ER-Hoxb8 cell derived monocytes. We are able to correlate these forces with the interpodosomal connectivity. The observed traction and protrusion patterns fail to be explained by summation of single podosome mechanics. Instead, they appear to originate from superimposed mesoscale effects. Based on mechanistic and morphological similarities with epithelial monolayer mechanics, we propose a spatiotemporal model of podosome cluster mechanics capable of relating single to collective podosome mechanical behaviour. Our results suggest that network contraction-driven (in-plane) tractions lead to a buckling instability that contributes to the out-of-plane indentation into the substrate.  First assigning an active mechanical role to the dorsal podosome actomyosin network, we aim at translating actomyosin hierarchy into scale dependency of podosome mechanics.</p>",2021-06-18

The ribosomal catalytic site, the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), is targeted by a large number of various drugs. The classical and best-studied PTC-acting antibiotic chloramphenicol, as well as the newest clinically significant linezolid, were considered indiscriminate inhibitors of every round of peptide bond formation, presumably inhibiting protein synthesis by stalling ribosomes at every codon of every gene being translated. However, it was recently discovered that chloramphenicol or linezolid, and many other PTC-targeting drugs, preferentially arrest translation when the ribosome needs to polymerize particular amino acid sequences. The molecular mechanisms and structural bases that underlie this phenomenon of context-specific action of even the most basic ribosomal antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol, are unknown. Here we present high-resolution structures of ribosomal complexes, with or without chloramphenicol, carrying specific nascent peptides that support or negate the drug action. Our data suggest that specific amino acids in the nascent chains directly modulate the antibiotic affinity to the ribosome by either establishing specific interactions with the drug molecule or obstructing its placement in the binding site. The model that emerged from our studies rationalizes the critical importance of the penultimate residue of a growing peptide for the ability of the drug to stall translation and provides the first atomic-level understanding of context specificity of antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis by acting upon the PTC.</p>",2021-06-18

The golden (Syrian) hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection recapitulates key characteristics of severe COVID-19, including high-titer viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract and the development of pathogenic lesions in the lungs. In this work we examined the influence of the route of exposure, sex, and age on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in golden hamsters. We report that delivery of SARS-CoV-2 primarily to the nasal passages (low-volume intranasal), the upper and lower respiratory tract (high-volume intranasal), or the digestive tract (intragastric) results in comparable viral titers in the lung tissue and similar levels of viral shedding during acute infection. However, low-volume intranasal exposure results in milder weight loss during acute infection while intragastric exposure leads to a diminished capacity to regain body weight following the period of acute illness. Further, we examined both sex and age differences in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male hamsters, and to a greater extent older male hamsters, display an impaired capacity to recover from illness and a delay in viral clearance compared to females. Lastly, route of exposure, sex, and age were found to influence the nature of the host inflammatory cytokine response, but they had a minimal effect on both the quality and durability of the humoral immune response as well as the susceptibility of hamsters to SARS-CoV-2 re-infection.

Serial nasal epithelial lining fluid (NELF) and peripheral blood samples were collected in ten subjects who had received CoronaVac and thirty-two subjects who had received Comirnaty. We quantified IgA and IgG specific to SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein by ELISA in NELF and plasma samples. The neutralization effect of these two sample types were evaluated by surrogate ACE-SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein ELISA.

RNA synthesis is mediated by the RdRp active site that is conserved among all RNA viruses and has been a focus of mechanistic studies and drug discovery. The second active site resides in a Nidovirus RdRp-Associated Nucleotidyl transferase (NiRAN) domain. Both catalytic reactions are essential for viral replication, but the mechanism and targets of NiRAN are poorly characterized. One recent study showed that NiRAN transfers NMP to the first residue of RNA-binding protein Nsp9. Another study reported a structure of SARS-CoV-2 replicase with an extended Nsp9 in the NiRAN active site but observed NMP transfer to RNA instead. We show that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp12 efficiently and reversibly NMPylates the native but not the extended Nsp9. Substitutions of the invariant NiRAN residues abolish NMPylation, whereas a substitution of a catalytic RdRp Asp residue does not. NMPylation is inhibited by nucleotide analogs, pyrophosphate, and bisphosphonates, suggesting a path for rational design of NiRAN inhibitors. We hypothesize that Nsp9 remodels both active sites of Nsp12 to support initiation of RNA synthesis by RdRp and subsequent capping of the product RNA by the NiRAN domain.</p>",2021-06-14

However, a complementary prediction has been less well explored, namely that the cortical locus of declarative memory may fall outside the MTL if the to-be-remembered content is sufficiently simple. Specifically, the locus should coincide with the optimal neural code for the representations being retrieved. To test this prediction, we manipulated the complexity of the to-be-remembered representations in a recognition memory task. First, participants in the scanner viewed novel 3D objects and scenes, and we used multivariate analyses to identify regions in the ventral visual-MTL pathway that preferentially coded for either simple features of the stimuli, or complex conjunctions of those features. Next, in a separate scan, we tested recognition memory for these stimuli and performed neuroimaging contrasts that revealed two memory signals ‒ feature memory and conjunction memory. Feature memory signals were found in visual cortex, while conjunction memory signals emerged in MTL. Further, the regions optimally representing features via preferential feature-coding coincided with those exhibiting feature memory signals.

Substantial evidence now supports this prediction. However, the complementary prediction ‒ that declarative memory should engage areas outside of MTL if the stimuli are sufficiently simple ‒ is less thoroughly explored.

Alca Tarma, the terminal arm of chromosome 4 translocated to the tip of chromosome 1. Using oligonucleotide-based fluorescent in situ hybridization painting probes (oligo-FISH), we tested and confirmed the predicted arrangement in PI 310467. In 192 natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, dosage haplotypes tended to vary continuously and resulted in higher noise, while LD between pericentromeric regions suggested the effect of repeats. This method should be useful in species where translocations are suspected because it tests linkage without the need for genotyping.</p>",2021-06-18

The high-quality assembly encompassed more than 598 Megabases (Mb) assigned to 1 594 scaffolds (scaffold N50 = 25 Mb) with 96 % of its total length distributed among 24 chromosomes. The investigation of its syntenic relationships with other economically important flatfish species revealed a high conservation of synteny blocks among members of this phylogenetic clade. Sex determination analysis revealed that flatfishes do not escape the rule applied to other teleost fish and exhibit a high level of plasticity and turnover in sex-determination mechanisms. A whole-genome sequence analysis of 198 individuals allowed us to draw a full picture of the molecular sex determination (SD) system for Greenland Halibut, revealing that this species possesses a very nascent male heterogametic XY system, with a putative major effect of the sox2 gene, also described as the main SD driver in two other flatfishes. Interestingly, our study also suggested for the first time in flatfishes that a putative Y-autosomal fusion could be associated with a reduction of recombination typical of early steps of sex chromosome evolution.</p>",2021-06-20

Indeed, efficient activation of macroautophagy upon nutritional deprivation is sustained by degradation of preexisting proteins by the proteasome. However, the specific substrates that are degraded by the proteasome in order to activate macroautophagy are currently unknown. By quantitative proteomic analysis we identified several proteins downregulated in response to starvation but independently of ATG5 expression. Among them, the most significant was HERPUD1, an ER protein of short-half life and a well-known substrate of the proteasome. We found that increased HERPUD1 stability by deletion of its ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) plays a negative role on basal and induced macroautophagy. Moreover, we found it triggers ER expansion by reordering the ER in crystalloid structures, but in the absence of unfolded protein response activation. Surprisingly, we found ER expansion led to an increase in the number and function of lysosomes establishing a tight network with the presence of membrane-contact sites. Importantly, a phosphomimetic S59D mutation within the UBL mimics UBL deletion on its stability and the ER-lysosomal network expansion revealing an increase of cell survival under stress conditions. Altogether, we propose stabilized HERPUD1 downregulates macroautophagy favoring instead a closed interplay between the ER and lysosomes with consequences in cell stress survival.</p><sec><title>Abstract Figure</title><fig id=""ufig1"" position=""float"" orientation=""portrait"" fig-type=""figure""><graphic xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""447273v1_ufig1"" position=""float"" orientation=""portrait"" /></fig></sec>",2021-06-14

Therefore, there is currently a need for virus classification tools based on such shared genes / proteins. Here, VirClust is presented – a novel tool capable of performing i) hierarchical clustering of viruses based on intergenomic distances calculated from their protein cluster content, ii) identification of core proteins and iii) annotation of viral proteins.

Furthermore, VirClust provides an integrated visualization of the hierarchical clustering tree and of the distribution of the protein content, which allows the identification of the genomic features responsible for the respective clustering. By using different intergenomic distances, the hierarchical trees produced by VirClust can be split into viral genome clusters of different taxonomic ranks.

Ross'}]","<p>Cerebral palsy results from an upper motor neuron lesion and has significant effects on skeletal muscle stiffness throughout the body. The increased stiffness that occurs is partly a result of changes in the microstructural components of muscle. In particular, alterations in extracellular matrix, sarcomere length, fibre diameter, and fat content have been reported; however, experimental studies have shown wide variability in the degree to which each component is altered. Many studies have reported alterations in the extracellular matrix, while others have reported no changes. A consistent finding throughout the literature is increased sarcomere length in cerebral palsy muscle. Often more than one component is altered, making it difficult to determine the individual effects on stiffness. The purpose of this study is to use a modeling approach to isolate individual effects of microstructural alterations that typically occur during cerebral palsy on whole muscle behavior; in particular, the extracellular matrix volume fraction, stiffness, and sarcomere length. These microstructural effects can be captured using a three dimensional model of muscle. We found that the extracellular matrix volume fraction has a larger effect on stiffness compared to sarcomere length, even when coupled with decreased extracellular matrix stiffness. Additionally, the effects of sarcomere length in passive stiffness are mitigated by the increased extracellular matrix volume fraction. Using this model, we can achieve a better understanding of the possible combinations of microstructural changes that can occur during cerebral palsy.
