Each myofiber contains periodic myofibrils built by hundreds of contractile sarcomeres that generate large mechanical forces. To better understand the mechanisms that coordinate human muscle morphogenesis from tissue to molecular scales, we adopted a simple <italic>in vitro</italic> system using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human myogenic precursors. When grown on an unrestricted two-dimensional substrate, developing myofibers spontaneously align and self-organise into higher-order myofiber bundles, which grow and consolidate to stable sizes. Following a transcriptional boost of sarcomeric components, myofibrils assemble into chains of periodic sarcomeres that emerge across the entire myofiber. By directly probing tension we found that tension build-up precedes sarcomere assembly and increases within each assembling myofibril. Furthermore, we found that myofiber ends stably attach to other myofibers using integrin-based attachments and thus myofiber bundling coincides with stable myofiber bundle attachment <italic>in vitro</italic>. A failure in stable myofiber attachment results in a collapse followed by a disassembly of the myofibrils. Overall, our results strongly suggest that mechanical tension across sarcomeric components as well as between differentiating myofibers is key to coordinate the multi- scale self-organisation of muscle morphogenesis.</p>",2021-10-25

Conversely, variants that cause rare Mendelian diseases are often coding and have a more direct impact on disease development. We demonstrate that common and rare genetic diseases can be linked by studying the gene regulatory networks impacted by common disease-associated variants. We implemented this in the ‘Downstreamer’ method and applied it to 44 GWAS traits and find that predicted downstream “key genes” are enriched with Mendelian disease genes, e.g. key genes for height are enriched for genes that cause skeletal abnormalities and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. We find that 82% of these key genes are located outside of GWAS loci, suggesting that they result from complex <italic>trans</italic> regulation rather than being impacted by disease-associated variants in <italic>cis</italic>.

LPS is recognised by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in innate immunity. Here, we showed that LPS binds to multiple hydrophobic pockets spanning both the S1 and S2 subunits of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. LPS binds to the S2 pocket with a lower affinity compared to S1, suggesting its possible role as an intermediate in the TLR4 cascade. Congruently, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation in vitro is strongly boosted by S2. In vivo, however, a boosting effect is observed for both S1 and S2, with the former potentially facilitated by proteolysis. Collectively, our study suggests the S protein may act as a delivery system for LPS in host innate immune pathways. The LPS binding pockets are highly conserved across different SARS-CoV-2 variants and therefore represent potential therapeutic targets.</p>",2021-10-29

Whilst often considered a respiratory disease, a large proportion of COVID-19 patients report neurological symptoms, and there is accumulating evidence for neural damage in some individuals, with recent studies suggesting loss of gray matter in multiple regions, particularly in the left hemisphere. There are a number of mechanisms by which COVID-19 infection may lead to neurological symptoms and structural and functional changes in the brain, and it is reasonable to expect that many of these may translate into cognitive problems. Indeed, cognitive problems are one of the most commonly reported symptoms in those suffering from “Long COVID”—the chronic illness following COVID-19 infection that affects between 10–25% of sufferers. The COVID and Cognition Study is a part cross-sectional, part longitudinal, study documenting and aiming to understand the cognitive problems in Long COVID. In this first paper from the study, we document the characteristics of our sample of 181 individuals who had suffered COVID-19 infection, and 185 who had not. We explore which factors may be predictive of ongoing symptoms and their severity, as well as conducting an in-depth analysis of symptom profiles. Finally, we explore which factors predict the presence and severity of cognitive symptoms, both throughout the ongoing illness and at the time of testing. The main finding from this first analysis is that that severity of initial illness is a significant predictor of the presence and severity of ongoing symptoms, and that some symptoms during the acute illness—particularly limb weakness—may be more common in those that have more severe ongoing symptoms. Symptom profiles can be well described in terms of 5 or 6 factors, reflecting the variety of this highly heterogenous condition suffered by the individual. Specifically, we found that neurological and fatigue symptoms during the initial illness, and that neurological, gastro-intestinal, and cardiopulmonary symptoms during the ongoing illness, predicted experience of cognitive symptoms.</p>",2021-10-26

Currently, this mutation, which is expressed on different SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating worldwide, has not been thoughtfully investigated. Therefore, we performed phylogenetic and biocomputational analysis to better understand SARS-CoV-2 Q675H mutants evolutionary relationships with other circulating lineages and Q675H function in its molecular context. Our studies reveal that Q675H spike mutation is the result of parallel evolution because it arose independently in separate evolutionary clades. In silico data show that the Q675H mutation gives rise to a hydrogen-bonds network in the spike polar region delimiting the conformational space of the highly flexible loop containing the furin cleavage site. This results in an optimized directionality of arginine residues involved in interaction of spike with the furin binding pocket, thus improving proteolytic exposure of the viral protein. Furin was found to have a greater affinity for Q675H than Q675 substrate conformations. As a consequence, Q675H mutation is likely to confer a fitness advantage to SARS-CoV-2 by promoting a more efficient viral entry. Interestingly, here we show an ongoing increase in the occurrence of Q675H spike mutation in the most common SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC). This finding highlights that, VOC are still evolving and start acquiring the Q675H mutation. At the same time, it suggests that our hypothesis of fitness advantage prompted by Q675H could be concrete.</p>",2021-10-29

Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to worse outcome in cancer patients, especially in haematological malignancy patients. Here, we investigated how SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts the already altered CCG levels in solid or haematological malignancies, specifically whether there is a protective effect or rather a potentially higher risk for major COVID-19 complications in cancer patients due to elevated CCGs linked to cancer progression. Serially analysing immune responses with 55 CCGs in cancer patients under active treatment with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection, we first showed that cancer patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=54) demonstrate elevated levels of 35 CCGs compared to the non-cancer, non-infected control group of health care workers (n=42). Of the 35 CCGs, 19 were common to both solid and haematological malignancy groups and comprised previously described cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1Ra, IL-17A, and VEGF, but also several less well described cytokines/chemokines such as Fractalkine, Tie-2, and T cell chemokine CTACK. Importantly, we show here that 7 CCGs are significantly altered in SARS-CoV-2 exposed cancer patients (n=52). Of these TNF-α, IFN-β, TSLP and sVCAM-1, identified to be elevated in haematological cancers, are also known tumour-promoting factors. Longitudinal analysis conducted over 3 months showed persistence of several tumour-promoting CCGs in SARS-CoV-2 exposed cancer patients. These data urge for increased vigilance for haematological malignancy patients as a part of long COVID follow-up.</p>",2021-10-29

Most OMPs have a diagnostic β-signal imprinted in the amino acid sequence of the final β-strand (-1 strand) of the β barrel. Molecular chaperones of the Omp85 superfamily, such as BamA in the bacterial BAM complex, recognizes the β-signal and then catalyze the folding of the OMP into its membrane-embedded β barrel structure. Here, we reconstituted OMP assembly in vitro to study this process with five model OMPs, revealing that a critical assembly signal exists in the fifth β-strand from the C-terminus (-5 strand). This signal was shown to drive a critical insertion step of the OMP assembly process but is not required for the initial recognition step between the OMP and BamA. Furthermore, we identified the receptor for this -5 signal as BamD, a second essential subunit of the BAM complex. Distinct binding sites for the β-signal and the -5 signal, were identified on BamD. Comparative sequence analysis showed that the -5 signal is a conserved feature in bacterial OMPs, and that mitochondrial OMPs also contains -5 signal motif positioned in the fifth from last strand of their β barrel structure. We propose the -5 rule as a conserved feature of the process of OMP assembly in bacteria and the organelles of eukaryotes.</p>",2021-10-29

Lengthwise DNA compaction by condensin is facilitated by ATPase-driven loop extrusion, a process that is believed to be the fundamental activity of most, if not all SMC complexes. In order to obtain molecular insights, we obtained cryo-EM structures of yeast condensin in the presence of a slowly-hydrolysable ATP analogue and linear, as well as circular DNAs. The DNAs were shown to be clamped between the engaged heterodimeric SMC ATPase heads and the Ycs4 subunit, in a manner similar to previously reported DNA-bound SMC complex structures. Ycg1, the other non-SMC subunit was only flexibly bound to the complex, while also binding DNA tightly, and often remaining at a distance from the head module. In the clamped state, the DNA is encircled, or topologically entrapped, by the kleisin Brn1 and the two engaged head domains of Smc2 and Smc4, and this tripartite ring is closed at all interfaces, including at the neck of Smc2. We show that the neck gate opens upon head engagement in the absence of DNA, but it remains shut when DNA is present. Our work demonstrates that condensin and other SMC complexes go through similar conformations of the head modules during their ATPase cycle. In contrast, the behaviour of the Ycg1 subunit in the condensin complex might indicate differences in the implementation of the extrusion reactions and our findings will constrain further mechanistic models of loop extrusion by SMC complexes.</p>",2021-10-29

We report that FG-nucleoporins in the bleb lumen undergo phase separation and contribute to DYT1 dystonia by provoking two proteotoxic insults. Short-lived ubiquitinated proteins that are normally rapidly degraded in healthy cells partition into the bleb lumen and become stabilized. Additionally, blebs selectively sequester a chaperone network composed of HSP70s and HSP40s. The composition of this chaperone network is altered by the bleb component MLF2.

Zygotic or embryonic genome activation (ZGA, EGA) in the 2-cell embryo in mouse, and the 8-cell embryo in humans, constitutes the first major wave of transcription. Failure to initiate ZGA leads to developmental defects, and contributes to the high attrition rates of human pre-implantation embryos. Due to limitations in cell numbers and experimental tractability, the mechanisms that regulate human embryonic genome activation in the totipotent embryo remain poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of human 8-cell like cells (8CLCs) specifically among naive embryonic stem cells, but not primed pluripotent cells. 8CLCs express ZGA marker genes such as ZSCAN4, LEUTX and DUXA and their transcriptome closely resembles that of the 8-cell human embryo. 8-cell like cells reactivate 8-cell stage specific transposable elements such as HERVL and MLT2A1 and are characterized by upregulation of the DNA methylation regulator DPPA3. 8CLCs show reduced SOX2 protein, and can be identified based on expression of the novel ZGA-associated protein markers TPRX1 and H3.Y in vitro. Overexpression of the transcription factor DUX4 as well as spliceosome inhibition increase ZGA-like transcription and enhance TPRX1+ 8CLCs formation. Excitingly, the in vitro identified 8CLC marker proteins TPRX1 and H3.Y are also expressed in 8-cell human embryos at the time of genome activation and may thus be relevant in vivo. The discovery of 8CLCs provides a unique opportunity to model and manipulate human ZGA-like transcriptional programs in vitro, and might provide critical functional insights into one of the earliest events in human embryogenesis in vivo.</p>",2021-10-29

While great strides have been made in elucidating molecular and cellular events that drive NCC specification, comprehensive knowledge of the genetic factors that orchestrate NCC developmental programs is still far from complete. We discovered that elevated Hoxb5b levels promoted an expansion of zebrafish NCCs, which persisted throughout multiple stages of development. Correspondingly, elevated Hoxb5b also specifically expanded expression domains of the vagal NCC markers foxd3 and phox2bb. Increases in NCCs were most apparent after pulsed ectopic Hoxb5b expression at early developmental stages, rather than later during differentiation stages, as determined using a novel transgenic zebrafish line. The increase in vagal NCCs early in development led to supernumerary Phox2b+ enteric neural progenitors, while leaving many other NCC-derived tissues without an overt phenotype. Surprisingly, these NCC-derived enteric progenitors failed to expand properly into sufficient quantities of enterically fated neurons and stalled in the gut tissue. These results suggest that while Hoxb5b participates in vagal NCC development as a driver of progenitor expansion, the supernumerary, ectopically localized NCC fail to initiate expansion programs in timely fashion in the gut.  All together, these data point to a model in which Hoxb5b regulates NCCs both in a tissue specific and temporally restricted manner.</p>",2021-10-29

However, it is unknown whether these structures are evolutionarily conserved, capable of stress-inducible gene activation or involved in 3D genome reorganization. Here, we identify inducible transcriptional condensates in the yeast heat shock response (HSR). HSR condensates are biophysically dynamic spatiotemporal clusters of the sequence-specific transcription factor Heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) with Mediator and RNA Pol II. Uniquely, HSR condensates drive the coalescence of multiple Hsf1 target genes, even those located on different chromosomes. Binding of the chaperone Hsp70 to a site on Hsf1 represses clustering, while an intrinsically disordered region on Hsf1 promotes condensate formation and intergenic interactions. Mutation of both Hsf1 determinants reprograms HSR condensates to become mammalian-like: constitutively active without intergenic coalescence.

An important problem is posed by the consumption of signaling molecules upon circuit interconnection, which makes it possible to control a downstream circuit but compromises the performance of the upstream circuit. This issue has been previously addressed with insulation strategies including high-gain negative feedback and phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reaction cycle. In this paper, we focus on RNA-based circuits and propose a new positive-feedback insulation strategy to mitigate signal consumption. An RNA input is added in tandem with transcription output to compensate the RNA consumption, leading to concentration robustness of the input RNA molecule regardless of the amount of downstream modules. We term this strategy RNA compensation, and it can be applied to systems that have a stringent input-output gain, such as Small Transcription Activating RNAs (STARs).

This study addressed knowledge gaps about what the values of m and g1 are in C4 crops under field conditions, as well as how they vary among genotypes and with drought stress. m and g1 were unexpectedly consistent in four inbred maize genotypes across a gradient of water supply. This was despite genotypic variation in stomatal patterning, A and gs. m and g1 were strongly correlated with soil water content, moderately correlated with pre-dawn leaf water potential (Ψpd), and weakly correlated with midday leaf water potential (Ψmd). This implied that m and g1 respond to long-term water supply more than short-term drought stress. The conserved nature of m and g1 across anatomically diverse genotypes and water supplies suggests there is flexibility in structure-function relationships underpinning WUE. This evidence can guide simulation of maize gs across a range of water supply in the primary maize growing region and inform efforts to improve WUE.</p>",2021-10-29

Methods and findings: We carried out a multi-tissue (nasal, buccal and blood; n = 156) gene expression analysis of immune-related genes from patients affected by different COVID-19 severities, and healthy controls through the nCounter technology. We then used a differential expression approach and pathways analysis to detect tissue specific immune severity signals in COVID-19 patients. Mild and asymptomatic cases showed a powerful innate antiviral response in nasal epithelium, characterized by activation of interferon (IFN) pathway and downstream cascades, successfully controlling the infection at local level. In contrast, weak macrophage/monocyte driven innate antiviral response and lack of IFN signalling activity were shown in severe cases. Consequently, oral mucosa from severe patients showed signals of viral activity, cell arresting and viral dissemination to the lower respiratory tract, which ultimately could explain the exacerbated innate immune response and impaired adaptative immune responses observed at systemic level. Results from saliva transcriptome suggest that the buccal cavity might play a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and dissemination in patients with worse prognosis. Conclusions: We found severity-related signatures in patient tissues mainly represented by genes involved in the innate immune system and cytokine/chemokine signalling.

Participants: Patients &lt;18 years of age hospitalized with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, including PCR-positive multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)
Exposures: Variables assessed for their association with disease severity included patient demographics, presence of comorbidities, clinical manifestations, laboratory parameters and chest imaging findings.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was severe disease defined as a WHO COVID-19 clinical progression scale of ≥6, i.e., requirement of non-invasive ventilation, high flow nasal cannula, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or death. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with severe disease.
Results: We identified 403 hospitalizations. Median age was 3.78 years (IQR 0.53-10.77). At least one comorbidity was present in 46.4% (187/403) and multiple comorbidities in 18.6% (75/403).

While classically used to treat epilepsy and depression, more recently VNS has received FDA approval as a therapeutic option for stroke rehabilitation and is under preclinical and clinical investigation for other disorders. Despite benefits across a diverse range of neurological disorders, the mechanism for how VNS influences central nervous system circuitry is not well described. A deeper understanding of the influence of VNS on neural circuits and activity is needed to optimize the use of VNS therapy. To define the complex dynamics between VNS, neuronal activity, plasticity, and behavior, we performed chronic VNS in mice during the learning of a dexterous motor task, and leveraged genetic tools to perform optogenetic circuit dissection and longitudinal in vivo imaging calcium activity in cortical neurons. We find VNS has the most robust effect on motor learning when paired with successful movement outcome, while randomized stimulation impairs learning, consistent with VNS serving as a reinforcement cue. In motor cortex, VNS paired with movement outcome selectively modulates neurons that are representing outcome, but not other movement-related neurons. Finally, cholinergic signaling from basal forebrain is required both for VNS-driven improvements in motor learning and the effects on neural activity in M1. This suggests that the effect of VNS on motor learning is mediated by cholinergic signaling, and also presents a novel role for cholinergic signaling in endogenous motor learning. These data imply that VNS therapy may be mediated by augmenting reinforcement cues with precisely-timed cholinergic neuronal activity, presenting strategies for optimizing the use of VNS to treat neurologic conditions.</p>",2021-10-29

A solution to address this issue is to integrate existing epigenetic data across cells and tissue types to develop a species-level consensus map relating genes to TADs. Here, we introduce the TAD Map, a bag-of-genes representation that we use to infer, or ""impute"", TAD architectures for those cells/tissues with limited Hi-C experimental data. The TAD Map enables a systematic analysis of gene coexpression induced by chromatin structure. By overlaying transcriptional data from hundreds of bulk and single-cell assays onto the TAD Map, we assess gene coexpression in TADs and find that expressed genes cluster into fewer TADs than would be expected by chance, and show that time-course and RNA velocity studies further reveal this clustering to be strongest in the early stages of cell differentiation; it is also strong in tumor cells. We provide a probabilistic model to summarize any scRNA-seq transcriptome in terms of its TAD activation profile, which we term a TAD signature, and demonstrate its value for cell type inference, cell fate prediction, and multimodal synthesis. More broadly, our work indicates that the TAD Map's comprehensive, quantitative integration of chromatin structure and scRNA-seq data should play a key role in epigenetic and transcriptomic analyses.

We quantified differential expected genetic contributions of males and females over time, showing the impact of sex-biased dispersal in a monogamous system. Due to female-biased dispersal, more autosomal variation is introduced by female immigrants. However, due to male-biased transmission, more Z variation is introduced by male immigrants. Finally, we partitioned the proportion of variance in allele frequency change through time due to male and female contributions. Overall, most allele frequency change is due to variance in survival and births.

Herein we identified BACH1 as a target of CDDO-derivatives, but not CDDO. While both CDDO and CDDO-derivatives activate NRF2 similarly, only CDDO-derivatives inhibit BACH1, which explains the much higher potency of CDDO-derivatives as HMOX1 inducers compared with unmodified CDDO.

The possibility to do so is a strength of samples such as the AGDS. Our results suggest that analyses can be made more robust by identifying attrition biases both on the phenotypic and genetic level, and either contextualising them as a potential limitation or performing sensitivity analyses adjusting for them.</p>",2021-10-26

Studying entorhinal grid cells as paradigmatic examples of modular architecture and function, we demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of a small number of discrete spatial and functional modules from an interplay between continuously varying lateral interactions generated by smooth cortical gradients. We derive a comprehensive analytic theory of modularization, revealing that the process is highly generic with its robustness deriving from topological origins. The theory generates universal predictions for the sequence of grid period ratios, furnishing the most accurate explanation of grid cell data to date.

To inform conservation efforts to model population viability for these threatened species, as well understand the mechanisms underpinning persistence of several potentially zoonotic pathogens hosted by these bats, we here define the seasonal limits of a staggered annual birth pulse across the three species. Our field studies in central-eastern Madagascar indicate that this annual birth pulse takes place in September/October for P. rufus, November for E. dupreanum, and December for R. madagascariensis. Juvenile development periods vary across the three Malagasy pteropodids, resulting in near-synchronous weaning of pups for all species in late January-February at the height of the fruiting season for Madagascar, a pattern characteristic of most mammalian frugivores on the island. We here document the size range in morphological traits for the three Malagasy fruit bat species; these traits span the range of those known for pteropodids more broadly, with P. rufus and E. dupreanum among the larger of recorded species and R. madagascariensis among the smaller. All three species demonstrate subtle sexual dimorphism in observed traits with larger-bodied males vs. females. We explore seasonal variation in adult body condition by comparing observed body mass with body mass predicted by forearm length, demonstrating that pregnant females add weight during staggered gestation periods and males lose weight during the nutritionally-deficit Malagasy winter. Finally, we quantify forearm, tibia, and ear length growth rates in juvenile bats, demonstrating both faster growth and more protracted development times for the largest P. rufus species. The longer development period for the already-threatened P. rufus further jeopardizes this species' conservation status as human hunting of bats for subsistence is particularly detrimental to population viability during reproductive periods. The more extreme seasonal variation in the mass to forearm relationship for P. rufus may also modulate immune function, an important consideration given these bats' roles as reservoir hosts for several high profile viral families known to cause severe disease in humans. Our work highlights the importance of longitudinal field studies in collecting critical data for mammalian conservation efforts and human public health alike.</p>",2021-10-29

Influenza is a rapidly mutating RNA virus responsible for annual epidemics causing substantial morbidity, mortality, and economic loss. Characterizing influenza virus mutational diversity and evolutionary processes within and between human hosts can provide tools to help track and understand transmission events. In this study we investigated possible differences between the intrahost genomic content of influenza virus in upper respiratory swabs and exhaled aerosols thought to be enriched for virus from the lower respiratory tract. 

Results. We examined the sequences of specimens collected from influenza A virus (IAV) infected college community members from December 2012 through May 2013. We analyzed four types of IAV samples μm aerosols (N=38), coarse &gt;5μm aerosols (N=27), nasopharyngeal (N=53), and oropharyngeal swabs (N=47)) collected from 42 study participants with 60 sampling instances. Eighteen (42.9%) participants had data from four sample types (nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, coarse aerosol, fine aerosol) included in the analysis, 10 (23.8%) had data from 3 sample types, 10 (23.8%) had data from 2 sample types, and 4 (9.5%) had data from one type of sample included in the analysis. We found that 481 (53.3%) consensus single nucleotide polymorphisms are shared by all sample types and 600 (66.5%) are shared by at least three different sample types. We observed that within a single patient consensus and non-consensus single nucleotide variants are shared across all sample types. Finally, we inferred a phylogenetic tree using consensus sequences and found that samples derived from a single patient are monophyletic. 
 
Conclusions. Single nucleotide polymorphisms did not differentiate between samples with varying origin along the respiratory tree. We found that signatures of variation in non-consensus intrahost single nucleotide variants are host and sample, but not site-specific. We conclude that the genomic information available does not allow us to discern a transmission route. Future investigation into whether any site-specific mutational signatures emerge over a longer period of infection, for example in immunocompromised hosts, can be interesting from the virus evolution perspective.</p>",2021-10-29

If these actions are guided by effector-independent mechanisms, similar kinematics should be observed when the action is performed by the hand or by a cortically remote and less experienced effector, such as the foot. We tested this hypothesis with two characteristic components of action: the initial ballistic stage of reaching, and the preshaping of the digits during grasping based on object size. We examined if these kinematic features reflect effector-independent mechanisms by asking participants to reach toward and to grasp objects of different widths with their hand and foot. First, during both reaching and grasping, the velocity profile up to peak velocity matched between the hand and the foot, indicating a shared ballistic acceleration phase. Secondly, maximum grip aperture and time of maximum grip aperture of grasping increased with object size for both effectors, indicating encoding of object size during transport. Differences between the hand and foot were found in the deceleration phase and time of maximum grip aperture, likely due to biomechanical differences and the participants’ inexperience with foot actions. These findings provide evidence for effector-independent visuomotor mechanisms of reaching and grasping that generalize across body parts.</p>",2021-10-28

Concomitant seasonal influenza vaccination with a COVID-19 vaccine booster could help to minimise potential disruption to the seasonal influenza vaccination campaign and maximise protection against both diseases among individuals at risk of severe disease and hospitalisation.

Unsolicited adverse events (AEs) occurring immediately, solicited local and systemic reactions up to day (D)8, and unsolicited AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), AEs of special interest (AESIs) and medically attended AEs (MAAEs) up to D22 were reported. Haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody responses to influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria strains and SARS CoV-2 binding antibody responses (SARS-CoV-2 Pre-Spike IgG ELISA) were assessed at D1 and D22.

<bold>Findings</bold>

Of 306 participants randomised, 296 were included for analysis (Coad, n=100; QIV-HD, n=92; mRNA-1273, n=104). Reactogenicity profiles were similar between the Coad and mRNA-1273 groups, with lower reactogenicity rates in the QIV-HD group (frequency [95% CIs] of solicited injection site reactions: 86·0% [77·6–92·1], 91·3% [84·2–96·0] and 61·8% [50·9–71·9] ; solicited systemic reactions: 80·0% [70·8–87·3], 83·7% [75·1–90·2] and 49·4% [38·7–60·2], respectively). Up to D22, unsolicited AEs were reported for 17·0% and 14·4% participants in the Coad and mRNA-1273 groups, respectively, with a lower rate (10·9%) in the QIV-HD group. Seven MAAEs were reported (Coad, n=3; QIV-HD, n=1; mRNA-1273, n=3). There were no SAEs, AESIs or deaths. HAI antibody geometric mean titres (GMTs) increased from D1 to D22 to similar levels for each influenza strain in the Coad and QIV-HD groups (GMTs [95% confidence interval], range across strains: Coad, 286 [233–352] to 429 [350–525] ; QIV-HD, 315 [257–386] to 471 [378–588]). SARS-CoV-2 binding antibody geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) also increased to similar levels in the Coad and mRNA-1273 groups (D22 GMCs [95% confidence interval]: 7634 [6445–9042] and 7904 [6883–9077], respectively).

However, previous work has focused either on the dynamics of neural activity during decision-making or on models of evidence accumulation governing behavior. We unify these two perspectives by introducing an evidence-accumulation framework that simultaneously describes multi-neuron population spiking activity and dynamic stimulus-driven behavior during sensory decision-making. We apply our method to behavioral choices and neural activity recorded from three brain regions - the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), the frontal orienting fields (FOF), and the anterior-dorsal striatum (ADS) - while rats performed a pulse-based accumulation task. The model accurately captures the relationship between stimuli and neural activity, the coordinated activity of neural populations, and the distribution of animal choices in response to the stimulus. Model fits show strikingly distinct accumulation models expressed within each brain region, and that all differ strongly from the accumulation strategy expressed at the level of choices. In particular, the FOF exhibited a suboptimal 'primacy' strategy, where early sensory evidence was favored. Including neural data in the model led to improved prediction of the moment-by-moment value of accumulated evidence and the intended-and ultimately made-choice of the animal.

Since the virus affects a variety of tissue types, there has been interest in understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection in early development and the placenta. The expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2, both genes  critical for viral entry, is present in placental-specific cell types such as extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) and, especially, syncytiotrophoblasts (STs). The potential of SARS-CoV-2 to infect these placental cells and its effect on placental development and function is still unclear. Furthermore, it is crucial to understand the possible mechanism of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the placenta. Here, we developed an in vitro model of SARS-CoV-2 infection of placental cell types using induced trophoblast stem cells (iTSCs). This model allowed us to show that STs but not EVTs are infected. Importantly, infected STs lack the expression of key differentiation genes, lack typically observed differentiated morphology and produce significantly lower human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) compared to non-infected controls. We also show that an anti-ACE2 antibody prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection and restores normal ST differentiation and function.

In an increasingly globalized world, no country can remain immune to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has exposed the need for effective public health surveillance in the interest of global health security. However, current indicators are limited in doing a comparative intercountry assessment and comparison because of variation in testing rates and reporting standards. Hence, this study attempts at addressing this gap.

Methods 
The study proposes incremental change in cases per testing rate (ICTR) as an indicator for doing cross country comparison of the pandemic progress. The equation for calculating this indicator is explained in this study. This is followed by measuring its strength of association and predictive power for determining change in SARS-CoV-2 cases in five countries (USA, UK, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh).

Results and discussion
ICTR was found to have a significantly higher strength of association and predictive power (than the existing indicator- test positivity rate) for determining change in cases over different time periods. Using ICTR, cross country comparison was done for the five countries for15 months to draw deeper insights into the progress of the pandemic. 

Conclusions
The study finds ICTR to be a suitable indicator for inter country comparison and intra country monitoring of the pandemic, which would be useful for global COVID-19 surveillance.

Env is conformationally flexible, but controls its transition from the unbound “closed” conformation (State 1) to downstream CD4-bound conformations (States 2/3), which are required for fusion. In particular, HIV-1 has evolved several mechanisms that reduce the premature “opening” of Env which exposes highly conserved epitopes recognized by non-neutralizing antibodies (nnAbs) capable of mediating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Env cleavage decreases its conformational transitions favoring the adoption of the “closed” conformation. Here we altered the gp160 furin cleavage site to impair Env cleavage and to examine its impact on ADCC responses mediated by plasma from HIV-1-infected individuals. We found that infected primary CD4+ T cells expressing uncleaved, but not wildtype, Env are efficiently recognized by nnAbs and become highly susceptible to ADCC responses mediated by plasma from HIV-1-infected individuals. Thus, HIV-1 limits the exposure of uncleaved Env at the surface of HIV-1-infected cells at least in part to escape ADCC responses.</p>",2021-10-26

Analysis of the copy number changes and loss of heterozygosity revealed that all sublines share a large deletion and loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 12, which harbors type I interferon and CDKN2 gene clusters. We identified a substantial number of genetic differences among the sublines including single nucleotide variants, indels, and copy number variations. The spectrum of single nucleotide variants indicated a close genetic relationship between Vero JCRB0111 and Vero CCL-81, and between Vero 76 and Vero E6, and a considerable genetic gap between the former two and the latter two lines. In contrast, we confirmed the pattern of genomic integration sites of simian endogenous retroviral sequences, which was consistent among the sublines. We identified subline-specific/enriched loss of function and missense variants, which potentially contribute to the differences in response to viral infection among the Vero sublines. In particular, we focused on Vero E6-specific/enriched variants and identified four genes (IL1RAP, TRIM25, RB1CC1, and ATG2A) that contained missense variants specific or enriched in Vero E6.

Therefore, binding to the enzyme may interfere the enzyme function. Before, we found that sulfated polysaccharide binding to 3CLpro might block the virus replication. Hence, we hypothesize that negative charged pectin glycan may also impede the virus replication. Here we show that 922 crude polysaccharide from Syzygium aromaticum may near completely block SARS-CoV-2 replication. The inhibition rate was 99.9% (EC50 : 0.90 muM). Interestingly, 922 can associates with 3CLpro, PLpro and RdRp. We further show that the homogeneous glycan 922211 from 922 may specifically attenuate 3CL protease activity. The IC50s of 922 and 922211 against 3CLpro are 4.73 plusmn 1.05 muM and 0.18 plusmn 0.01 muM, respectively. Monosaccharide composition analysis reveals that 922211 with molecular weight of 78.7 kDa is composed of rhamnose, galacturonic acid, galactose and arabinose in the molar ratio of 8.21 : 37.81 : 3.58 : 4.49. The structure characterization demonstrated that 922211 is a homogalacturonan linked to RG-I pectin polysaccharide. The linear homogalacturonan part in the backbone may be partly methyl esterified while RG-I type part bearing 1, 4-linked alpha-GalpA, 1, 4-linked alpha-GalpAOMe and 1, 2, 4-linked alpha-Rhap. There are four branches attached to C-1 or C4 position of Rhamnose glycosyl residues on the backbone.

Natural processes following partial restoration has lead to ecosystem recovery in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. However, understanding the efficacy of a “field of dreams” approach requires comparison of different approaches to partial restoration in terms of spatial, temporal, and ecological scale to what would happen with more comprehensive restoration efforts. We explore the relative effect of partial restoration and ongoing recovery on restoration efficacy with a dynamical model based on temperate rocky reefs in Northern California. We analyze our model for both the ability and rate of bull kelp forest recovery under different restoration strategies. We compare the efficacy of a partial restoration approach with a more comprehensive restoration effort by exploring how kelp recovery likelihood and rate change with varying intensities of urchin removal and kelp outplanting over different time periods and spatial scales. We find that, for the case of bull kelp forests, setting more favorable initial conditions for kelp recovery through implementing both urchin harvesting and kelp outplanting at the start of the restoration project has a bigger impact on the kelp recovery rate than applying restoration efforts through a longer period of time. Therefore partial restoration efforts, in terms of spatial and temporal scale, can be significantly more effective when applied across multiple ecological scales in terms of both the capacity and rate of achieving the target outcomes.</p><sec><title>Open Research Statement</title><p>The data used in this work is presented in McPherson et al.

Drosophila neuroblasts have been shown to be temporally patterned by sequentially expressed Temporal Transcription Factors (TTFs). These TTFs are proposed to form a transcriptional cascade based on mutant phenotypes, although direct transcriptional regulation between TTFs has not been verified in most cases.  Furthermore, it is not known how the temporal transitions are coupled with generation of the appropriate number of neurons at each stage. We use neuroblasts of the Drosophila optic lobe medulla to address these questions, and show that the expression of TTFs Sloppy-paired 1/ 2 (Slp1/2) is regulated at transcriptional level directly by two other TTFs and the cell-cycle dependent Notch signaling through two cis-regulatory elements.   We also show that supplying transcriptional active Notch can rescue the delayed transition into the Slp stage in cell cycle arrested neuroblasts. Our findings reveal how an interplay between temporal patterning, the neuroblast cell cycle and key signaling pathways such as Notch achieves precise regulation of patterning transcription factor gene expression that is characteristic of these programs.</p>",2021-10-29

The earliest stages of development are regulated by mRNAs deposited into the egg by the mother, until the zygote can become competent to transcribe its own genome. Previously, we showed that the set of maternally deposited and early transcribed zygotic mRNAs in Drosophila are generally conserved across species, but with some notable variation. We also showed that a majority of regulators of these two types of transcripts are shared. In this study, we examine the differences in regulatory motifs associated with maternal deposition and early zygotic transcription across species of Drosophila. For maternal transcripts, while the regulators are mostly conserved, we find the Drosophila pseudoobscura species subgroup appears to contain numerous novel regulatory motifs unique to these species. These novel motifs are enriched in transposable elements exclusive to this group. As this species group had been previously identified as having the largest divergence in early embryonic transcripts given their divergence time, this change in regulation may be responsible. However, transcripts that are present at the maternal stage only in these species are equally enriched in novel (group-specific) and conserved binding sites, so the novel regulation is not the sole cause of regulatory divergence in these species. At the zygotic stage, we observe a wide variety of species-specific motifs. Additionally, at both stages we observe motifs conserved across species having different effects on gene expression in different species, and regulating different sets of genes in different species. By examining changes in motif content across species, we find that changes in motif content alone is generally insufficient to drive gene expression changes across species.</p>",2021-10-29

To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, here we have specifically focused on the transdifferentiation from B cells to macrophages. The process is triggered by exactly the same molecular mechanism -- the induction by the transcription factor (TF) CEBPA -- but takes three days in mouse and seven in human. In mouse, the speed of this process is known to be associated with Myc expression. We found that in this species, CEBPA binds strongly to the Myc promoter, efficiently down-regulating Myc. In human, in contrast, CEBPA does not bind this promoter, and MYC is indirectly and more slowly down-regulated. Attenuation of CEBPA binding is not specific to the MYC promoter, but a general trait of the human genome across multiple biological conditions. We traced back weak CEBPA binding to the primate-specific Alu repeat expansion. Many Alu repeats carry strong CEBPA binding motifs, which sequester CEBPA, and attenuate CEBPA binding genome-wide. We observed similar CEBPA and MYC dynamics in natural processes regulated by CEBPA, suggesting that CEBPA attenuation could underlie the longer duration in human processes controlled by this factor.

Greater appraisal discrepancy, indicating overestimation, was related to thinning of inferior-lateral temporal, fusiform, and rostral anterior cingulate cortices. Lower self-appraisal was associated with higher entorhinal and inferior temporal tau.

Background:
The world is currently unprepared to deal with a the drastic increase in global migration. There is an urgent need to develop programs to protect the well being and health of migrant peoples. Increased population movement is already evident throughout the Americas as exemplified by the rising number of migrant peoples that pass through the Darien neotropical moist broadleaf forest along the border region between Panama and Colombia. The transit of migrant peoples through this area has an increase in the last years. In 2021 an average of 9,400 people entered the region per month compared to 2,000-3,500 people monthly in 2019. Along this trail, there is no access to healthcare, food provision, potable water, or housing. To date, much of what is known about health needs and barriers to healthcare within this population is based on journalistic reports and anecdotes. There is a need for a comprehensive approach to assess the healthcare needs migrant peoples in transit.  This study aims to describe demographic characteristics, mental and physical health status and needs, and experiences of host communities, and to identify opportunities to improve healthcare provision to migrant peoples in transit in Panama. 

Study design and methods: 
This multi-method study will include qualitative (n=70) and quantitative (n=520) components.  The qualitative component includes interviews with migrant peoples in transit, national and international non-governmental organizations and agencies based in Panama. The quantitative component is a rapid epidemiological study which includes a questionnaire and four clinical screenings: mental health, sexual and reproductive health, general and tropical medicine, and nutrition. 

Conclusion:
This study will contribute to a better understanding of the health status and needs of migrant peoples in transit through Darien, Panama. Findings will be used to allocate resources and provide  targeted healthcare interventions for migrant peoples in transit through Darien, Panama.</p>",2021-10-29

The dimensionality of that divergence, however, remains contentious. At the extremes, some contend that populations diverge along a single axis of trait covariance with greatest availability of heritable variation, even if this does not lead a population directly to its fitness optimum. Those at the other extreme argue that selection can push populations towards their fitness optima along multiple phenotype axes simultaneously, resulting in divergence in numerous dimensions. Here, we address this debate using populations of threespine stickleback (<italic>Gasterosteus aculeatus</italic>) in the Cook Inlet region of southern Alaska from lakes with contrasting ecological conditions. We calculated effective dimensionality of divergence in several trait suites (defensive, swimming, and trophic) thought to be under correlated selection pressures, as well as across all traits. We also tested for integration among the trait suites and between each trait suite and the environment. We found that populations in the Cook Inlet radiation exhibit dimensionality of phenotype high enough to preclude a single axis of divergence.</p>",2021-10-31

Mercedes Lucas'}, {'name': 'Jose Pueyo'}]","<p>Heavy metals are an increasing problem due to contamination from human sources that and can enter the food chain by being taken up by plants. Understanding the genetic basis of accumulation and tolerance in plants is important for reducing the uptake of toxic metals in crops and crop relatives, as well as for removing heavy metals from soils by means of phytoremediation. Following exposure of Medicago truncatula seedlings to cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg), we conducted a genome-wide association study using relative root growth (RRG) and leaf accumulation measurements. Cd and Hg accumulation and RRG had heritability ranging 0.44 - 0.72 indicating high genetic diversity for these traits. The Cd and Hg trait associations were broadly distributed throughout the genome, indicated the traits are polygenic and involve several quantitative loci. For all traits, candidate genes included several membrane associated ATP-binding cassette transporters, P-type ATPase transporters, several oxidative stress response genes and stress related UDP-glycosyltransferases. The P-type ATPase transporters and ATP-binding cassette protein-families have roles in vacuole transport of heavy metals, and our findings support their wide use in physiological plant responses to heavy metals and abiotic stresses.  We also found associations between Cd RRG with the genes CAX3 and PDR3, two linked adjacent genes, and leaf accumulation of Hg associated with the genes NRAMP6 and CAX9. When plant genotypes with the most extreme phenotypes were compared, we found significant divergence in genomic regions using population genomics methods that contained metal transport and stress response gene ontologies. Several of these genomic regions show high linkage disequilibrium (LD) among candidate genes suggesting they have evolved together. Minor allele frequency (MAF) and effect size of the most significant SNPs was negatively correlated with large effect alleles being most rare. This is consistent with purifying selection against alleles that increase toxicity and abiotic stress.  Conversely, the alleles with large affect that had higher frequencies that were associated with the exclusion of Cd and Hg. Overall, macroevolutionary conservation of heavy metal and stress response genes is important for improvement of forage crops by harnessing wild genetic variants in gene banks such as the Medicago HapMap collection.</p>",2021-10-31

While much effort has been spent developing gene drives in mosquitoes, gene drive technology in molluscs has received little attention despite the role of freshwater snails as obligate, intermediate hosts of parasitic flukes causing schistosomiasis -- a disease of poverty affecting more than 200 million people worldwide.  A successful drive in snails must overcome self-fertilization, which prevents a drive's spread. Simultaneous hermaphroditism is a feature of snails -- distinct from gene drive model organisms -- and is not yet incorporated in gene drive models of disease control.  Here we developed a novel population genetic model accounting for snails' sexual and asexual reproduction, susceptibility to parasite infection regulated by multiple alleles, fitness differences between genotypes, and a range of drive characteristics.  We then integrated this model with an epidemiological model of schistosomiasis transmission and snail population dynamics.  Simulations showed that gene drive establishment can be hindered by a variety of biological and ecological factors, including selfing.  However, our model suggests that, under a range of conditions, gene drive mediated immunity in snails could maintain rapid disease reduction achieved by annual chemotherapy treatment of the human population, leading to long-term elimination.  These results indicate that gene drives, in coordination with existing public health measures, may become a useful tool to reduce schistosomiasis burden in selected transmission settings with effective CRISPR construct design and close evaluation of the genetic and ecological landscape.</p>",2021-10-29

Methods: CXR images from participants in the 2016 Kenya National TB Prevalence Survey were evaluated using CAD4TBv6 (Delft Imaging), giving a probabilistic score for pulmonary TB ranging from 0 (low probability) to 99 (high probability). We constructed a Bayesian latent class model to estimate the accuracy of CAD4TBv6 screening compared to bacteriologically–confirmed TB across CAD4TBv6 threshold cut–offs, incorporating data on Clinical Officer CXR interpretation, participant demographics (age, sex, TB symptoms, previous TB history), and sputum results. We compared model–estimated sensitivity and specificity of CAD4TBv6 to optimum and minimum TPPs.

Results: Of 63,050 prevalence survey participants, 61,848 (98%) had analysable CXR images, and 8,966 (14.5%) underwent sputum bacteriological testing; 298 had bacteriologically–confirmed pulmonary TB. Median CAD4TBv6 scores for participants with bacteriologically–confirmed TB were significantly higher (72, IQR: 58–82.75) compared to participants with bacteriologically–negative sputum results (49, IQR: 44–57, p&lt;0.0001). CAD4TBv6 met the optimum TPP; with the threshold set to achieve a mean sensitivity of 95% (optimum TPP), specificity was 83.3%, (95% credible interval [CrI]: 83.0%–83.7%, CAD4TBv6 threshold: 55). There was considerable variation in accuracy by participant characteristics, with older individuals and those with previous TB having lowest specificity. 

Conclusions: CAD4TBv6 met the optimal TPP for TB community screening. To optimise screening accuracy and efficiency of confirmatory sputum testing, we recommend that an adaptive approach to threshold setting is adopted based on participant characteristics.

Here, we used ultra-high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the involvement of the BF and MD across states of task-induced DMN activity modulation. Specifically, we mapped DMN activity suppression ('deactivation') when participants transitioned between rest and externally focused task performance, as well as DMN activity engagement ('activation') when task performance was internally (i.e., self) focused. Consistent with recent rodent studies, the BF showed overall activity suppression with DMN cortical regions when comparing the rest to external task conditions. Further analyses, including dynamic causal modelling, confirmed that the BF drove changes in DMN cortical activity during these rest-to-task transitions. The MD, by comparison, was specifically engaged during internally focused cognition and demonstrated a broad excitatory influence on DMN cortical activation.

Results: 12,313 children were included. Overall UTD coverage for all children was 71.0% in T1, dropped by 5.7% (95% CI: -6.2, -5.1) in T2, slightly increased in T3 but remained lower than in T1. MMR vaccine UTD coverage slightly decreased in T2 and T3 by approximately 2%. The largest decreases were seen at ages 15-month and 18-month old, with drops in on-time coverage of 14.7% (95% CI: -18.7, -10.6) and 16.4% (95% CI: -20.0, -12.8) respectively during T2. When stratified by sociodemographic characteristics, no specific subgroup of children was found to have been differentially impacted by the pandemic.
Conclusion: Childhood immunization coverage rates for children under 2 years in Ontario decreased significantly during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic and only partially recovered during the rest of 2020. Public health and educational interventions for providers and parents are needed to ensure adequate catch-up of delayed/missed immunizations to prevent potential outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>",2021-10-29

Evidence-based interventions that could be used to mitigate this impact are lacking in the literature. This review aims to evaluate psychological interventions used for employees following previous disasters and assess the transferability of these interventions to a healthcare setting during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Methods: Intervention information from a previously published systematic review of the literature published up to 2015 was extracted, and an additional search of studies published from 2015-2020 was conducted.  Studies were assessed for transferability using a checklist derived from the PIET-T process model. 
Results: Interventions from eighteen studies were assessed for transferability (including three studies identified in an updated literature search). Interventions established as most transferable included resilience training, meditation/mindfulness interventions, and cognitive behavioural therapy. Psychological debriefing was transferable but as it is contrary to current recommendations is not deemed appropriate for adoption. 
Implications: Several existing interventions have the potential to be utilised within the COVID-19 context/pandemic. More research needs to be undertaken in this area to assess these interventions upon transfer.</p>",2021-10-29

The aim of this study was to record the experiences of health professionals working in the first line of treatment of the pandemic, to analyse the effects of the pandemic on the interpersonal relationships of health professionals, and to ask about the stigma they faced during their work with people with covid-19.
This is a qualitative study with an ethnographic approach based on 160 semi-structured interviews with health professionals living and working in the Epirus Region, Greece. For the data collection we used semi-structured interviews, discussions and participatory observation.  Specifically, the interviews were conducted on health professionals and more specifically doctors, nurses, rescuers, physiotherapists and administrative staff, working in covid-19 units at the University General Hospital of Ioannina (Reference hospital for Ioannina, in Epirus), which assists in the treatment of patients with covid-19, and in the branch of the rescue department of Ioannina. 
The data were analysed in four thematic units based on their common characteristics: a) emotions and experiences of health professionals, b) interpersonal relations of health professionals, c) social exclusion and discrimination, and d) health professionals as patients. The results showed that the main emotions that health professionals experienced when they were moved to covid-19 clinics were fear, anxiety, distress, anger and insecurity. These feelings worsened when their family environment treated them with fear and hesitancy. Their social environment tended to avoid them, leading to a state of self-isolation. To conclude, health professionals faced discriminating behaviors and stigma both from their families and social environment, and from other health professionals. The government struggled to handle the situation in keeping a balance between both the security and well-being of health professionals as it was not prepared for a pandemic like this.</p>",2021-10-29

Independent biological duplicate samples of floral buds and open-flowers were collected from ‘Somei-Yoshino’ trees grown at three different locations in Japan. RNA-seq reads obtained from floral bud and open-flower samples collected in the current study (in 2019) and in a previous study (in 2017) were aligned against the genome sequence of ‘Somei-Yoshino’ to quantify gene transcript levels.

Based on the identified gene modules and Gene Ontology (GO) terms enriched at different floral stages, we speculate that the genetic mechanisms underlying petal movement and flower opening in cherry involve the processes of development, cell wall organization, reproduction, and metabolism, which are executed by genes encoding transcription factors, phytohormones, transporters, and polysaccharide metabolic enzymes.

In a mouse model of Group A <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (GAS)-induced sepsis, severe immunological stress was associated with significant depletion of bone marrow HSPCs and mortality within approximately 5-7 days. We hypothesized that the inflammatory environment of GAS infection drives rapid HSPC differentiation and depletion that can be rescued by infusion of donor HSPCs. Indeed, infusion of 10,000 naïve HSPCs into GAS-infected mice resulted in rapid myelopoiesis and a 50-60% increase in overall survival. Surprisingly, mice receiving donor HSPCs displayed a similar pathogen load compared to untreated mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a significantly increased number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in HSPC-infused mice, which correlated with reduced inflammatory cytokine levels and restored HSPC levels.

While public health interventions and provincially regulated health insurance coverage have been credited with minimizing transmission rates in Canada relative to neighboring countries, disease presentation has been presumed to be the same. 
Aim: We sought to determine factors associated with differences in gastrointestinal outcomes in COVID-19 patients at a Canadian hospital.
Methods: We collected data from 192 hospital records of COVID-19 patients across seven Hamilton Health Sciences hospitals, a network of academic health centers located in Hamilton, Ontario serving one of the largest metropolitan areas in Canada. Statistical and correlative analysis of symptoms, comorbidities, and mortality were performed.
Results: There were 192 patients. The mean age was 57.6 years (SD=21.0). For patients who died (n=27, 14%), mean age was 79.2 years old (SD=10.6) versus 54 years for survivors (SD=20.1). There was a higher mortality among patients with older age (p=0.000), long hospital stay (p=0.004), male patients (p=0.032), and patients in nursing homes (p=0.000). Patients with dyspnea (p=0.028) and hypertension (p=0.004) were more likely to have a poor outcome.  Laboratory test values that were significant in determining outcomes were an elevated INR (p=0.007) and elevated creatinine (p=0.000).

Sequencing of viral-like-particles (VLPs) demonstrated both a high diversity and high inter-individual variation of the murine gut virome composed of eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophages. Antibiotics also had a significant impact on the gut murine virome causing a delayed resilience independent of genotype. However, compositional shifts in the virome and bacteriome were highly correlated, indicating a possible role of the virome in inflammatory bowel disease.

We introduce here a strategy that uses bacterial insertion sequences, the simplest autonomous transposable elements to insert and amplify genetic cargo into a bacterial chromosome.

Many cell types, including cancer cells, can assemble a cortical flow engine to migrate under confinement and low adhesion in vitro, but it remains unclear whether this engine is endogenously utilized in vivo. Moreover, in the context of a changing environment, it is not known how upstream regulation can set in motion and sustain a mutual feedback between flow and polarity. Here, we establish that Drosophila primordial germ cells (PGCs) utilize cortical flow driven amoeboid migration and that flows are oriented by external cues during developmental homing in vivo. The molecular basis of flow modulation is a phosphoregulated feedback loop involving RhoGEF2, a microtubule plus-end tracking RhoA specific RhoGEF, enriched at the rear of PGCs. RhoGEF2 depletion slows and disorganizes cortical flow, reducing migration speed, while RhoGEF2 activation accelerates cortical flow, thereby augmenting myosin II polarity and migration speed. Both perturbations impair PGC pathfinding, suggesting cortical flows must be tuned for accurate guidance. We surprisingly find that RhoGEF2 polarity and activation are independent of upstream canonical Gα12/13 signaling. Instead, its PDZ domain and conserved RhoA binding residues in its PH domain are required to establish a positive feedback loop that augments its basal activity. Upstream regulation of this feedback loop occurs via AMPK dependent multisite phosphorylation near a conserved EB1 binding SxIP motif, which releases RhoGEF2 from EB1 dependent inhibition. Thus, we reveal cortical flows as versatile, tunable engines for directed amoeboid migration in vivo.</p>",2021-10-29

In particular, the notion that antihypertensives are more effective if taken at bedtime draws disproportionately from one source in the field, which consistently detects larger effects than the community average.

Although being a powerful tool, off-target effects of these inhibitors are easily overlooked in a complex biological setting. Here we illustrate the implications of such secondary effects by focusing on piperonylic acid (PA), an inhibitor of CINNAMATE-4-HYDROXYLASE (C4H) that is often used to investigate the involvement of lignin during plant growth and development. When supplied to plants, we found that PA is recognized as a substrate by GRETCHEN HAGEN 3.6 (GH3.6), an amido synthetase involved in the formation of the auxin catabolite indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-Asp. By competing for the same enzyme, PA interferes with auxin conjugation, resulting in an increase in cellular auxin concentrations. These increased auxin levels likely further contribute to an increase in adventitious rooting previously observed upon PA-treatment. Despite the focus on GH3.6 in this report, PA is conjugated by an array of enzymes and their subsequent reduced activity on native substrates could potentially affect a whole set of physiological processes in the plant. We conclude that surrogate occupation of the endogenous conjugation machinery in the plant by exogenous compounds is likely a more general phenomenon that is rarely considered in pharmacological studies.

This allows us to explore the quantitative relationship between precaution and uncertainty. Working from estimates of the state wolf population in April 2021 and an estimate of reproduction to November, we constructed a simple linear model with uninformative priors for the period April 2021-April 2022 including an uncertain wolf-hunt in November 2021.

In support of this, here we report hypoexcitability of juvenile layer-V pyramidal neurons in the AI, concomitant with reduced glutamatergic synaptic input to these cells. Chemogenetic activation of the AI attenuated the compulsive trait suggesting that delayed maturation of the AI results in suboptimal integration of sensory and cognitive information in adolescents and this contributes to inflexible behaviors in specific conditions of reward availability.</p>",2021-10-29

This work describes a light-driven xanthophyll cycle operating in the chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and involving the xanthophylls Lutein (L) and Loroxanthin (Lo). Pigments were quantified during a switch from high to low light and at different time points from cells grown in Day/night cycle. Trimeric LHCII was purified from cells acclimated to high or low light and their pigment content and spectroscopic properties were characterized. The Lo/(L+Lo) ratio in the cells varies by a factor of 10 between cells grown in low or high light leading to a change in the Lo/(L+Lo) ratio in trimeric LHCII from 0.5 in low light to 0.07 in high light. Trimeric LhcbMs binding Loroxanthin have 5+/-1% higher excitation energy transfer from carotenoid to Chlorophyll as well as higher thermo- and photostability than trimeric LhcbMs that only bind Lutein. The Loroxanthin cycle operates on long time scales (hours to days) and likely evolved as a shade adaptation. It has many similarities with the Lutein-epoxide - Lutein cycle of plants.</p>,2021-10-29

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are used to explore different surgical options. The objective of this study is to perform a systematic in vitro validation for investigating the accuracy and efficiency of CFD simulation to predict Fontan hemodynamics. Methods: CFD simulations were performed to measure indexed power loss (iPL) and hepatic flow distribution (HFD) in 10 patient-specific Fontan models, with varying mesh and numerical solvers. The results were compared with a novel in vitro flow loop setup with 3D printed Fontan models. A high-resolution differential pressure sensor was used to measure the pressure drop for validating iPL predictions. Microparticles with particle filtering system were used to measure HFD. The computational time was measured for a representative Fontan model with different mesh sizes and numerical solvers. Results: When compared to in vitro setup, variations in CFD mesh sizes had significant effect on HFD (p = 0.0002) but no significant impact on iPL (p = 0.069). Numerical solvers had no significant impact in both iPL (p = 0.50) and HFD (P = 0.55). A transient solver with 0.5 mm mesh size requires computational time 100 times more than a steady solver with 2.5 mm mesh size to generate similar results. Conclusions: The predictive value of CFD for Fontan planning can be validated against an in vitro flow loop. The prediction accuracy can be affected by the mesh size, model shape complexity and flow competition.</p>",2021-10-29

Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is one of the most widely used pesticides worldwide. Multiple laboratory studies have reported on either the long-term behavioral effect of a single, high-dose CPF or studied sub-chronic behavioral effects particularly the motor and cognitive effects of repeated low-dose CPF exposure. However, studies on chronic mood and depression-related morbidities following repeated sub-threshold CPF doses that would mimic occupationally-relevant OP exposures are lacking. Here, adult male rats were injected with CPF (1, 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg/d, s.c.) for 21-days. Dependent on the CPF dose, ChE activity was inhibited approximately 60-80% in the blood and about 20-50% in the hippocampus at 2-days after the end of CPF exposures. Following an 11-week washout period, CPF-treated rats exhibited a dose-dependent increase in signs of anhedonia (sucrose preference test), anxiety (open-field and elevated plus-maze), and despair (forced swim test) despite a complete recovery of ChE activity at this stage. We speculate that both cholinergic and non-cholinergic mechanisms could play a role in the development of chronic OP-related depressive outcomes. The proposed CPF exposure paradigm could provide an ideal model to further study molecular mechanisms underlying cause and effect relationships between environmental OP exposures and the development of chronic behavioral deficits.</p>",2021-10-29

In plants, the relatively small population size in GWAS and the high genetic diversity found many plant species can impede mapping efforts on complex traits. Here we present a novel haplotype-based trait fine-mapping framework, HapFM, to supplement current GWAS methods. HapFM uses genotype data to partition the genome into haplotype blocks, identifies haplotype clusters within each block, and then performs genome-wide haplotype fine-mapping to infer the causal haplotype blocks of trait. We benchmarked HapFM, GEMMA, BSLMM, and GMMAT in both simulation and real plant GWAS datasets. HapFM consistently resulted in higher mapping power than the other GWAS methods in simulations with high polygenicity. Moreover, it resulted in higher mapping resolution, especially in regions of high LD, by identifying small causal blocks in the larger haplotype block. In the Arabidopsis flowering time (FT10) datasets, HapFM identified four novel loci compared to GEMMA results, and its average mapping interval of HapFM was 9.6 times smaller than that of GEMMA. In conclusion, HapFM is tailored for plant GWAS to result in high mapping power on complex traits and improved mapping resolution to facilitate crop improvement.</p>",2021-10-29

Objectives
The purpose of this study was to assess the energy availability status of professional female football players with an online Female Football Energy Availability Questionnaire (FFEAQ), combined with the clinical tool to model menstrual cycle hormones using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. 
Methods
The Female Football Energy Availability (FFEAQ) was developed based on published questionnaires, with a weighted scoring system to assess risk of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S). For menstrual cycle hormones AI techniques modelled hormone variation over a cycle, using the results from capillary blood samples taken at two time points.
Results
21 female footballers of professional club level participated in this study, with mean age 22 years [range 16 to 30]. 20 athletes recorded positive scores on the FFEAQ, suggesting a low risk of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S). No players had experienced primary amenorrhoea. 5 athletes reported previous history of secondary amenorrhoea. Amongst the 15 players not taking hormonal contraception, 2 reported current oligomenorrhoea. 
The application of AI techniques to model menstrual cycle hormones found that in 1 of the 3 players, subclinical hormone disruption was occurring with this player reporting variable flow of menstruation. Although the other 2 players showed expected menstrual hormone variation, 1 player reported variable flow according to training load, suggestive of subclinical anovulation. At the time of testing training load was low due to pandemic lock down. 
Conclusions
The professional female football athletes in this study were found to be at low risk of RED-S from the FFEAQ. Modelling menstrual cycle hormones using AI techniques indicated that this has the potential to be an effective clinical tool in identifying subtle hormone dysfunction such as subclinical anovulatory cycles in female athletes.</p>",2021-10-30

To what extent R-loop abundance and genome-wide localization is actively regulated during metazoan embryogenesis is unknown. The developmental program of Drosophila embryogenesis provides a powerful system to study address these questions due to its well-characterized developmental program, the sudden onset of zygotic transcription and available genome-wide ChIP and transcription data sets. Here, we measure the overall abundance and genome localization of R-loops in early and late-stage embryos relative to Drosophila cultured cells. We demonstrate that proper absolute R-loop levels change during embryogenesis and that resolution of R-loops is critical for embryonic development. R-loop mapping by strand-specific DRIP-seq revealed that R-loop localization is plastic across development, both in the genes which form R-loops and where they localize relative to gene bodies. Importantly, these changes are not driven by changes in the transcriptional program. Rather, negative GC skew and absolute changes in AT skew are associated with R-loop formation in Drosophila. Furthermore, we demonstrate that while some chromatin binding proteins and histone modification such as H3K27me3 are associated with R-loops throughout development, other chromatin factors associated with R-loops in a developmental specific manner. Our findings highlight the importance and developmental plasticity of R-loops during Drosophila development.</p>",2021-10-29
