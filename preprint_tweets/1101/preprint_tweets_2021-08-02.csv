However, a question remains whether vaccine breakthrough cases can still lead to Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), also known as Long Covid. To address this question, the Survivor Corps group, a grassroots COVID-19 organization focused on patient support and research, posted a poll to its 169,900 members that asked about breakthrough cases, Long Covid, and hospitalizations. 1,949 people who self-report being fully vaccinated have responded to date. While robust data are needed in a larger, unbiased sample to extrapolate rates to the population, we analyzed the results of this public poll to determine what people were reporting regarding Long Covid after breakthrough infection and to prompt discussion of how breakthrough cases are measured. The poll was posted in the Survivor Corps Facebook group (∼169,900 members). Of the 1,949 participants who responded to the poll, 44 reported a symptomatic breakthrough case and 24 of those reported that the case led to symptoms of Long Covid. 1 of these 24 cases was reported to have led to hospitalization in addition to Long Covid.</p>",2021-07-26

Cardiac damage is attributed mostly to a bystander effect: the aberrant host response to acute respiratory infection. However, direct infection of cardiac tissue by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also occurs. We examined here the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) that beat spontaneously. These cardiomyocytes express the angiotensin I converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and a subset of the proteases that mediate spike protein cleavage in the lungs, but not transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection was productive: viral transcripts accounted for about 88% of total mRNA. In the cytoplasm of infected hiPSC-CM, smooth walled exocytic vesicles contained numerous 65-90 nm particles with typical ribonucleocapsid structures, and virus-like particles with knob-like spikes covered the cell surface. To better understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 spread in hiPSC-CM we engineered an expression vector coding for the spike protein with a monomeric emerald-green fluorescent protein fused to its cytoplasmic tail (S-mEm). Proteolytic processing of S-mEm and the parental spike were equivalent. Live cell imaging tracked spread of S-mEm signal from cell to cell and documented formation of syncytia. A cell-permeable, peptide-based molecule that blocks the catalytic site of furin abolished cell fusion. A spike mutant with the single amino acid change R682S that inactivates the furin cleavage site was fusion inactive. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in hiPSC-CM and furin activation of its spike protein is required for fusion-based cytopathology. This hiPSC-CM platform provides an opportunity for target-based drug discovery in cardiac COVID-19.</p>",2021-07-30

There is a plethora of different computational tools that process the raw MS data and derive peptide and protein identification and quantification. During the last decade, there has been dramatic progress in computer science and software engineering, including collaboration tools that have transformed research and industry. To leverage these advances, we developed AlphaPept, a Python-based open-source framework for efficient processing of large high-resolution MS data sets. Using Numba for just-in-time machine code compilation on CPU and GPU, we achieve hundred-fold speed improvements while maintaining clear syntax and rapid development speed. AlphaPept uses the Python scientific stack of highly optimized packages, reducing the code base to domain-specific tasks while providing access to the latest advances in machine learning. We provide an easy on-ramp for community validation and contributions through the concept of literate programming, implemented in Jupyter Notebooks of the different modules. A framework for continuous integration, testing, and benchmarking enforces solid software engineering principles. Large datasets can rapidly be processed as shown by the analysis of hundreds of cellular proteomes in minutes per file, many-fold faster than the data acquisiton. The AlphaPept framework can be used to build automated processing pipelines using efficient HDF5 based file formats, web-serving functionality and compatibility with downstream analysis tools. Easy access for end-users is provided by one-click installation of the graphical user interface, for advanced users via a modular Python library, and for developers via a fully open GitHub repository.</p>",2021-07-26

Especially in schools, the duration of stay is long and the number of people in the rooms is large, increasing the risk of infection. This problem particularly affects schools without pre-installed ventilation systems that are equipped with filters and/or operate with fresh air. Here, the aerosol concentration is reduced by natural ventilation. In this context, we are investigating the effect of large mobile air purifiers (AP) with HEPA filters on particle concentration and their suitability for classroom use in a primary school in Germany. The three tested APs differ significantly in their air outlet characteristics. Measurements of the number of particles, the particle size distribution, and the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration were carried out in the classroom with students (April/May 2021) and with an aerosol generator without students. In this regard, the use of APs leads to a substantial reduction in aerosol particles. At the same time, the three APs are found to have differences in their particle decay rate, noise level, and flow velocity. In addition to the measurements, the effect of various influencing parameters on the potential inhaled particle dose was investigated using a calculation model. The parameters considered include the duration of stay, particle concentration in exhaled air, respiratory flow rate, virus lifetime, ventilation interval, ventilation efficiency, AP volumetric flow, as well as room size. Based on the resulting effect diagrams, significant recommendations can be derived for reducing the risk of infection from virus-laden aerosols. Finally, the measurements were compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, as such tools can aid the optimal placement and configuration of APs and can be used to study the effect of the spread of aerosols from a source in the classroom.</p>",2021-07-26

DynA does not prevent phage infection and replication in individual cells, but significantly delays host cell lysis, thereby slowing down the release of phage progeny from the host cells. During the process, DynA forms large, almost immobile clusters on the cell membrane that seem to support membrane integrity. Single molecule tracking revealed a shift of freely diffusive molecules within the cytosol towards extended, confined motion at the cell membrane following phage induction. Thus, the bacterial dynamins are the first anti-phage system reported to delay host cell lysis and the last line of defense of a multilayered antiviral defense.

We show that in zebrafish the AVC forms within a zone of tissue convergence between the atrium and the ventricle which is associated with increased activation of the actomyosin meshwork and endocardial cell orientation changes. We demonstrate that tissue convergence occurs with a major reduction of endocardial cell volume triggered by mechanical forces and the mechanosensitive channels TRPP2/TRPV4.

Previous work has shown that the activity of SMG1 is impaired by small molecule inhibitors, is reduced by the SMG1 interactors SMG8 and SMG9, and is downregulated by the so-called SMG1 insertion domain. However, the molecular basis for this complex regulatory network has remained elusive. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions of human SMG1-9 and SMG1-8-9 complexes bound to either a SMG1 inhibitor or a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue at overall resolutions ranging from 2.8 to 3.6 Å. These structures reveal the basis with which a small molecule inhibitor preferentially targets SMG1 over other PIKKs. By comparison with our previously reported substrate-bound structure (Langer et al. 2020), we show that the SMG1 insertion domain can exert an autoinhibitory function by directly blocking the substrate binding path as well as overall access to the SMG1 kinase active site. Together with biochemical analysis, our data indicate that SMG1 autoinhibition is stabilized by the presence of SMG8.

Despite its critical role in cancer development, the mechanisms that lay at the basis of oncogene-induced replication stress remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the mechanism of c-Myc-induced replication stress. Our data shows that c-Myc induces replication stress by increasing the amount of cohesins bound to chromatin in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This is independent of previously suggested mechanisms involving deregulation of replication initiation and transcriptional interference. Restoring the amount of chromatin-bound cohesins to control levels, or preventing the accumulation of cohesins at CTCF sites, in cells experiencing oncogenic c-Myc activity prevents replication stress. Increased cohesins chromatin occupancy correlates with a c-Myc-dependent increase in the levels of the cohesion loader Mau2. Preventing c-Myc-induced increase in Mau2 reduces oncogene-induced replication stress. Together our data support a novel mechanism for oncogene-induced replication stress. Since c-Myc activation is a crucial event in many human cancers (2), identifying the mechanisms through which this oncogene promotes replication stress provides critical insights into cancer biology.</p>",2021-07-26

First, we varied the explicit reward associated with the goal target and found an overall increase in movement vigor for higher reward targets, highlighted by larger velocities, feedback responses to external loads, and background muscle activity. Then, assuming that larger feedback gains were used to reject perturbations, we sought to investigate whether this effect hindered online decisions to switch to a new target in the presence of multiple successful goals. We indeed observed idiosyncratic switching strategies dependent on both target rewards and movement vigor, such that the more vigorous movements were less likely to switch to a new goal following perturbations. To gain further insight into a causal influence of movement vigor on rapid motor decisions, we demonstrated that biasing the baseline activity and reflex gains by means of a background load evoked a larger proportion of target switches in the direction opposite to the background load associated with lower muscle activity.

In this study, we demonstrate that during their initial riverine transitional phase, smolts were particularly vulnerable to predators. Specifically, avian predation appeared to be the main cause of mortality (42%), although piscine predation events were not trivial (14%). Our results suggested some direct and indirect tagging-induced mortality (e.g., through increased predation vulnerability), which highlights the importance of determining tagging mortality in a telemetry study to ensure adequate interpretation of migration success. There is evidence that predation induced selection on smolt morphology. Unsuccessful river salmon migrants with a phenotype comprising a shorter head and jaw and smaller eye had a higher probability of mortality in the later parts of riverine migration where avian and aquatic predation mortality dominated. In contrast, mortality earlier in river migration was independent of phenotype, most likely a result of tagging effects. Successfully river migrants were found to be interacting with each other, often in a pair or as a trio, indicating that a few individuals of Atlantic salmon and sea trout formed notable intra- and interspecific social associations. However, the heterogeneity of the social associations of successful migrants did not support the assumption that social network features attributed any clear specific benefits of reduced predation risk. Overall, by estimating migration loss and its variability, our study framework should help to guide management actions to mitigate the widespread population declines these species are currently facing.</p>",2021-07-26

Increased discounting has been linked to various psychiatric conditions, including substance-use-disorders, behavioral addictions and obesity. Despite its high intra-individual stability, temporal discounting is partly under contextual control. One prominent manipulation that has been linked to increases in discounting is the exposure to highly arousing appetitive cues. However, results from trial-wise cue exposure studies appear highly mixed, and changes in physiological arousal were not adequately controlled. Here we tested the effects of appetitive (erotic), aversive and neutral visual cues on temporal discounting in thirty-five healthy male participants.

Physiological arousal was elevated following aversive and in particular erotic cues.

We introduce a general Bayesian framework to relax the assumption of independent divergences during phylogenetic inference, and test for patterns predicted by processes of diversification that affect multiple evolutionary lineages. Using simulations, we find our new method accurately infers shared divergence events when they occur, and performs as well as current methods when divergnces are independent. We apply our new approach to genomic data from two genera of geckos from across the Philippines to test if past changes to the islands’ landscape caused bursts of speciation.

In the present study, microscopy analyses showed that excessive levels of GAs/DELLAs also modified the size and number of root tip cells in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> seedlings.

In addition, high levels of DELLAs often induced extra cells at the root epidermis, cortex, endodermis and pericycle, whereas high levels of GAs sometimes induced extra cells at the root cortex and pericycle. On the other hand, excessive levels of DELLAs enhanced the outgrowth of lateral roots in root tips, unlike excessive levels of GAs. Thus, the results of this study suggest that supra-physiological levels of GAs/DELLAs might modify the size/number of root tip cells by acting from the root sub-epidermal tissues.

Behaviorally, both age groups benefited from target pairs presented in a visual format that was congruent with how the pair was learned. While no age difference was observed in hits, the typical age-related increase in false alarms was found. Congruent with behavioral results, neither the relationship between target-related patterns of neural activity across memory phases (as measured by ERS) nor the discriminability of target classification as a function of condition at retrieval (as measured by MVPA). However, with regard to false memories, older adults exhibited overall lower pattern similarity for hits and FAs compared to hits and CRs (as measured by RSA). Additionally, Hit-FA RSA correlated with age- related increases in associative FAs across visual, frontal, and parietal cortices. Results suggest that while neural processes supporting associative memory retrieval are dependent on configural congruency between encoding and retrieval, there is no difference as to how congruency affects these processes in aging.

These cells also shared at least one unique change also found in breast tumors that overproduce cyclin E, expression of the cancer/testis antigen <italic>HORMAD1</italic>. Withdrawing cyclin E induction partially reversed the intermediate licensing phenotype of adapted cells indicating that adaptation is at least partly independent of genetic alterations. This study provides evidence that mammalian cyclin E/CDK inhibits origin licensing by an indirect mechanism through premature S phase onset. It serves as an example of specific oncogene adaptation that can identify key molecular changes during tumorigenesis.</p>",2021-07-26

Transparent barriers are an engineering control that are utilized to intercept air traveling between customers to workers. Information on the effectiveness of these barriers against aerosols is limited. In this study, a cough simulator was used to represent a cough from a customer. Two optical particle counters were used (one on each side of the barrier, labeled reference and worker) to determine the number of particles that migrated around a transparent barrier. Nine barrier sizes and a no barrier configuration were tested with six replicates each. Tests of these 10 configurations were conducted for both sitting and standing scenarios to represent configurations common to nail salons and grocery stores, respectively. Barrier efficiency was calculated using a ratio of the particle count results (reference/worker). Barriers had better efficiency when they were 9 to 39 cm (3.5 to 15.5”) above cough height and at least 91 cm (36”) wide, 92% and 93% respectively. Barriers that were 91 cm (36”) above table height for both scenarios blocked 71% or more of the particles between 0.35–0.725 µm and 68% for particles between 1 to 3 µm.

Pantropical lineages - animals and plants distributed across the three tropical continental regions of Asia, Africa, and America - provide a way to test how different environments and communities influence morphological diversification. Here, we examined a monophyletic group of frugivorous birds, the barbets and toucans (Ramphastoidea), which diversified independently on three continents, to investigate whether clades in each region exhibit similar (phylogenetically constrained) or distinct (ecologically influenced) patterns of morphological diversification. Our results show that despite differences in community dynamics in these regions, lineage accumulation patterns through time on all three continents are broadly similar, putatively due to phylogenetic niche conservatism. We quantified morphological variation in light of phylogenetic relatedness to further reveal that all barbet lineages across continents occupy a conserved region of morphospace after correcting for variation in size. However, in the Neotropics, one lineage, the toucans, have diverged dramatically from typical barbet space and converged toward (yet are distinct from) the trait space occupied by the distantly related hornbills in Asia and Africa. Additionally, we found no link between climatic variables and morphological traits. We conclude that barbets exhibit a conserved morphotype across continents and have diversified by scaling mainly in body size. However, the absence of other large frugivorous birds may have allowed toucans to diversify into a different region of morphospace of increased bill/wing to tail/wing ratios. By examining different continental lineages of a single monophyletic bird group, we shed light on the contrasting effects of regional ecological factors and phylogenetic constraints on morphological diversification.</p>",2021-07-30

We solved the crystal structure of the extracellular cysteine-rich (CRD) and Kringle (Kr) domains of ROR2 and found that, unlike other CRDs, the ROR2 CRD lacks the signature hydrophobic pocket that binds lipids/lipid-modified proteins, such as WNTs, suggesting a novel mechanism of receptor action. Functionally, we showed that the ROR2 CRD, but not other domains, is required and minimally sufficient to promote WNT5A signaling, and Robinow mutations in the CRD and the adjacent Kr alter ROR2 function. Moreover, we demonstrated that the activity of the ROR2 CRD requires Frizzled receptors.

While the organization of neuronal circuits underlying VOR is well described across vertebrates, less is known about the contribution and evolutionary origin of the OKR circuits. Moreover, the integration of these two sensory modalities is still poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel experimental model, the isolated lamprey eye-brain-labyrinth preparation, to analyze the neuronal pathways underlying visuo-vestibular integration which allowed electrophysiological recordings while applying vestibular stimulation using a moving platform, coordinated with visual stimulation via two screens. We show that lampreys exhibit robust visuo-vestibular integration, with optokinetic information processed in the pretectum and integrated with vestibular inputs at several subcortical levels. The enhanced eye movement response to multimodal stimulation favored the vestibular response at increased velocities. The optokinetic signals can be downregulated from tectum. Additionally, saccades are present in the form of nystagmus. The lamprey represents the oldest living group of vertebrates, thus all basic components of the visuo-vestibular control of gaze were present already at the dawn of vertebrate evolution.</p>",2021-08-01

This includes features such as orientation (cross-orientation suppression), eye-of-origin (interocular suppression) and spatial location (surround suppression), which are thought to involve distinct anatomical pathways. We asked if these separate routes to suppression can be differentiated by their pattern of gain control on the contrast response function measured in human participants using steady-state electroencephalography. Changes in contrast gain shift the contrast response function laterally, whereas changes in response gain scale the function vertically. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to summarise the evidence for each type of gain control. A computational meta-analysis of 16 previous studies found the most evidence for contrast gain effects with overlaid masks, but no clear evidence favouring either response gain or contrast gain for other mask types. We then conducted two new experiments, comparing suppression from four mask types (monocular and dichoptic overlay masks, and aligned and orthogonal surround masks) on responses to sine wave grating patches flickering at 5Hz. At the occipital pole, there was strong evidence for contrast gain effects in all four mask types at the first harmonic frequency (5Hz). Suppression generally became stronger at more lateral electrode sites, but there was little evidence of response gain effects. At the second harmonic frequency (10Hz) suppression was stronger overall, and involved both contrast and response gain effects. Although suppression from different mask types involves distinct anatomical pathways, gain control processes appear to serve a common purpose, which we suggest might be to suppress less reliable inputs.</p>",2021-07-27

We therefore examined whether Roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that (in other conditions) reduces inflammation while promoting host defence, might provide a beneficial effect in the context of CF. Herein, using CFTR-depleted zebrafish larvae as an innovative vertebrate model of CF immuno-pathophysiology, combined with murine and human approaches, we sought to determine the effects of Roscovitine on innate immune responses to tissue injury and pathogens in CF condition. We show that Roscovitine exerts anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution effects in neutrophilic inflammation induced by infection or tail amputation in zebrafish. Roscovitine reduces overactive epithelial ROS-mediated neutrophil trafficking, by reducing DUOX2/NADPH-oxidase activity, and accelerates inflammation resolution by inducing neutrophil apoptosis and reverse migration. Importantly, while Roscovitine efficiently enhances intracellular bacterial killing of Mycobacterium abscessus in human CF macrophages ex vivo, we found that treatment with Roscovitine results in worse infection in mouse and zebrafish models. By interfering with DUOX2/NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production, Roscovitine reduces the number of neutrophils at infection sites, and consequently compromises granuloma formation and maintenance, favouring extracellular multiplication of M. abscessus and more severe infection.

Identifying genomic regions with hypervariable ChIP/ATAC-seq signals across given samples is essential for such studies. In particular, the hypervariable regions (HVRs) across tumors from different patients indicate their heterogeneity and can contribute to revealing potential cancer subtypes and the associated epigenetic markers. We present HyperChIP as the first complete statistical tool for the task. HyperChIP uses scaled variances that account for the mean-variance dependence to rank genomic regions, and it increases the statistical power by diminishing the influence of true HVRs on model fitting. Applying it to a large pan-cancer ATAC-seq data set, we found that the identified HVRs not only provided a solid basis to uncover the underlying similarity structure among the involved tumor samples, but also led to the identification of transcription factors pertaining to the similarity structure when coupled with a motif-scanning analysis.</p>",2021-07-27

We evaluated model performance using simulated communities, computing out-of-sample predictive accuracy and parameter recovery across different input sample sizes. We applied our method to a diverse empirical community, allowing us to disentangle the direct role of environmental gradients on species’ intrinsic growth rates from indirect effects via competitive interactions.

Africa is endowed with a large flora population and traditional healers and citizens have over time depended on the use of herbs in folkloric medicine for different ailments including sickle cell disease (SCD). Such native knowledge has often formed the basis for different research exploration into the anti-sickling activities of selected African plants. These plants that have been so far investigated for their anti-sickling properties represent about 0.05 % of the 45,000 plant species enriching the flora landscape in Sub-Saharan Africa. Some of these have yielded potent anti-sickling profiles. In the current work we seek to achieve a more extensive search of the African plant diversity with anti-sickling properties: for this we have adopted a hybrid computational-cum-experimental protocol that employed computer-aided drug design (CADD) means for identifying plants with at least one constituent capable of interacting with the sickle hemoglobin, followed by extractive procedures and anti-sickling experiments for validating the predictions. Over two thousand (or 2,000) African natural products, representing over 200 plant species, were first virtually screened against the crystal structure of the dimerized human sickle hemoglobin. The natural products with the best computed sickle hemoglobin interaction energetics were found to belong to five plant species including Catharanthus roseus, Rauvolfia vomitoria, Hoslundia opposita, Lantana camara and Euphorbia hirta. The leaves of these plants were each collected subsequently and subjected to standard processing and extraction procedures. Using both HbSS polymerization inhibition and sickling reversal tests significant reductions in polymerization of erythrocyte hemolysate of the HbSS genotype were observed with the methanolic extracts of the plants, as well as sickling reversal levels of up to 68.50 % (H. opposita) was observed.</p>",2021-07-26

We found in patch-clamp bilayer recordings that Δ1-688 hTRPA1, without the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (N-ARD), was more sensitive to cold and heat, whereas Δ1-854 hTRPA1 that is also lacking the S1-S4 voltage sensing-like domain (VSLD) gained sensitivity to cold but lost its heat sensitivity. The thiol reducing agent TCEP abolished the temperature sensitivity of both Δ1-688 hTRPA1 and Δ1-854 hTRPA1. Cold and heat activity of Δ1-688 hTRPA1 and Δ1-854 hTRPA1 were associated with different structural conformational changes as revealed by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements. Heat evoked major structural rearrangement of the VSLD as well as the C-terminus domain distal to the transmembrane pore domain S5-S6 (CTD), whereas cold only caused minor conformational changes. As shown for Δ1-854 hTRPA1, a sudden drop in tryptophan fluorescence occurred within 25-20°C indicating a transition between heat and cold conformations of the CTD, and thus it is proposed that the CTD contains a bidirectional temperature switch priming hTRPA1 for either cold or heat. In whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology experiments, replacement of the cysteines 865, 1021 and 1025 with alanine modulated the cold sensitivity of hTRPA1 when heterologously expressed in HEK293T cells.

We trained mice in a selective whisker detection task, in which they learned to respond (lick) to target stimuli in one whisker field and ignore distractor stimuli in the contralateral whisker field. During expert task performance, we used widefield Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to assess prestimulus and post-stimulus neuronal activity broadly across frontal and parietal cortices. We found that lower prestimulus activity correlated with enhanced stimulus detection: lower prestimulus activity predicted response versus no response outcomes and faster reaction times. The activity predictive of trial outcome was distributed through dorsal neocortex, rather than being restricted to whisker or licking regions. Using principal component analysis, we demonstrate that response trials are associated with a distinct and less variable prestimulus neuronal subspace. For single units, prestimulus choice probability was weak yet distributed broadly, with lower than chance choice probability correlating with stronger sensory and motor encoding. These findings support a low amplitude, low variability, optimal prestimulus cortical state for stimulus detection that presents globally and predicts response outcomes for both target and distractor stimuli.</p>",2021-07-26

Anderson'}, {'name': 'Shannon K. Oda'}, {'name': 'Breanna M. Bates'}, {'name': 'Madison G. Burnett'}, {'name': 'Magdalia Rodgers Suarez'}, {'name': 'Susan L. Ruskin'}, {'name': 'Philip D. Greenberg'}]","<p>Background: In the U.S., more than 50% of ovarian cancer patients die within 5 years of diagnosis, highlighting the need for innovations such as engineered T cell therapies. Mesothelin (Msln) is an attractive immunotherapy target for this cancer, as it is overexpressed by the tumor and contributes to malignant and invasive phenotypes, making antigen loss disadvantageous to the tumor. We previously showed that adoptively transferred T cells engineered to be Msln-specific (TCR1045) preferentially accumulate within established ovarian tumors, delay tumor growth and significantly prolong survival in the ID8VEGF mouse model. However, T cell persistence and anti-tumor activity were not sustained, and we and others have previously detected FasL in the tumor vasculature and the tumor microenvironment (TME) of human and murine ovarian cancers, which can induce apoptosis in infiltrating lymphocytes expressing Fas receptor (Fas). Methods: To concurrently overcome this mechanism for potential immune evasion and enhance T cell responses, we generated an immunomodulatory fusion protein (IFP) containing the Fas extracellular binding domain fused to a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain, rather than the natural death domain. T cells engineered to express TCR1045 alone or in combination with the IFP were transferred into ID8VEGF-tumor bearing mice and evaluated for persistence, proliferation, anti-tumor cytokine production, and therapeutic efficacy. Results: Relative to T cells modified only to express TCR1045, T cells engineered to express both TCR1045 and a Fas IFP preferentially persisted in the TME of tumor-bearing mice due to improved T cell proliferation and survival. Moreover, adoptive immunotherapy with IFP+ T cells significantly prolonged survival in tumor-bearing mice, relative to TCR1045 T cells lacking the IFP. Conclusions: Fas/FasL signaling can mediate T cell death in the ovarian cancer microenvironment, as well as induce activation-induced cell death, an apoptotic mechanism responsible for regulating T cell expansion. Upregulation of FasL by tumor cells and tumor vasculature represents a mechanism for protecting growing tumors from attack by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. As many solid tumors overexpress FasL, an IFP that converts the Fas-mediated death signal into pro-survival and proliferative signals may provide an opportunity to enhance engineered adoptive T cell therapy against many malignancies.</p>",2021-07-31

Some of this can potentially be offset by improved density molecular storage. The potential of using DNA for storing data is immense. DNA can be harnessed as a high density, durable archiving medium for compressing and storing the exponentially growing quantities of digital data that mankind generates. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of DNA-based data storage systems. These include exploration of different encoding and error correction schemes and the use of different technologies for DNA synthesis and sequencing. Recently, the use of composite DNA letters has been demonstrated to leverage the inherent redundancy in DNA based storage systems to achieve higher logical density, offering a more cost-effective approach. However, the suggested composite DNA approach is still limited due to its sensitivity to the stochastic nature of the process. Combinatorial assembly methods were also suggested to encode information on DNA in high density, while avoding the challenges of the stochastic system. These are based on enzynatic assembly processes for producing the synthetic DNA. In this paper, we propose a novel method to encode information into DNA molecules using combinatorial encoding and shortmer DNA synthesis, in compatibility with current chemical DNA synthesis technologies. Our approach is based on a set of easily distinguishable DNA shortmers serving as building blocks and allowing for near-zero error rates. We construct an extended combinatorial alphabet in which every letter is a subset of the set of building blocks. We suggest different combinatorial encoding schemes and explore their theoretical properties and practical implications in terms of error probabilities and required sequencing depth. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we implemented an end-to-end computer simulation of a DNA-based storage system, using our suggested combinatorial encodings. We use simulations to assess the performance of the system and the effect of different parameters. Our simulations suggest that our combinatorial approach can potentially achieve up to 6.5-fold increase in the logical density over standard DNA based storage systems, with near zero reconstruction error. Implementing our approach at scale to perform actual synthesis, requires minimal alterations to current technologies. Our work thus suggests that the combination of combinatorial encoding with standard DNA chemical synthesis technologies can potentially improve current solutions, achieving scalable, efficient and cost- effective DNA-based storage.</p>",2021-08-01

In turn, GM3 is extended by other glycosyltransferases to generate nearly all the complex gangliosides enriched in neural tissue. Pathogenic mechanisms that account for neural phenotypes associated with GM3SD are not known. To explore how loss of GM3 impacts neural-specific glycolipid glycosylation and cell signaling, GM3SD patient fibroblasts bearing one of two different ST3GAL5 variants were reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and then differentiated to neural crest cells (NCCs). GM3 and GM3-derived gangliosides were undetectable in iPSCs and NCCs from both variants, while LacCer precursor levels were elevated compared to wildtype (WT). NCCs of both variants synthesized elevated levels of neutral lacto- and globo-series, as well as minor alternatively sialylated, GSLs compared to WT. Shifts in ceramide profiles associated with iPSC and NCC GSLs were also detected in GM3SD variants. Altered GSL profiles in the GM3SD cells were accompanied by dynamic changes in the cell surface proteome, protein O-GlcNAcylation, and receptor tyrosine kinase abundance. GM3SD cells also exhibited increased apoptosis and sensitivity to erlotnib, an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. Pharmacologic inhibition of O-GlcNAcase increased protein O-GlcNAcylation and significantly rescued baseline and erlotnib-induced apoptosis. Collectively, these findings indicate broad effects on cell signaling during differentiation of GM3SD patient-derived iPSCs to NCCs. Thus, human GM3SD cells provide a novel platform to investigate structure/function relationships that connect GSL diversity to cell signaling, cell survival, and neural differentiation.</p>",2021-07-30

Van Raamsdonk'}]","<p>Different melanoma subtypes exhibit specific and non-overlapping sets of oncogene and tumor suppressor mutations, despite a common cell of origin in melanocytes. For example, activation of the Gα<sub>q/11</sub> signaling pathway is a characteristic initiating event in primary melanomas that arise in the dermis, uveal tract or central nervous system. It is rare in melanomas arising in the epidermis. Here, we present evidence that in the mouse, crosstalk with the epidermal microenvironment actively impairs the survival of melanocytes expressing the GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> oncogene, providing a new model for oncogene specificity in cancer. The presence of epidermal cells inhibited cell division and fragmented dendrites of melanocytes expressing GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> in culture, while they promoted the growth of normal melanocytes. Differential gene expression analysis of FACS sorted epidermal melanocytes showed that cells expressing GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> exhibit an oxidative stress and apoptosis signature previously linked to vitiligo. Furthermore, PLCB4, the direct downstream effector of Gα<sub>q/11</sub> signaling, is frequently mutated in cutaneous melanoma alongside P53 and NF1. Our results suggest that a deficiency of PLCB4 promotes cutaneous melanomagenesis by reducing GNAQ driven signaling. Hence, our studies reveal the flip side of the GNAQ/PLCB4 signaling pathway, which was hitherto unsuspected. In the future, understanding how epidermal crosstalk restrains the GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> oncogene could suggest novel melanoma therapies.</p>",2021-07-26

We analyzed several datasets including the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), an independent dataset from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine (UPenn), the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset. PPMI and ADNI were partitioned to train (70%), validate (20%), and test (10%) a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for PD and AD classification. The UPenn and OASIS datasets were used as independent test sets to evaluate the model performance during inference. We also implemented a random forest classifier as a baseline model by extracting key radiomics features from the same T1-weighted MRI scans. The proposed 3D CNN model was trained from scratch for the classification tasks. For AD classification, the 3D CNN model achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.878 on the ADNI test set and an average ROC-AUC of 0.789 on the OASIS dataset. For PD classification, the proposed 3D CNN model achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.667 on the PPMI test set and an average ROC-AUC of 0.743 on the UPenn dataset. We also found that model performance was largely maintained when using only 25% of the training dataset. The 3D CNN outperformed the random forest classifier for both the PD and AD tasks. The 3D CNN also generalized better on unseen MRI data from different imaging centers. Our results show that the proposed 3D CNN model was less prone to overfitting for AD than for PD classification. This approach shows promise for screening of PD and AD patients using only T1-weighted brain MRI, which is relatively widely available. This model with additional validation could also be used to help differentiate between challenging cases of AD and PD when they present with similarly subtle motor and non-motor symptoms.</p>",2021-07-27

When the culture was washed to remove organic acids from prior additions of exogenous electron donor and only CF and DCM were added, the culture completely dechlorinated CF. The total amount of DCM added was not sufficient to provide the electron equivalents needed to reduce CF to DCM. Thus, the additional reducing power came via the DCM generated from CF reduction.

Specifically, Woelfle et al. have reported that DNA supercoiling of an endogenous plasmid became progressively higher during prolonged dark phases in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. This is counterintuitive, since higher levels of negative DNA supercoiling are commonly associated with exponential growth and high metabolic flux. Vijayan et al. then have reverted the interpretation of plasmid mobility on agarose gels supplemented with chloroquine diphosphate (CQ), but not further discussed the differences. Here, we set out to clarify this open issue in cyanobacterial DNA supercoiling dynamics. We first re-capitulate Keller's band counting method (1975, PNAS) using CQ instead of ethidium bromide as the intercalating agent. A 500x-1000x higher CQ concentration is required in the DNA relaxation reaction (topoisomerase I) than in the agarose gel buffer to quench all negative supercoiling of pUC19 extracted from Escherichia coli. This is likely due to the dependence of both, the DNA binding affinity of CQ and the induced DNA unwinding angle, on the ionic strength of the buffer. Lower levels of CQ were required to fully relax in vivo pUC19 supercoiling than were used by Woelfle et al. Next, we analyzed the in vivo supercoiling of endogenous plasmids of Synechocystis sp.

The weekly body mass gain of <italic>Npgl</italic>-overexpressing mice was higher than that of controls until 7 weeks from induction of overexpression, after which it ceased to be so. Oral glucose tolerance tests showed that <italic>Npgl</italic> overexpression maintained glucose tolerance and increased blood insulin levels, and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests showed that it maintained insulin sensitivity. At the experimental endpoint, <italic>Npgl</italic> overexpression was associated with increased mass of the perirenal white adipose tissue (WAT) and decreased mass of the epididymal WAT (eWAT), resulting in little effect on the total WAT mass. These results suggest that under long-term HFD 60 feeding, <italic>Npgl</italic> overexpression may play a role in avoiding metabolic disturbance both by accelerating energy storage and by suppressing excess fat accumulation in certain tissues, such as the eWAT.</p>",2021-07-26

Wolfson'}]","<label>1</label><title>Abstract</title><p>The cryo-EM resolution revolution enables the development of algorithms for direct de-novo modelling of protein structures from given cryo-EM density maps. Deep Learning tools have been applied to locate structure patterns, such as rotamers, secondary structures and C<italic>α</italic> atoms. We present a deep neural network (nicknamed SegmA) for the residue type segmentation of a cryo-EM density map. The network labels voxels in a cryo-EM map by the residue type (amino acid type or nucleic acid) of the sampled macromolecular structure. It also provides a visual representation of the density map by coloring the different types of voxels by their assgned colors. SegmA’s algorithm combines a rotation equivariant group convolutional network with a traditional U-net network in a cascade. In addition SegmA estimates the labeling accuracy and reports only labels assigned with high confidence. At resolution of 3<italic>Å</italic> SegmAs accuracy is 80% for nucleotides. Amino acids which can be seen by eye, such as LEU, ARG and PHE, are detected by Segma with about 70% accuracy.</p><p>A web server of the application is under development at <ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" ext-link-type=""uri"" xlink:href=""https://dev.dcsh7cbr3o89e.amplifyapp.com"">https://dev.dcsh7cbr3o89e.amplifyapp.com</ext-link>.

Grogan'}, {'name': 'Matthias Raemaekers'}, {'name': 'Maaike M. H. Van Swieten'}, {'name': 'Alexander L. Green'}, {'name': 'Martin J. Gillies'}, {'name': 'Sanjay G. Manohar'}]","<p>Motivation depends on dopamine, but might be modulated by acetylcholine which influences dopamine release in the striatum, and amplifies motivation in animal studies. A corresponding effect in humans would be important clinically, since anticholinergic drugs are frequently used in Parkinson’s disease, a condition that can also disrupt motivation. Reward and dopamine make us more ready to respond, as indexed by reaction times (RT), and move faster, sometimes termed vigour. These effects may be controlled by preparatory processes that can be tracked using EEG. We measured vigour in a placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of trihexyphenidyl (THP), a muscarinic antagonist, with an incentivised eye movement task and EEG. Participants responded faster and with greater vigour when incentives were high, but THP blunted these motivation effects, suggesting that muscarinic receptors facilitate invigoration by reward. Preparatory EEG build-up (contingent negative variation; CNV) was strengthened by high incentives and by muscarinic blockade. The amplitude of preparatory activity predicted both vigour and RT, although over distinct scalp regions. Frontal activity predicted vigour, whereas a larger, earlier, central component predicted RT. Indeed the incentivisation of RT was partly mediated by the CNV, though vigour was not. Moreover, the CNV mediated the drug’s effect on dampening incentives, suggesting that muscarinic receptors underlie the motivational influence on this preparatory activity. Taken together, these findings show that a muscarinic blocker used to treat Parkinson’s disease impairs motivated action in healthy people, and that medial frontal preparatory neural activity mediates this for RT.</p>",2021-07-29

This failure can be related to a phenotype of accelerated aging. In this work we considered 76 subjects with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and 83 healthy controls. We evaluated two measures that can be informative of the rate of aging, i.e. whole blood DNA methylation using the Illumina Infinium EPIC array and plasma levels of a selection of inflammatory/immunological proteins using Multiplex Immunoassays. We demonstrated accelerated aging in terms of the most common epigenetic age estimators in CKD patients. We developed a new predictor of age based on inflammatory/immunological profile (ipAGE) and confirmed age acceleration in CKD patients. Finally, we evaluated the relationship between epigenetic age predictors and ipAGE and further identified the inflammatory/immunological biomarkers differentially expressed between cases and controls. In summary, our data show an accelerated aging phenotype in CKD patients sustained by inflammatory processes.</p>",2021-07-26
