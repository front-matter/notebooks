Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs. We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2·0 tool. Inverse variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up were conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs. controls (RR 0.37, 95%CI 0.12 to 1.13, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs, severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroups by severity of COVID-19 or RoB were mostly consistent with main analyses; all-cause mortality in three RCTs at high RoB was reduced with IVM. Sensitivity analyses excluding RCTs with follow up &lt;21 days showed no difference in all-cause mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In comparison to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease. IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to treat COVID-19 patients.</p></sec>",2021-05-25

Locomotor activity was decreased (distance, speed, time-mobile) by 30 min inhalation of THC.

Here we use the dense genomic surveillance generated by the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium to reconstruct the dynamics of 62 different lineages in each of 315 English local authorities between September 2020 and April 2021. This analysis reveals a series of sub-epidemics that peaked in the early autumn of 2020, followed by a singular jump in transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 lineage. B.1.1.7 grew when other lineages declined during the second national lockdown and regionally tiered restrictions between November and December 2020. A third more stringent national lockdown eventually suppressed B.1.1.7 and eliminated nearly all other lineages in early 2021. However, a series of variants (mostly containing the spike E484K mutation) defied these trends and persisted at moderately increasing proportions. Accounting for sustained introductions, however, indicates that their transmissibility is unlikely to exceed that of B.1.1.7. Finally, B.1.617.2 was repeatedly introduced to England and grew rapidly in April 2021, constituting approximately 40% of sampled COVID-19 genomes on May 15.</p>",2021-05-26

B.1.617 and its sublineages contain a constellation of S mutations including the substitution P681R predicted to further optimise this furin cleavage site. In this short report we provide experimental evidence that virus of the B.1.617 lineage has enhanced S cleavage, that enhanced processing of an expressed B.1.617 S protein in cells is due to P681R, and that this mutation enables more efficient cleavage of a peptide mimetic of the B.1.617 S1/S2 cleavage site by recombinant furin.

In these cases, a single causal variant is often assumed to underlie the association, however no systematic assessment of the number of causal variants has been performed. In this study, we applied a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) in lymphoblastoid cells to functionally evaluate 49,256 allelic pairs, representing 30,893 genetic variants in high, local linkage disequilibrium for 744 independent cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and assessed each for colocalization across 114 traits. We identified 3,536 allele-independent regulatory regions containing 907 allele-specific regulatory variants, and found that 17.3% of eQTL contained more than one significant allelic effect. We show that detected regulatory variants are highly and specifically enriched for activating chromatin structures and allelic transcription factor binding, for which ETS-domain family members are a large driver. Integration of MPRA profiles with eQTL/complex trait colocalizations identified causal variant sets for associations with blood cell measurements, Multiple Sclerosis, Irritable Bowel Disease, and Crohn’s Disease.

In spiral cleavage – a stereotypic developmental programme ancestral to 14, nearly half, of the major animal groups (e.g., molluscs, annelids and flatworms), a cell known as the D-quadrant organiser defines cell fates and the body axes. ERK1/2 specifies the embryonic organiser in molluscs, yet how this signalling cascade exerts organising activity and whether this role is conserved in other spiral cleaving groups is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that ERK1/2 promotes the specification and inductive activity of the D-quadrant organiser in <italic>Owenia fusiformis</italic>, an early-branching annelid exhibiting ancestral developmental traits. In this species, active di-phosphorylated ERK1/2 mediated by FGF receptor activity localises to the 4d micromere, establishing the bilateral symmetry and specifying the hindgut and trunk mesodermal progenitor.

Although lack of these proteins causes extreme sensitivity to alkylation stress, cellular heterogeneity in DNA alkylation repair provides a functional benefit by increasing the evolvability of the whole population. We demonstrated this by monitoring the dynamics of nascent mutations during alkylation stress as well as the frequency of fixed mutations that are generated by the distinct subpopulations of the adaptive response.

There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that empirical fitness functions display substantial sparsity when represented in terms of epistatic interactions. Moreover, the theory of Compressed Sensing provides scaling laws for the number of samples required to exactly recover a sparse function. Motivated by these results, we study the sparsity of fitness functions sampled from a generalization of the NK model, a widely-used random field model of fitness functions. In particular, we present theoretical results that allow us to test the effect of the Generalized NK (GNK) model’s interpretable parameters—sequence length, alphabet size, and assumed interactions between sequence positions—on the sparsity of fitness functions sampled from the model and, consequently, the number of measurements required to exactly recover these functions.

Unexpectedly, force slows the rate of filament nucleation by promoting the interaction of nucleation promoting factors with actin filament ends, limiting branch formation. This inhibition is countered by an even larger force-induced drop in the rate of filament capping, resulting in a shift in the balance between nucleation and capping that increases network density. Remarkably, the force dependence of capping is identical to that of filament elongation because they require the same size gap to appear between the filament and load for insertion.

Using a mTBI mouse model, 2-photon imaging, an endothelial cell-specific genetic ablation approach, and serum-free primary astrocyte cultures, we demonstrated that areas with atypical astrocytes coincide with BBB damage and that exposure of astrocytes to plasma proteins is sufficient to initiate downregulation of astrocyte homeostatic proteins. While mTBI resulted in frequent impairment of both physical and metabolic BBB properties and leakage of small-sized blood-borne factors, deposition of the coagulation factor fibrinogen or vessel rupture were rare.

Other condensates are multiphasic, with nested liquid phases of distinct compositions and functions, such as in the case of ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus. The size and structure of such condensates must be regulated for proper biological function. We leveraged a bio-inspired approach to discover how amphiphilic, surfactant-like proteins may contribute to the structure and size regulation of biomolecular condensates. We designed and examined families of amphiphilic proteins comprising one phase-separating domain and one non-phase separating domain. In particular, these proteins contain the soluble structured domain glutathione S-transferase (GST) or maltose binding protein (MBP), fused to the intrinsically disordered RGG domain from P granule protein LAF-1. When one amphiphilic protein is mixed in vitro with RGG-RGG, the proteins assemble into enveloped condensates, with RGG-RGG at the core, and the amphiphilic protein forming the surface film layer. Importantly, we found that MBP-based amphiphiles are surfactants and control droplet size, with increasing surfactant concentration resulting in smaller droplet radii. In contrast, GST-based amphiphiles at increased concentrations co-assemble with RGG-RGG into multiphasic structures. We propose a mechanism for these experimental observations, supported by molecular simulations of a minimalist model.

Although essential to the design of quantitative experiments, the dynamic range of SMLM counting techniques has not yet been studied in detail. Here we provide a working definition of the dynamic range for quantitative SMLM in terms of the relative number of missed localizations or blinks, and explore the photophysical and experimental parameters that affect it. We begin with a simple two-state model of blinking fluorophores, then extend the model to incorporate photobleaching and temporal binning by the detection camera. From these models, we first show that our estimates of the dynamic range agree with realistic simulations of the photoswitching. We find that the dynamic range scales inversely with the duty cycle when counting both blinks and localizations.

Here, we report a dose-response relationship between maternal glucose levels and phenotypic severity of CHD in offspring, using a chemically-induced pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM) mouse model. Embryos from dams with low-level maternal hyperglycemia (matHG) displayed trabeculation defects, ventricular wall thinning, and ventricular septal defects (VSD). On the other hand, embryos from dams with high-level matHG display outflow tract malformations, ventricular wall thinning and an increased rate of VSD. Our findings show that increasing levels of matHG exacerbates CHD occurrence and severity in offspring compared to control embryos. We applied single-cell RNA- sequencing to define matHG-related transcriptional differences in E9.5 and E11.5 hearts as comparing to controls.

Collins'}, {'name': 'Martin Ester'}]","<p>Data discrepancy between preclinical and clinical datasets poses a major challenge for accurate drug response prediction based on gene expression data. Different methods of transfer learning have been proposed to address this data discrepancy. These methods generally use cell lines as source domains and patients, patient-derived xenografts, or other cell lines as target domains. However, they assume that they have access to the target domain during training or fine-tuning and they can only take labeled source domains as input. The former is a strong assumption that is not satisfied during deployment of these models in the clinic. The latter means these methods rely on labeled source domains which are of limited size. To avoid this assumption, we formulate drug response prediction as an out-of-distribution generalization problem which does not assume that the target domain is accessible during training. Moreover, to exploit unlabeled source domain data, which tends to be much more plentiful than labeled data, we adopt a semi-supervised approach. We propose Velodrome, a semi-supervised method of out-of-distribution generalization that takes labeled and unlabeled data from different resources as input and makes generalizable predictions. Velodrome achieves this goal by introducing an objective function that combines a supervised loss for accurate prediction, an alignment loss for generalization, and a consistency loss to incorporate unlabeled samples. Our experimental results demonstrate that Velodrome outperforms state-of-the-art pharmacogenomics and transfer learning baselines on cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, and patients and therefore, may guide precision oncology more accurately.</p>",2021-05-26

Genomic estimates of the inbreeding coefficients are preferred to pedigree-based estimators as they measure the realized inbreeding levels and they are more robust to pedigree errors. Several methods identifying homozygous-by-descent (HBD) segments with hidden Markov models (HMM) have been recently developed and are particularly valuable when the information is degraded or heterogeneous (e.g., low-fold sequencing, low marker density, heterogeneous genotype quality or variable marker spacing). We previously developed a multiple HBD class HMM where HBD segments are classified in different groups based on their length (e.g., recent versus old HBD segments) but we recently observed that for high inbreeding levels with many HBD segments, the estimated contributions might be biased towards more recent classes (i.e., associated with large HBD segments) although the overall estimated level of inbreeding remained unbiased. We herein propose an updated multiple HBD classes model in which the HBD classification is modeled in successive nested levels. In each level, the rate specifying the expected length of HBD segments, and that is directly related to the number of generations to the ancestors, is distinct. The non-HBD classes are now modeled as a mixture of HBD segments from later generations and shorter non-HBD segments (i.e., both with higher rates). The updated model had better statistical properties and performed better on simulated data compared to our previous version. We also show that the parameters of the model are easier to interpret and that the model is more robust to the choice of the number of classes. Overall, the new model results in an improved partitioning of inbreeding in different HBD classes and should be preferred in applications relying on the length of estimated HBD segments.</p>",2021-05-25

SITE-Seq is an unbiased method applicable for the in vitro detection of double-strand breaks (DSBs). To analyze SITE-Seq data, we developed a novel Galaxy system, which can perform simple and reproducible analyses without a command line operation. We conducted a SITE-Seq analysis of a rice genome modified by OsFH15 gRNA-Cas9, and identified 41 DSB sites in the annotated regions. Amplicon-sequencing revealed mutations at one off-target site in the genome-edited rice.

Of the six tested programs, only CRISPRdirect predicted this off-target site, but it also predicted 6,080 off-target sites in total.

One potential confound of these studies is that both explicit and implicit processes were allowed to operate concurrently, which may interact, potentially in opposition.

We confirmed that implicit adaptation is in the wrong direction for mirror-reversal and operates as if the perturbation were a rotation, and only showed a moderate attenuation after three days of training. This result raised the question of whether implicit adaptation blindly operates as though perturbations were a rotation. In a separate experiment, which directly compared a mirror-reversal and a rotation, we found that implicit adaptation operates in a proper coordinate system for different perturbations: adaptation to a mirror-reversal and rotational perturbation is more consistent with Cartesian and polar coordinate systems, respectively.

The new photoswitchable ligands produced photocurrents in untransfected neurons upon covalently tethering to endogenous glutamate receptors and activating them reversibly with visible light pulses of few milliseconds. As a proof of concept of these molecular prostheses, we apply them to the ultrafast synapses of auditory neurons of the cochlea that encode sound and provide auditory input to the brain.

Alderson'}, {'name': 'Andre Altmann'}, {'name': 'Sepideh Sadaghiani'}]","<p>The brain’s functional connectivity architecture (functional connectome) is dynamic, constantly reconfiguring in an individual-specific manner and contributing to inter-individual variability in cognitive performances. However, to what extent genetic effects shape the dynamic reconfigurations of the functional connectome is largely unknown. This paper assesses whether dynamic connectome features are heritable, quantifies their heritability, and explores their association with cognitive phenotypes. We identified discrete connectome states from resting-state fMRI data (n = 1003 including twins and non-twin siblings) and obtained multivariate features, each describing temporal or spatial characteristics of connectome dynamics. We found strong evidence that the temporal features, particularly fractional occupancy (FO) and transition probability (TP), were heritable. Importantly, a substantial proportion of phenotypic variance of these features (35% of FO and 41% of TP) was explained by genetic effects. The effect was stable after adjusting for head motion, independent of global signal regression and the chosen number of states, and absent in surrogate data. Contrarily, the data did not provide robust support for heritability of spatial features suggesting that genetic effects primarily contribute to how the connectome <italic>transitions</italic> across states, rather than the precise way in which the states are spatially instantiated. Notably, temporal phenotypes also captured variability in cognitive performance. Overall, our findings demonstrate a link between genetic makeup and temporal reconfigurations of the functional connectome, suggesting that dynamic features may act as endophenotypes for cognitive abilities. In conclusion, we propose that connectome dynamics offer considerable potential as a theoretical, conceptual, and practical framework for linking genetics to behavior.</p>",2021-05-24

We identified positive selection evidences that support the adaptiveness of 203K/204R variants. The R203K/G204R mutant virus was created and compared with the native virus. The virus competition experiments show that 203K/204R variants possess a replication advantage over the preceding R203/G204 variants, possibly in relation to the ribonucleocapsid (RNP) assemble during the virus replication.

Studies have shown that two of the four domains of EndoS2, the carbohydrate binding module (CBM) and the glycoside hydrolase (GH) domain site are critical for catalytic activity. To yield structural insights into contributions of the CBM and the GH domains, as well as the overall flexibility of EndoS2, to the proteins’ catalytic activity, models of EndoS2-Fc complexes were generated through enhanced-sampling molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation and site-identification by ligand competitive saturation (SILCS) docking followed by reconstruction and long-time MD simulations.

Increased stress-like behavior was only observed when fish were subjected to ELS within a precise time window in early development, revealing a temporal critical window of sensitivity. Moreover, enhanced anxiety-like behavior only emerges after two months post-ELS, revealing a developmentally specified delay in the effects of ELS. ELS leads to increased levels of baseline cortisol, and resulted in a dysregulation of cortisol receptors, suggesting long-term effects on cortisol signaling.

Comparisons of inoculated with uninoculated media can be used to provide direct biochemical observations on depleted and secreted metabolites which can be used to predict resource competition, cross-feeding and secondary metabolite production in microbial isolates and communities. This approach is most powerful when used with defined media that enable tracking of all depleted metabolites. However, microbial growth media have traditionally been developed for the isolation and growth of microorganisms but not metabolite utilization profiling through LC-MS/MS. Here, we describe the construction of a defined medium, the Northen Lab Defined Medium (NLDM), that not only supports the growth of diverse bacteria but is defined and therefore suited for exometabolomic experiments. Metabolites included in NLDM were selected based on their presence in R2A medium and soil, elemental stoichiometry requirements, as well as knowledge of metabolite usage by different bacteria. We found that NLDM supported the growth of 53 phylogenetically diverse soil bacterial isolates and all of its metabolites were trackable through LC–MS/MS analysis.

With an ever-increasing acreage of croplands with suboptimal available soil phosphorus, genetic improvement of sorghum germplasm for enhanced phosphorus acquisition from soil is crucial to increasing agricultural output and reducing inputs, while confronted with a growing world population and uncertain climate. Sorghum bicolor is a globally important commodity for food, fodder, and forage. Known for robust tolerance to heat, drought, and other abiotic stresses, its capacity for optimal phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) is still being investigated for optimized root system architectures (RSA). Whilst a few RSA-influencing genes have been identified in sorghum and other grasses, the epigenetic impact on expression and tissue-specific activation of candidate PUE genes remains elusive. Here, we present transcriptomic, epigenetic, and regulatory network profiling of RSA modulation in the BTx623 sorghum background in response to limiting phosphorus (LP) conditions. We show that during LP, sorghum RSA is remodeled to increase root length and surface area, likely enhancing its ability to acquire P. Global DNA 5-methylcytosine and H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation levels decrease in response to LP, while H3K4me3 peaks and DNA hypomethylated regions contain recognition motifs of numerous developmental and nutrient responsive transcription factors that display disparate expression patterns between different root tissues (primary root apex, elongation zone, and lateral root apex). Suggesting that epigenetic shifts during growth on LP results in targeted gene expression in a tissue-specific manner that optimizes the RSA for improved P uptake.</p><sec><title>Summary</title><p>In response to low P, epigenetic and transcriptional changes stimulate lateral root growth in Sorghum bicolor BTx623, increasing the root surface area for enhanced “mining” of P from the soil.</p></sec>",2021-05-25

Constable'}, {'name': 'Hanna Kokko'}]","<p>Recently, it was pointed out [1] that classic models for the evolution of anisogamy do not take into account the possibility of parthenogenetic reproduction, even though sex is facultative in many relevant taxa (e.g. algae) that harbour both anisogamous and isogamous species. Here we complement the analysis of [1] with an approach where we assume that the relationship between progeny size and its survival may differ between parthenogenetically and sexually produced progeny, favouring either the former or the latter. We show that the findings of [1], that parthenogenesis can stabilise isogamy relative to the obligate sex case, extend to our scenarios. We additionally investigate two different ways for one mating type to take over the entire population. First, parthenogenesis can lead to biased sex ratios that are sufficiently extreme that one type can displace the other, leading to de facto asexuality for the remaining type that now lacks partners to fuse with. This process involves positive feedback: microgametes, being numerous, lack opportunities for syngamy, and should they proliferate parthenogenetically, the next generation makes this asexual route even more prominent for microgametes. Second, we consider mutations to strict asexuality in producers of micro- or macrogametes, and show that the prospects of asexual invasion depend strongly on the mating type in which the mutation arises. Perhaps most interestingly, we also find scenarios in which parthenogens have an intrinsic survival advantage yet facultatively sexual isogamous populations are robust to the invasion of asexuals, despite us assuming no genetic benefits of recombination. Here equal contribution from both mating types to zygotes that are sufficiently well provisioned to outweigh the additional costs associated with syngamy.</p>",2021-05-26

Patients who eventually died from COVID-19 received CCP significantly later (3.95 versus 5.22 days after hospital admission) and had higher interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels (28.9 pg/ml versus 102.5 pg/ml) than those who survived. In addition, CCP-transfusion caused a significant reduction in the overall inflammatory status of the patients regardless of the severity of disease or outcome, as evidenced by decreasing C-reactive protein, IL6 and ferritin levels.

As such, exploration of variants that modify RAD21 enhancer activity, across the genome, may also provide insights into mechanisms by which distinct variants impact healthy human development and disease. We searched 42,953,834 genomic variants for a spatial-eQTL association with the transcription of RAD21. We identified 123 significant associations (FDR &lt; 0.05), which are local (cis) or long-distance (trans) regulators of RAD21 expression. The 123 variants co-regulate a further seven genes, enriched for having Sp2 transcription factor binding sites in their promoter regions. The Sp2 transcription factor and six of the seven genes had previously been associated with cancer onset, progression, and metastasis. Our results suggest that genome-wide variation in non-coding regions impacts on RAD21 transcript levels in addition to other genes, which then could impact on oncogenesis and the process of ubiquitination.

Predicting the hydrogen bonding network from the sequence, also referred to as RNA secondary structure prediction or RNA folding, is a nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP)-complete computational problem. The structure of the molecule is strongly predictive of its functions and biochemical properties, and therefore the ability to accurately predict the structure is a crucial tool for biochemists. Many methods have been proposed to efficiently sample possible secondary structure patterns. Classic approaches employ dynamic programming, and recent studies have explored approaches inspired by evolutionary algorithms. This work demonstrates leveraging quantum computing hardware to predict the secondary structure of RNA. A Hamiltonian written in the form of a Binary Quadratic Model (BQM) is derived to drive the system toward maximizing the number of base pairs while simultaneously maximizing the average length of the stems. An Adiabatic Quantum Computer (AQC) is compared to a Replica Exchange Monte Carlo (REMC) algorithm programmed with the same objective function, with the AQC being shown to be highly competitive at rapidly identifying low energy solutions. The method proposed in this study was compared to three algorithms from literature and was found to have the highest success rate.</p>",2021-05-29

In the present study, we first conducted species-delimitation with aids of morphological data as well DNA barcodes (nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial COI, i.e., cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, gene), for a huge sample of Dichaetophora and allied taxa (genus Mulgravea and subgenus Dudaica of Drosophila) collected from a wide geographical range. Then, multiple-locus phylogenetic reconstruction was conducted based on elaborate taxon sampling from the known and newly recognized species in the above taxa, with the maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) methods. As a result, 189 species (186 of Dichaetophora, 2 of Mulgravea, and 1 for Dudaica) were newly recognized. In our ML and BI trees, several well-supported species clusters equivalent to the species groups agbo (excluding of neocirricauda), tenuicauda, sinensis (inclusive of neocirricauda) and trilobita of Dichaetophora, were recovered, with the sister-relationship between the third and fourth proved. Other well-supported clusters include 1) a clade comprising of Di. acutissima group and Dudaica, with the former proved to be paraphyletic to the latter; 2) genus Mulgravea; 3) a clade comprising exclusively of newly recognized Dichaetophora species, and was placed as sister to Mulgravea. Three of the remaining five representatives of Dichaetophora species form a solid cluster, leaving the positions of the last two unresolved.
