Evidence suggests that the virus is evolving to allow efficient spread through the human population, including vaccinated individuals. Here we report a study of viral variants from surveillance of the Delaware Valley, including the city of Philadelphia, and variants infecting vaccinated subjects. We sequenced and analyzed complete viral genomes from 2621 surveillance samples from March 2020 to September 2021 and compared them to genome sequences from 159 vaccine breakthroughs. In the early spring of 2020, all detected variants were of the B.1 and closely related lineages. A mixture of lineages followed, notably including B.1.243 followed by B.1.1.7 (alpha), with other lineages present at lower levels. Later isolations were dominated by B.1.617.2 (delta) and other delta lineages; delta was the exclusive variant present by the last time sampled. To investigate whether any variants appeared preferentially in vaccine breakthroughs, we devised a model based on Bayesian autoregressive moving average logistic multinomial regression to allow rigorous comparison. This revealed that B.1.617.2 (delta) showed three-fold enrichment in vaccine breakthrough cases (odds ratio of 3; 95% credible interval 0.89-11). Viral point substitutions could also be associated with vaccine breakthroughs, notably the N501Y substitution found in the alpha, beta and gamma variants (odds ratio 2.04; 95% credible interval of 1.25-3.18).

Short-read polishing tools can use short reads to fix these errors, but most rely on short-read alignment which is unreliable in repeat regions.

Here we introduce Polypolish, a new short-read polisher which uses all-per-read alignments to repair errors in repeat sequences that other polishers cannot.

In this work, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map the brain areas involved in anesthesia-induced burst-suppression across four mammalian species: humans, long-tailed macaques, common marmosets, and rats. At first, we determined the fMRI signatures of burst-suppression in human EEG-fMRI data. Applying this method to animal fMRI datasets, we found distinct burst-suppression signatures in all species. The burst-suppression maps revealed a marked inter-species difference: in rats the entire neocortex engaged in burst-suppression, while in primates most sensory areas were excluded—predominantly the primary visual cortex.

This behavior extends to remodeling the extracellular polymer matrix that encases biofilms and tissues, where constituent cells dictate spatiotemporal network properties including stiffness, pattern formation, and transport properties. The majority of synthetic polymer networks cannot recreate these phenomena due to their lack of autonomous centralized actuators (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., cells). In addition, non-living polymer networks that perform computation are generally restricted to a few inputs (<italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., light, pH, enzymes), limiting the logical complexity available to a single network chemistry. Toward synergizing the advantages of living and synthetic systems, engineered living materials leverage genetic and metabolic programming to establish control over material-wide properties. Here we demonstrate that a bacterial metal respiration mechanism, extracellular electron transfer (EET), can control metal-catalyzed radical cross-linking of polymer networks. Linking metabolic electron flux to a synthetic redox catalyst allows dynamic, tunable, and predictable control over material formation and bulk polymer network mechanics using genetic circuits. By programming key EET genes with transcriptional Boolean logic, we rationally design computational networks that sense-and-respond to multiple inputs in biological contexts. Finally, we capitalize on the wide reactivity of EET and redox catalyses to predictably control another class of living synthetic materials using copper(I) alkyne-azide cycloaddition click chemistry. Our results demonstrate the utility of EET as a bridge for controlling abiotic materials and how the design rules of synthetic biology can be applied to emulate physiological behavior in polymer networks.</p>",2021-10-17

Recently, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) isolated from breastmilk were found to inhibit GBS growth and biofilm formation in vitro, and women that make certain HMOs are less likely to be vaginally colonized with GBS. Using in vitro human vaginal epithelial cells and a murine vaginal colonization model, we tested the impact of HMO treatment on GBS burdens and the composition of the endogenous microbiota by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. HMO treatment reduced GBS vaginal burdens in vivo with minimal alterations to the vaginal microbiota. HMOs displayed potent inhibitory activity against GBS in vitro, but HMO pretreatment did not alter adherence of GBS or the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus to human vaginal epithelial cells. Additionally, disruption of a putative GBS glycosyltransferase (Δsan_0913) rendered the bacterium largely resistant to HMO inhibition in vitro and in vivo but did not compromise its adherence, colonization, or biofilm formation in the absence of HMOs.

To date, we have begun to define the contributions of 14-3-3ζ in adipocytes, but whether 14-3-3ζ has additional metabolic roles in other cell types, such as the pancreatic β-cell, is unclear. We previously documented a pro-survival role of 14-3-3ζ in MIN6 insulinoma cells, as depletion of 14-3-3ζ induced cell death, but paradoxically, whole-body deletion of 14-3-3ζ in mice resulted in significantly enlarged β-cell area with no effects on insulin secretion. To better understand the role of 14-3-3ζ in β-cells, we generated β-cell-specific 14-3-3ζ knockout (β14-3-3ζKO) mice, and while no differences in β-cell mass were observed, β14-3-3ζKO mice displayed potentiated insulin secretion due to enhanced mitochondrial function and ATP synthesis. Deletion of 14-3-3ζ led to profound changes to the β-cell transcriptome, where pathways associated with mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation were upregulated. Acute treatment of mouse islets and human islets with pan-14-3-3 inhibitors recapitulated the potentiation in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and mitochondrial function, suggesting that 14-3-3ζ is a critical isoform in β-cells that regulates GSIS.

In addition, we document the presence of intratumoral synapses between GB cells, and the functional contribution of pre-synaptic genes to GB calcium dependent activity and expansion. Finally, we explore the relevance of synaptic genes in GB cells to the lifespan reduction caused by GB advance. Our results indicate that both presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins play a role in GB progression and lethality.</p>",2021-10-16

Peelle'}]","<p>Cochlear implants are neuroprosthetic devices that can restore hearing in individuals with severe to profound hearing loss by electrically stimulating the auditory nerve. Because of physical limitations on the precision of this stimulation, the acoustic information delivered by a cochlear implant does not convey the same level of spectral detail as that conveyed by normal hearing. As a result, speech understanding in listeners with cochlear implants is typically poorer and more effortful than in listeners with normal hearing. The brain networks supporting speech understanding in listeners with cochlear implants are not well understood, partly due to difficulties obtaining functional neuroimaging data in this population. In the current study, we assessed the brain regions supporting spoken word understanding in adult listeners with right unilateral cochlear implants (n=20) and matched controls (n=18) using high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), a quiet and non-invasive imaging modality with spatial resolution comparable to that of functional MRI. We found that while listening to spoken words in quiet, listeners with cochlear implants showed greater activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, overlapping with functionally-defined domain-general processing seen in a spatial working memory task. These results suggest that listeners with cochlear implants require greater cognitive processing during speech understanding than listeners with normal hearing, supported by compensatory recruitment in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</p>",2021-10-16

Previous studies have shown that tree cover shows bimodal distributions for intermediate rainfall regimes in Africa and South America. In this study, we construct a vegetation state diagram by plotting vegetation cover as a function of mean annual rainfall for Northeast India, which is part of the Eastern Himalaya and the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot. We use remotely sensed satellite data of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as a proxy for vegetation cover.

RIG-I agonists elicit a strong immune activation in both tumor and immune cells and induce both direct and indirect immune cell-mediated tumor cell death which involves tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cell response and type I interferon-driven innate cytotoxic immunity. Besides RIG-I, irradiation is known to induce cytotoxic DNA damage resulting in tumor debulking followed by the induction of tumor-specific immunity. To date, it is unclear whether the molecular antitumor effects of RIG-I and irradiation are additive or even synergize. Here, we investigated the combination of RIG-I activation with radiotherapy in melanoma. We found that low dose x-ray irradiation enhanced the extent and immunogenicity of RIG-I mediated tumor cell death in human and murine melanoma cell lines and in the murine B16 melanoma model in vivo. Pathway analysis of transcriptomic data revealed a central role for p53 downstream of the combined treatment, which was corroborated using p53-/- B16 cells. In vivo, the additional effect of irradiation on immune cell activation and inhibition of tumor growth was lost in mice carrying p53-knockout B16 tumors, while the response to RIG-I stimulation in those mice was maintained. Thus, our results identify p53 as pivotal for the synergy of RIG-I with irradiation, resulting in potent induction of immunogenic tumor cell death. Consequently, low dose radiotherapy holds great promise to further improve the efficacy or RIG-I ligands especially in patients with malignant melanoma or other tumors exhibiting a functional p53 pathway.</p>",2021-10-16

The animals were divided into Experimental control(EC) and Cyperus rotundus (CRR) treated groups. A change in tail volume around the wound was monitored for up to 20 days. The kinetics of the swelling was calculated for statistical significance. Further TS of the upper part of the wound was stained with H&amp;E stain and documented for histological changes.RESULTS: In the EC group, a gradual rise in swelling was recorded, which peaked on the 10th day and continued up to the 15th day, followed by a gradual decrease. In CR extract-treated group, the swelling was significantly low and the peak was obtained on the 8th day, while in the EC group the swelling was significantly higher and the peak was obtained 11th day. The histological section show, fibrous band intersection the lobules of adipocyte and lymphatic vascular channel and muscles in the sub epithelium region in the EC group, which was very less in CRR group.</p>",2021-10-16

To investigate the extent to which regulatory variants active in PPC contribute to pancreatic complex traits and disease in the adult, we derived PPC from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of nine unrelated individuals and generated single cell profiles of chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq) and transcriptome (scRNA-seq). While iPSC-PPC differentiation was asynchronous and included cell types from early to late developmental stages, we found that the predominant cell type consisted of NKX6-1+ progenitors. Genetic characterization using snATAC-seq identified 86,261 regulatory variants that either displayed chromatin allelic bias and/or were predicted to affect active transcription factor (TF) binding sites. Integration of these regulatory variants with 380 fine-mapped type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk loci identified regulatory variants in 209 of these loci that are functional in iPSC-PPC, either by affecting transcription factor binding or through association with allelic effects on chromatin accessibility. The PPC active regulatory variants in 65 of these loci showed strong evidence of causally underlying the association with T2D.

We established that the mechanistic basis for this improvement arises from reduced non-productive binding of supercharged Cel5A mutants to cell wall components such as crystalline cellulose (up to 1.7-fold) and lignin (up to 1.8-fold). Interestingly, supercharged Cel5A mutants that showed improved activity on various forms of pretreated corn stover showed increased reversible binding to lignin (up to 2.2-fold) while showing no change in overall thermal stability remarkably. In general, negative supercharging led to increased hydrolytic activity towards both pretreated lignocellulosic biomass and crystalline cellulose whereas positive supercharging led to a reduction of hydrolytic activity.

Design: Cross-sectional survey informed by the Framework for Culturally Competent Health Research conducted between March and July, 2021.

Setting: Participants were recruited from Greater Western Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

Participants: 708 community members who speak a language other than English at home participated (mean age: 45.4years [range 18 to 91]; 88% [n=622] born outside of Australia).

Outcome measures: Fifteen items regarding impacts of COVID-19, adapted from validated scales, previous surveys or co-designed in partnership with Multicultural Health and interpreter service staff. Logistic regression models (using post-stratification weighted frequencies) identified factors associated with psychological, social, and financial impacts. Surveys were available in English or translated (11 languages). 

Results: Even prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in Sydney, 25% of the sample reported feeling nervous or stressed most/all of the time and 22% felt lonely or alone most/all of the time. One quarter of participants reported negative impacts on their spousal relationships as a result of COVID-19 and most parents reported that their children were less active (64%), had more screen time (63%), and were finding school harder (45%).

CK2-mediated phosphorylation of a C-terminal region of IncV enables IncV hyperphosphorylation of a phospho-FFAT motif core and serine-rich tracts immediately upstream of IncV FFAT motif cores. Phosphorylatable serine tracts, rather than genetically-encoded acidic tracts, accommodate Type III-mediated translocation of IncV to the inclusion membrane, while achieving full mimicry of FFAT motifs.

This revealed that CREs vary substantially in their promoter compatibility, ranging from striking specificity for a single promoter to quantitative differences in activation across a broad set of promoters. More than half of the tested CREs exhibit significant promoter selectivity. Housekeeping promoters tend to have similar CRE preferences, but other promoters exhibit a wide diversity of compatibilities. Higher-order TF motif combinations may account for compatibility.

CRISPR-mediated genome editing has shown promising potentials for genetic improvements of plants. Generation of biallelic/homozygous mutants remains difficult for sweet orange due to low transformation rate, existence of heterozygous alleles for target genes and low biallelic editing efficacy using the CRISPR technology. Here, we report improvements in the CRISPR/Cas9 system for citrus gene editing. Based on the improvements we made previously (dicot codon optimized Cas9, tRNA for multiplexing, a modified sgRNA scaffold with high efficiency, CsU6 to drive sgRNA expression), we further improved our CRISPR/Cas9 system by choosing superior promoters (CmYLCV or CsUbi promoter) to drive Cas9 and optimizing culture temperature. This system was able to generate a biallelic mutation rate of up to 89% for Carrizo citrange and 79% for Hamlin sweet orange. Consequently, this system was used to generate canker resistant Hamlin sweet orange by mutating the effector binding element (EBE) of canker susceptibility gene CsLOB1, which is required for causing canker symptoms by Xcc. Six biallelic Hamlin sweet orange mutant lines in the EBE were generated. The biallelic mutants are resistant to Xcc. Biallelic mutation of the EBE region abolishes the induction of CsLOB1 by Xcc.
