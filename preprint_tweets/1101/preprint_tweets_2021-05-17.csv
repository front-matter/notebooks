Immune system dysregulation with a hyperinflammatory state, direct viral toxicity, endothelial damage and microvascular injury have been proposed as pathologenic mechanisms. Recently, cohorts of children with PASC have been reported in Italy, Sweden and Russia. However, immunological studies of children with PASC have never been performed.</p><p>In this study, we documented significant immunologic differences between children that completely recovered from acute infection and those with PASC, providing the first objective laboratory sign of the existence of PASC in children.</p>",2021-05-10

We tested various clades such as 19A (initial one), 20B (B.1.1.241 lineage), 20I/501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7 lineage), and 20H/501Y.V2 (B.1.351 lineage).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No significant difference was observed between the 20B and 19A isolates for HCWs with mild COVID-19 and critical patients. However, a significant decrease in neutralisation ability was found for 20I/501Y.V1 in comparison with 19A isolate for critical patients and HCWs 6-months post infection. Concerning 20H/501Y.V2, all populations had a significant reduction in neutralising antibody titres in comparison with the 19A isolate. Interestingly, a significant difference in neutralisation capacity was observed for vaccinated HCWs between the two variants whereas it was not significant for the convalescent groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Neutralisation capacity was slightly reduced for critical patients and HCWs 6-months post infection. No neutralisation escape could be feared concerning the two variants of concern in both populations. The reduced neutralising response observed towards the 20H/501Y.V2 in comparison with the 19A and 20I/501Y.V1 isolates in fully immunized subjects with the BNT162b2 vaccine is a striking finding of the study.</p></sec>",2021-05-11

We show that the epidemics in most countries were initiated by importations, predominantly from Europe, which diminished following the early introduction of international travel restrictions. As the pandemic progressed, ongoing transmission in many countries and increasing mobility led to the emergence and spread within the continent of many variants of concern and interest, such as B.1.351, B.1.525, A.23.1 and C.1.1.

Numerous brain parcellations have been proposed, using cytoarchitectonic data, structural or functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The intrinsic smoothness of the brain data, however, poses a problem for current methods seeking to compare different parcellations to each other. For example, criteria that simply compare within-parcel to between-parcel similarity provide even random parcellations with a high value. Furthermore, the evaluation is biased by the spatial scale of the parcellation. To address this problem, we propose the Distance Controlled Boundary Coefficient (DCBC), an unbiased criterion to evaluate discrete parcellations. We employ this new criterion to evaluate whether existing parcellations of the human neocortex can predict functional boundaries on a rich multi-domain task battery. We find that common anatomical parcellations do not perform better than chance, suggesting that task-based functional boundaries do not align well with sulcal landmarks. Parcellations based on resting-state fMRI data perform well; in some cases, as well as a parcellation defined on the evaluation data itself. Finally, multi-modal parcellations that combine functional and anatomical criteria perform substantially worse than those based on functional data alone, indicating that functionally homogeneous regions often span major anatomical landmarks. Overall, the DCBC advances the field of functional brain mapping by providing an unbiased metric that compares the predictive ability of different brain parcellations to define functionally and anatomically homogeneous brain regions.</p>",2021-05-11

Advances in spatial transcriptomics open the way for studying these important determinants of cellular function by enabling a transcriptome-wide evaluation of gene expression <italic>in situ</italic>. A critical limitation of the current technologies, however, is that their resolution is limited to niches (spots) of sizes well beyond that of a single cell, thus providing measurements for cell aggregates which may mask critical interactions between neighboring cells of different types. While joint analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be leveraged to alleviate this problem, current analyses are limited to a discrete view of cell type proportion inside every spot. This limitation becomes critical in the common case where, even within a cell type, there is a continuum of cell states that cannot be clearly demarcated but reflects important differences in the way cells function and interact with their surroundings. To address this, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI), a probabilistic method for multi-resolution analysis for spatial transcriptomics that explicitly models continuous variation within cell types. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI is capable of providing higher resolution compared to the existing methods and that it can estimate gene expression by every cell type inside every spot. We then introduce an automated pipeline that uses DestVI for analysis of single tissue slices and comparison between tissues. We apply this pipeline to study the immune crosstalk within lymph nodes to infection and explore the spatial organization of a mouse tumor model. In both cases, we demonstrate that DestVI can provide a high resolution and accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues, and that it is capable of identifying important cell-type-specific changes in gene expression - between different tissue regions or between conditions.

Here, we propose a natural-language-processing-based machine learning approach (NLP-ML) to infer tissue and cell-type annotations for –omics samples based only on their free-text metadata. NLP-ML works by creating numerical representations of sample text descriptions and using these representations as features in a supervised learning classifier that predicts tissue/cell-type terms in a structured ontology. Our approach significantly and substantially outperforms an advanced text annotation method (MetaSRA) that uses graph-based reasoning and a baseline method (TAGGER) that annotates text based on exact string matching. Model similarities between related tissues demonstrate that NLP-ML models capture biologically-meaningful signals in text, as does the ability of these models to classify tissue-associated biological processes and diseases based on their descriptions alone. NLP-ML models are nearly as accurate as models based on gene-expression profiles in predicting sample tissue annotations but have the distinct capability to classify samples irrespective of the –omics experiment type based on their text metadata.

Genomic surveillance of cases from Dane County, where UW-Madison is located, did not find evidence of transmission from a large cluster of cases in the two residence halls quarantined during the outbreak.

Therefore, we sought to generate a collection of experimentally validated TSSs by integrating <italic>RNA Annotation and Mapping of Promoters for the Analysis of Gene Expression</italic> (RAMPAGE) data from 115 cell and tissue types, which resulted in a collection of approximately 50 thousand representative RAMPAGE peaks. These peaks were primarily proximal to GENCODE-annotated TSSs and were concordant with other transcription assays. Because RAMPAGE uses paired-end reads, we were then able to connect peaks to transcripts by analyzing the genomic positions of the 3’ ends of read mates. Using this paired-end information, we classified the vast majority (37 thousand) of our RAMPAGE peaks as verified TSSs, updating TSS annotations for 20% of GENCODE genes. We also found that these updated TSS annotations were supported by epigenomic and other transcriptomic datasets. To demonstrate the utility of this RAMPAGE rPeak collection, we intersected it with the NHGRI/EBI GWAS catalog and identified new candidate GWAS genes.

Through our analysis, we identify several weaknesses in each of the three pillars of the TTI strategy: testing, tracing and isolating. Moreover, we analyse the respondents’ self-reported behaviour before and after the mitigation strategies were deployed during the second wave of infections. We find that the changes in the participants’ behaviour were more pronounced in Italy than in Spain, whereas in both countries, respondents reported being very compliant with individual protection measures, such as wearing facial masks or frequently disinfecting their hands. Finally, we analyse the participants’ perceptions about their government’s measures and the safety of everyday activities and places regarding the risk of getting an infection. We find that the perceived risk is often gender- and age-dependent and not aligned with the risk level identified by the literature.

By combining DNA methylation arrays and gene expression data with TF binding sites (TFBSs), we explored the interplay between TF binding and DNA methylation in 19 cancer cohorts. We performed emQTL (expression-methylation quantitative trait loci) analyses in each cohort and identified 13 TFs whose expression levels are correlated with local DNA methylation patterns around their binding site in at least 2 cancer types. The 13 TFs are mainly associated with local demethylation and are enriched for pioneer function, suggesting a specific role for these TFs in modulating chromatin structure and transcription in cancer patients.

Using a novel quantitative pipeline, a panel of 73 diagnostic SNPs was developed for the three lineages, evaluated for accuracy, and then used to screen 881 samples from 52 sites for genetic integrity and hybridization on the Agena MassARRAY platform. These results strongly support a redrawing of native ranges for both the intergrade zone and <italic>M. floridanus</italic>, which has significant implications for current fisheries management. Furthermore, Delta bass ancestry was shown to contribute significantly to the previously described intergrade zone between northern Largemouth Bass and Florida Bass, suggesting a more complex pattern of secondary contact and introgression among these diverged <italic>Micropterus</italic> lineages.</p>",2021-05-13

Bacteria produce a complex cell envelope and possess drug-export efflux pumps to limit drug accumulation inside cells. Decreasing cell envelope permeability and increasing efflux pump activity can reduce intracellular accumulation of antibiotics, and are commonly seen in antibiotic resistant strains. Here, we show that the balance between influx and efflux differs depending on bacterial growth phase in Gramnegative bacteria. Accumulation of the model fluorescent drug, ethidium bromide (EtBr) was measured in <italic>S</italic>.

EtBr accumulation in Δ<italic>acrB</italic> was high in exponential phase but dropped sharply later in growth, with no significant difference to SL1344 in stationary phase. Low EtBr accumulation in stationary phase was not due to the upregulation of other efflux pumps, but instead, due to decreased permeability of the envelope in stationary phase. RNAseq identified changes in expression of several pathways that remodel the envelope in stationary phase, leading to lower permeability. This study shows that efflux is only important for maintaining low drug accumulation in actively growing cells, and that envelope permeability is the predominant factor dictating the rate of drug entry in stationary phase cells. This conclusion means that (i) antibiotics with intracellular targets may be less effective in complex non-growing or slow-growing bacterial infections where intracellular accumulation may be low, (ii) efflux inhibitors may be successful in potentiating the activity of existing antibiotics, but potentially only for bacterial infections where cells are actively growing and (iii) the remodelling of the cell envelope prior to stationary phase could provide novel drug targets.</p>",2021-05-11

This process involves perforin-dependent elimination of activated CD4 T cells during the first three days of infection. Although this mechanism requires cell-cell contact, NK cells and T cells typically reside in different compartments of lymphoid tissues at steady state. Here, we show that NK-cell suppression of T cells is associated with a transient accumulation of NK cells within T cell-rich sites of the spleen during lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is required for relocation to T-cell zones and suppression of antiviral T cells. Accordingly, this NK-cell migration is mediated by type I interferon (IFN)-dependent promotion of CXCR3 ligand expression. In contrast, adenoviral vectors that weakly induce type I IFN and do not stimulate NK-cell inhibition of T cells also do not promote measurable redistribution of NK cells to T-cell zones. Provision of supplemental IFN could rescue NK-cell migration during adenoviral vector immunization. Thus, type I IFN and CXCR3 are critical for properly positioning NK cells to constrain antiviral T-cell responses. Development of strategies to curtail migration of NK cells between lymphoid compartments may enhance vaccine-elicited immune responses.</p>",2021-05-11

Incorporation of NHC monophosphate into nascent RNA does not impair further RdRp progression. When the RdRp uses the resulting RNA as a template, NHC directs incorporation of either G or A, leading to mutated RNA products. Structural analysis of RdRp-RNA complexes containing mutagenesis products shows that NHC can form stable base pairs with either G or A in the RdRp active center, explaining how the polymerase escapes proofreading and synthesizes mutated RNA.

In maize, the presence of specialized aerial brace roots has been shown to increase anchorage and root lodging resistance. However, beyond scoring for presence, there have been limited attempts to define the brace root phenotypes that optimize anchorage. This study reports variable root lodging and plant biomechanics in a population of 52 maize inbred lines. To quantify the variation in brace root phenotypes within this population, a semi-automated phenotyping workflow was developed. These empirical measurements were integrated into predictive random forest models to demonstrate that brace root phenotypes can classify root lodging incidence and plant biomechanics. The prediction accuracy of these models is driven by multiple brace root phenotypes suggesting that anchorage can be optimized by the manipulation of multiple functional traits. Plant height has been previously associated with lodging susceptibility yet the inclusion of plant height as a predictor does not always improve prediction accuracy. Previously, brace root node number has been shown to be genetically linked to plant height and here we show that additional brace root phenotypes are linked to plant height but with opposing effects on root lodging susceptibility. Together these data define the important brace root phenotypes that predict root lodging resistance and demonstrate the need to uncouple the linkage between plant height and root traits for the development of climate resilient crops.</p>",2021-05-13

Preventable deaths were calculated assuming a 72% vaccine efficacy over an 8-month period. Finally, benefit-risk ratio of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination was calculated as the ratio between preventable COVID-19 deaths and vaccine-related deaths, using Monte-Carlo simulations. We found that among subjects aged 20-29 years the benefit-risk [B-R] ratio was not clearly favorable (0.70; 95% Uncertainty Interval [UI]: 0.27-2.11).

However, this method has limitations in terms of clone number selection and modeling. We propose SigTracer, a novel hierarchical Bayesian approach for analyzing intra-tumor heterogeneity based on mutation signatures to tackle these issues. We show that SigTracer predicts more reasonable clone decompositions than the existing methods that use artificial data that mimic cancer genomes. We applied SigTracer to whole-genome sequences of blood cancer samples. The results were consistent with past findings that single base substitutions caused by a specific signature (previously reported as SBS9) related to the activation-induced cytidine deaminase intensively lie within immunoglobulin-coding regions for chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples.

Individuals post-CAR-T-cell therapy were in remission. We tested for antibodies to 4 vaccine strains at baseline and ≥1 time point after IIV using neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition assays. An antibody response was defined as a ≥4-fold titer increase from baseline at the first post-vaccine time point. Baseline A(H1N1) titers in the CAR-T cohorts were significantly lower compared to controls. Antibody responses to ≥1 vaccine strain occurred in 2 (29%) individuals before CAR-T-cell therapy; one individual maintained a response for &gt;3 months post-CAR-T-cell therapy. Antibody responses to ≥1 vaccine strain occurred in 6 (40%) individuals vaccinated after CAR-T-cell therapy.

There were no identified clinical or immunologic predictors of antibody responses. Neither severe hypogammaglobulinemia nor B-cell aplasia precluded antibody responses. These data support consideration for vaccination before and after CAR-T-cell therapy for influenza and other relevant pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, irrespective of hypogammaglobulinemia or B-cell aplasia.

Here, we present a Bayesian method to infer kinetic parameters of oscillatory gene expression regulation using an auto-negative feedback motif with delay. Specifically, we use a delay-adapted nonlinear Kalman filter within a Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm to identify posterior probability distributions. Our method can be applied to time series data on gene expression from single cells and is able to infer multiple parameters simultaneously. We apply it to published data on murine neural progenitor cells and show that it outperforms alternative methods.

CG are essential for normal neurogenesis and build a reticular network spanning the entire central nervous system while encasing each NSC linage. We first show that individual CG cells grow tremendously to enwrap several NSC linages, ultimately covering and tiling the entire tissue. Several proliferative mechanisms, including endoreplication and mitosis, in part acytokinetic, support such growth and result in the formation of multinucleated, syncytial CG cells, that we call units. We then reveal that CG units are able to fuse to each other, resulting in the exchange of several subcellular compartments, such as membrane, cytoplasm and organelles. This process relies on well-known molecular players of cell fusion, involving cell surface communication molecules and actin regulators, while being atypical by its extent, dynamics and partial nature.

Nevertheless, previous analyses have shown that methods that depend on only sequence or structural information may have limited accuracy. Recently, researchers have attempted to increase the accuracy of their predictions by incorporating protein dynamics into pathogenicity predictions. This study presents &lt; Lai Yang Rubenstein Uzun Sarkar &gt; (LYRUS), a machine learning method that uses an XGBoost classifier selected by TPOT to predict the pathogenicity of SAVs. LYRUS incorporates five sequence-based features, six structure-based features, and four dynamics-based features. Uniquely, LYRUS includes a newly-proposed sequence co-evolution feature called variation number. LYRUS’s performance was evaluated using a dataset that contains 4,363 protein structures corresponding to 20,307 SAVs based on human genetic variant data from the ClinVar database.

Therefore, we hypothesized that a direct unbiased total nucleic acid extraction method could overcome the cumbersome protocols, variability and low recovery rates associated with the former methods. This led to development of a simple, rapid, and modular alternative to existing purification methods. In an initial concentration step, chaotropic agents are added to raw sewage allowing binding of nucleic acid from free nucleoprotein complexes, partially intact, and intact virions to a silica matrix.

Unlike other cAMP effectors, such as PKA and EPAC, POPDC1 is membrane-bound and the sequence of the cAMP-binding cassette differs from canonical cAMP-binding domains.

Slave-maker ants are social parasites that exploit the work force of closely related ant species for social behaviours such as brood care and foraging. Recent divergence between these social parasites and their hosts enables comparative studies of gene family evolution. We sequenced the genomes of eight ant species, representing three independent origins of ant slavery. During the evolution of eusociality, chemoreceptor genes multiplied due to the importance of chemical communication in societies. We investigated evolutionary patterns of chemoreceptors in relation to slave-making in ants. We found that slave-maker ant genomes harboured only half as many gustatory receptors as their hosts, potentially mirroring the outsourcing of foraging tasks to host workers. In addition, parasites had fewer odorant receptors and their loss shows patterns of convergence across origins of parasitism, representing a rare case of convergent molecular evolution. This convergent loss of specific odorant receptors suggests that selective deprivation of receptors is adaptive. The 9-exon odorant receptor subfamily, previously linked to social evolution in insects, was significantly enriched for convergent loss across the three origins of slavery in our study, indicating that the transition to social parasitism in ants is accompanied by the loss of receptors that are likely important for mediating eusocial behaviour. Overall, gene loss in slave-maker ants suggests that a switch to a parasitic lifestyle accompanies relaxed selection on chemical perception.</p>",2021-05-11

Differentiation to hematopoietic progenitor cells was associated with the formation of tissue-specific sub-TADs over Runx1, a shift in E-P interactions, P1 promoter demethylation, and robust expression from both Runx1 promoters. Deletions of promoter-proximal CTCF sites at the sub-TAD boundaries had no obvious effects on E-P interactions but led to partial loss of domain structure, mildly affected gene expression, and delayed hematopoietic development.

Enrichment analysis of gene ontology (GO) terms built a tissue-specific map of the chronological order of altered biological processes across healthy controls (CTRL), pre-diabetes (PD) and T2D subjects.

Importantly, we found widespread novel alterations in relevant biological pathways including the increase in hemostasis in pancreatic islets of PD, the increase in the complement cascade in liver and pancreatic islets of PD and the elevation in cholesterol biosynthesis in liver of T2D. Overall, our findings suggest inflammatory, immune and vascular impairments in pancreatic islets as potentially causal factors of insufficient insulin production and increased glucagon levels in the early stages of T2D.

These findings were subsequently validated in another public transcriptomic cohort as well as a recruited cohort. ACE2 was lowly expressed in most cancers compared with adjacent tissues. ACE2 was positively correlated with immunomodulators, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs), cancer immunity cycles, immune checkpoints, and tumor mutation burden (TMB). Besides, high ACE2 levels indicated the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype of BRCA, lower response to endocrine therapy and higher response to chemotherapy, anti-ERBB therapy, antiangiogenic therapy and immunotherapy.

Due to their transcriptomic nature, we can use these models to directly infer mechanisms of aging from their features. Linear regression remains the current standard analysis technique, but we improved upon its baseline performance with modern techniques, exploring both XGBoost and MLPs. We also experimented with using deconvolved cell data for predictions, which account for cellular composition and reduce signal distortion from rare cell types.

Given the small size of our datasets, we were unable to make conclusive determinations about multi-tissue predictors, but preliminary results suggest that the technique shows promise and is worthy of future investigation. Likewise, given our limited deconvolved cell data, we did not currently observe strong results, but we again note that this is an area in need of further investigation.</p><p>By improving upon the performance of existing models, we demonstrated that a novel machine learning technique, XGBoost, can be an effective technique to further our understanding of aging mechanisms by extraction of the most relevant genes found in those models.

The extent to which viral shedding and transmission occurs on re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 after prior natural exposure or vaccination is an emerging area of understanding. We used Sialodacryoadenitis Virus (SDAV) in rats to model the extent to which immune protection afforded by prior natural infection via high risk (inoculation; direct contact) or low risk (fomite) exposure, or by vaccination, influenced viral shedding and transmission on re-exposure. On initial infection, we confirmed that amount, duration and consistency of viral shedding were correlated with exposure risk. Animals were reinfected after 3.7-5.5 months using the same exposure paradigm. Amount and duration of viral shedding were correlated with re-exposure type and serologic status. 59% of seropositive animals shed virus. Previously exposed seropositive reinfected animals were able to transmit virus to 25% of naive recipient rats after 24-hour exposure by direct contact. Rats vaccinated intranasally with a related virus (Parkers Rat Coronavirus) were able to transmit SDAV to only 4.7% of naive animals after a 7-day direct contact exposure, despite comparable viral shedding. Observed cycle threshold values associated with transmission in both groups ranged from 29-36 cycles, however observed shedding was not a prerequisite for transmission. Results indicate that low-level shedding in both naturally infected and vaccinated seropositive animals can propagate infection in susceptible individuals. Extrapolated to COVID-19, our results suggest that continued propagation of SARS-CoV-2 by seropositive previously infected or vaccinated individuals is possible.</p>",2021-05-11

To test this prediction, we studied human patients with focal thalamic lesions in conjunction with network analyses of the human thalamocortical functional connectome. In support of our prediction, lesions to thalamic subregions with stronger hub properties were associated with widespread deficits in executive, language, and memory functions, whereas lesions to thalamic subregions with weaker hub properties were associated with more limited deficits.

simulations of conformational transitions in biopolymers. While there is great variation in terms of implementation, a well-defined 
workflow involving multiple steps is often adopted. Typically, molecular coordinates are first subjected to dimensionality reduction and then clustered into small ``microstates'', which are subsequently lumped into ``macrostates'' using the information from the slowest eigenmodes. However, the microstate dynamics is often non-Markovian and long lag times are required to converge the MSM. Here we propose a variation on this typical workflow, taking advantage of hierarchical density-based clustering. When applied to simulation data, this type of clustering separates high population regions of conformational space from others that are rarely visited. In this way, density-based clustering naturally implements assignment of the data based on transitions between metastable states. As a result, the state definition becomes more consistent with the assumption of Markovianity and the timescales of the slow dynamics of the system are recovered more effectively. We present results of this simplified workflow for a model potential and MD simulations of the alanine dipeptide and the FiP35 WW domain.</p>",2021-05-16

The complexity of interspecies interactions, which are key for the macroscopic behavior of microbial communities, cannot be studied easily experimentally. For this reason, the modeling of microbial communities has begun to leverage the knowledge of established constraint-based methods, which have long been used for studying and analyzing the microbial metabolism of individual species based on genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of microorganisms. A main problem of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions is that they usually contain metabolic gaps due to genome misannotations and unknown enzyme functions. This problem is traditionally solved by using gap-filling algorithms that add biochemical reactions from external databases to the metabolic reconstruction, in order to restore model growth. However, gap-filling algorithms could evolve by taking into account metabolic interactions among species that coexist in microbial communities. In this work, a gap-filling method that resolves metabolic gaps at the community level was developed. The efficacy of the algorithm was tested by analyzing its ability to resolve metabolic gaps on a synthetic community of auxotrophic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains.

Costs of off-target effects are minimized for a construct with Cas9HF1, a high-fidelity version of Cas9.

We used single nuclear RNA-Seq (snRNA-Seq) profiling of treated OFs to compare gene expression over time in order to identify pathways that are involved in orbital adipogenesis in vitro and compared the dynamic patterns of gene expression identify differences in gene expression in control and TAO orbital fat.

Results:
Orbital fat from TAO and control patients segregate with principal component analysis (PCA). Numerous signaling pathways are enriched in orbital fat isolated from TAO patients.  SnRNA-Seq of orbital fibroblasts undergoing adipogenesis reveals differential expression of adipocyte-specific genes over the developmental time course. Furthermore, genes that are enriched in TAO orbital fat are also upregulated in orbital adipocytes that differentiate in vitro, while genes that are enriched in control orbital fat are enriched in orbital fibroblasts prior to differentiation.

Conclusions:
Differentiating orbital fibroblasts serve as a model to study orbital fat hyperplasia seen in TAO. We demonstrate that the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and Wnt signaling pathways are differentially expressed early in orbital adipogenesis.</p>",2021-05-15

Although RNA sequencing has contributed to the understanding of brain endothelial cell diversity, bulk analysis and single-cell approaches have relied on fresh tissue digestion protocols for the isolation of single endothelial cells and flow cytometry-based sorting on surface markers or transgene expression. These approaches are limited in the analysis of the endothelium in human brain tissues, where fresh samples are difficult to obtain. Here, we developed an approach to examine endothelial RNA expression by using an endothelial-specific marker to isolate nuclei from abundant archived frozen brain tissues. We show that this approach rapidly and reliably extracts endothelial nuclei from frozen mouse brain samples, and importantly, from archived frozen human brain tissues. Furthermore, isolated RNA transcript levels are closely correlated with expression in whole cells from tissue digestion protocols and are enriched in endothelial markers and depleted of markers of other brain cell types. As high-quality RNA transcripts could be obtained from as few as 100 nuclei in archived frozen human brain tissues, we predict that this approach should be useful for both bulk analysis of endothelial RNA transcripts in human brain tissues as well as single-cell analysis of endothelial sub-populations.</p>",2021-05-13

The potential for vaccine-escape mutations poses additional challenges in pandemic control. Despite being of great interest to therapeutic and vaccine development, human-adaptive mutations in SARS-CoV-2 are masked by a genome-wide linkage disequilibrium under which neutral and even deleterious mutations can reach fixation by chance or through hitchhiking. Furthermore, genome-wide linkage equilibrium imposes clonal interference by which multiple adaptive mutations compete against one another. Informed by insights from microbial experimental evolution, we analyzed close to one million SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and identified putative human-adaptive mutations according to the rates of synonymous and missense mutations, temporal linkage, and mutation recurrence. Furthermore, we developed a forward-evolution simulator with the realistic SARS-CoV-2 genome structure and base substitution probabilities able to predict viral genome diversity under neutral, background selection, and adaptive evolutionary models.

Although the findings on the effectiveness of CGRP-targeted therapies in migraine provide new information about the pathophysiology of migraine, questions remain on how the CGRP mechanisms fit into the overall migraine theory. The cryo-EM structure of Gs-protein complexed human CGRP receptor (CGRPR) with bound endogenous CGRP neuropeptide paved the way of understanding the insights into the CGRP receptor function. With several molecular modeling approaches, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and post-MD analyzes, we aimed to investigate the importance of RAMP1 in the stability of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR). Moreover, we compared the binding modes of the CGRP neuropeptide and CGRPR antagonists (i.e., telcagepant and rimegepant) within the presence or absence of RAMP1. We also investigated the global and local effects of bound molecules on CGRPR as well as their effects on the CLR-RAMP1 interaction interfaces. Results showed that although these molecules stay stable at the ectodomain binding site, they can also bind to the orthosteric ligand binding pocket and form the crucial interactions occurred in the CGRP agonism, which may be interpreted as non-specificity of the ligands, however, most of these interactions at orthosteric site are not sustainable or weak. Particularly, RAMP1 may also be important for the stability of TM domain of CLR hereby stabilizing the orthosteric binding pocket.</p>",2021-05-10

Schaefer'}, {'name': 'Hendrik Jung'}, {'name': 'Gerhard Hummer'}]","<p>During infection the SARS-CoV-2 virus fuses its viral envelope with cellular membranes of its human host. Initial contact with the host cell and membrane fusion are both mediated by the viral spike (S) protein. Proteolytic cleavage of S at the S2′ site exposes its 40 amino acid long fusion peptide (FP). Binding of the FP to the host membrane anchors the S2 domain of S in both the viral and the host membrane. The reorganization of S2 then pulls the two membranes together. Here we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the two core functions of the SARS-CoV-2 FP: to attach quickly to cellular membranes and to form an anchor strong enough to withstand the mechanical force during membrane fusion. In eight 10 <italic>μ</italic>s-long MD simulations of FP in proximity to endosomal and plasma membranes, we find that FP binds spontaneously to the membranes and that binding proceeds predominantly by insertion of two short amphipathic helices into the membrane interface. Connected via a flexible linker, the two helices can bind the membrane independently, yet binding of one promotes the binding of the other by tethering it close to the target membrane. By simulating mechanical pulling forces acting on the C-terminus of the FP we then show that the bound FP can bear forces up to 250 pN before detaching from the membrane. This detachment force is more than ten-fold higher than an estimate of the force required to pull host and viral membranes together for fusion. We identify a fully conserved disulfide bridge in the FP as a major factor for the high mechanical stability of the FP membrane anchor. We conclude, first, that the sequential binding of two short amphipathic helices allows the SARS-CoV-2 FP to insert quickly into the target membrane, before the virion is swept away after shedding the S1 domain connecting it to the host cell receptor. Second, we conclude that the double attachment and the conserved disulfide bridge establish the strong anchoring required for subsequent membrane fusion. Multiple distinct membrane-anchoring elements ensure high avidity and high mechanical strength of FP-membrane binding.</p>",2021-05-10

However, RIF is completely ineffective against <italic>M. abscessus</italic> despite the absence of mutations in the rifampicin resistance determining region of <italic>Mab_rpoB</italic>. This has been attributed to the presence of an ADP-ribosyltransferase (Arr) activity that inactivates RIF. Rifabutin (RBT), a close analogue of RIF, has recently been shown to be effective against <italic>M. abscessus in vitro</italic> and in a mouse model and comprises a promising therapeutic against <italic>M. abscessus</italic> infections.

However, fresh residue inputs could also “prime” the decomposition of native SOM, resulting in accelerated SOM depletion and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Increasing the botanical diversity of the crops grown in arable systems has been promoted to increase the delivery of multiple ecological functions, including increasing soil microbial biomass and SOM. Whether mixtures of fresh residues from different crops grown in polyculture contribute to soil carbon (C) pools to a greater extent than would be expected from applying individual residues (i.e., the mixture produces a non-additive synergistic effect) has not been systematically tested and is currently unknown. In this study, we used <sup>13</sup>C isotope labelled cover crop residues (i.e., buckwheat, clover, radish, and sunflower) to track the fate of plant residue-derived C and C derived from the priming of SOM in treatments comprising a quaternary mixture of the residues and the average effect of the four individual residues one day after residue incorporation in a laboratory microcosm experiment. Our results indicate that, despite all treatments receiving the same amount of plant residue-derived C (1 mg<sup>-1</sup> C g soil), the total microbial biomass in the treatment receiving the residue mixture was significantly greater, by 26% (3.69 µg<sup>-1</sup> C g), than the average microbial biomass observed in treatments receiving the four individual components of the mixture one day after applying crop residues. The greater microbial biomass C in the quaternary mixture, compared to average of the individual residue treatments, that can be attributed directly to the plant residue applied was also significantly greater, by 132% (3.61 µg<sup>-1</sup> C g). However, there was no evidence that the mixture resulted in any more priming of native SOM than average priming observed in the individual residue treatments. The soil microbial community structure, assessed using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, was significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) different in the soil receiving the residue mixture, compared to the average structures of the communities in soil receiving four individual residues. Differences in the biomass of fungi, general bacteria, and Gram-positive bacteria were responsible for the observed synergistic effect of crop residue mixtures on total microbial biomass and residue-derived microbial biomass, especially biomarkers 16:0, 18:2ω6 and 18:3ω3. Our study demonstrates that applying a mixture of crop residues increases soil microbial biomass to a greater extent than would be expected from applying individual residues and that this occurs either due to faster decomposition of the crop residues or greater carbon use efficiency (CUE), rather than priming the decomposition of native SOM. Therefore, growing crop polycultures (e.g., cover crop mixtures) and incorporating mixtures of the resulting crop residues into the soil could be an effective method to increase microbial biomass and ultimately C stocks in arable soils.</p>",2021-05-11

Navigational cues orient individuals toward a destination, while it is hypothesised that communication between individuals enhances navigation through a reduction in orientation error. We develop a mathematical model of collective navigation that synthesises navigational cues and perception of other individuals. Crucially, this approach incorporates the uncertainty inherent to cue interpretation and perception in the decision making process, which can arise due to noisy environments. We demonstrate that collective navigation is more efficient than individual navigation, provided a threshold number of other individuals are perceptible. This benefit is even more pronounced in low navigation information environments. In navigation “blindspots”, where no information is available, navigation is enhanced through a relay that connects individuals in information-poor regions to individuals in information-rich regions.

COVID – 19 is found to bind with the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors for viral entry. ACE2 receptors are normally expressed in various body surfaces as well as in the neurons and glial cells where they act as an entry port to SARS-CoV-2 infection to invade the central nervous system (CNS). ACE2 are also highly expressed in dopamine neurons which might worsen the outcome in terms of motor symptoms in PD with the treatment course. It may lead to an indirect response via immune-mediated cytokine storms and propagate through CNS leading to damage. Parkinson’s disease has also been noticed due to certain post-viral infections apart from COVID-19 such as, HSV, Influenza virus A, Measles virus, Cytomegalovirus and Mumps (Olsen et al, 2018). We aim to provide a thorough review on neurological outcomes and impact of COVID-19 in Parkinson disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A systematic review was conducted to analyze the impact of COVID-19 in patients with Parkinson disease (&gt; 21 yo).

Due to the novelty of the virus, studies were reported from recent years and further extensive studies are needed to explore more about the disease severity and neurological outcomes when compared to other non-PD patients. Authors identify this as a limitation for this paper. Additional studies are needed to understand the role of ACE2 in increasing vulnerability to viruses and role of ACE inhibitors as treatment modality.</p></sec>",2021-05-12

Repeatedly sampling the same tumor increases the statistical power of differentially expressed gene analysis that is indispensable towards downstream analysis and also increases ones understanding of within-tumor variance that may affect conclusions.

These results demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence for prodromal α5GABA-A receptor dysfunction in the AD hippocampal trisynaptic circuit.

When repeatedly exposed to predictable prey, the predators adjusted their behaviour before the prey even began to escape: prey programmed to escape directly away were approached more rapidly than prey escaping at an acute angle. These faster approach speeds compensated for a longer time needed to capture such prey during the subsequent pursuit phase, and predators showed greater acceleration when pursuing unpredictable prey.

Our analyses using machine learning (i.e., KAML) and deep learning (i.e., DeepGP) together with the four common methods (PBLUP, GBLUP, ssGBLUP and BayesR) were conducted for two main disease resistance traits (i.e., survival status coded as 0 and 1 and survival time, i.e., days that the animals were still alive after the challenge test) in a pedigree consisting of 560 individual animals (490 offspring and 70 parents) genotyped for 14,154 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs). The results showed that KAML outperformed GBLUP and ssGBLUP, with the increases in the prediction accuracies for both traits by 5.1 – 47.7%. However, the prediction accuracies obtained from KAML were comparable to those estimated using BayesR. Imputation of missing genotypes using AlphaFamImpute increased the prediction accuracies by 0.2 – 33.2% in all the methods used. On the other hand, there were no significant increases in the prediction accuracies for both survival status and survival time when multivariate models were used in comparison to univariate analyses.

Fruiting body development in myxobacteria often unfolds within genetically and behaviorally diverse conspecific cellular environments that can include social defection and warfare.

Fruiting body morphology was found to diversify as a function of developmental partners, revealing adaptation specific to distinct cellular environments. Collectively, antagonistic partners selected for higher levels of robust fruiting body formation than did cheaters or the benign cooperator. Moreover, even small degrees of genetic divergence between the distinct cheater partners were sufficient to drive treatment-level morphological divergence. Co-developmental partners not only shaped mean trait evolution but also determined the magnitude and dynamics of stochastic morphological diversification and subsequent convergence.

                    <p>The priority groups together account for about 18% of India’s
                        population. An infection preventing vaccine with 60% efficacy covering all
                        these groups would reduce peak symptomatic incidence by 20.6% (95%
                        uncertainty intervals (CrI) 16.7 - 25.4), and cumulative mortality by 29.7%
                        (95% CrI 25.8-33.8). A similar vaccine with ability to prevent symptoms (but
                        not infection) will reduce peak incidence of symptomatic cases by 10.4% (95%
                        CrI 8.4 – 13.0), and cumulative mortality by 32.9% (95% CrI 28.6 - 37.3). In
                        the event of insufficient vaccine supply to cover all priority groups, model
                        projections suggest that after keyworkers, vaccine strategy should

Chilling units, growth regulators, and nutrient supply are considered inducers of ED release, but the mechanism governing ED duration is poorly understood. The potato tuber has been used as a model system to study metabolic processes associated with ED release. Cold-induced sweetening is a well-known response of the tuber to chilling. Here, we found that cold stress induces an increase in sugar units in association with plasmodesmatal closure in the dormant bud cells. Tuber sweetening was associated with shortened ED duration after cooling. Heat exposure also caused sugar unit accumulation followed by faster ED release. A logistic function was developed to predict ED duration based on sugar unit measurements. We discovered that ED release is better correlated with the accumulation of sugar units compared to chilling units. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of the vacuolar invertase gene (<italic>StVInv</italic>) induced longer ED, but only in cultivars in which the mutation modified the level sugar units. Our results suggest that sugar units are better predictors of vegetative bud ED duration than chilling units.</p>",2021-05-10

We investigated the clinical characteristics and potential aetiological agents of unexplained encephalitis through metagenomic next-generation sequencing of residual clinical samples of multiple tissue types and independent clinical review. A total of 43 specimens, from both sterile and non-sterile sites, were collected from 18 encephalitis cases with no cause identified by the Australian Childhood Encephalitis study. Samples were subjected to total RNA sequencing to determine the presence and abundance of potential pathogens, to reveal mixed infections, pathogen genotypes, and epidemiological origins, and to describe the possible aetiologies of unexplained encephalitis. From this, we identified five RNA and two DNA viruses associated with human infection from both non-sterile (nasopharyngeal aspirates, nose/throat swabs, urine, stool rectal swab) and sterile (cerebrospinal fluid, blood) sites. These comprised two human rhinoviruses, two human seasonal coronaviruses, two polyomaviruses and one picobirnavirus. With the exception of picobirnavirus all have been previously associated with respiratory disease. Human rhinovirus and seasonal coronaviruses may be responsible for five of the encephalitis cases reported here.

We have previously identified two populations of Purkinje cells that participate in this computation: Tilt-selective cells transform egocentric rotation signals into allocentric tilt velocity signals, to track head motion relative to gravity, and translation-selective cells encode otolith prediction error. Here we show that, despite very distinct simple spike response properties, both types of Purkinje cells emit complex spikes that are proportional to sensory prediction error. This indicates that both cell populations comprise a single olivo-cerebellar loop, in which only translation-selective cells project to the inferior olive. We propose a neural network model where sensory prediction errors computed by translation-selective cells are used as a teaching signal for both populations, and demonstrate that this network can learn to implement an internal model of the otoliths.</p>",2021-05-10

WHO-recommended prevalence thresholds for deciding schistosomiasis mass drug administration (MDA) are based on anecdotal evidence and unclear.

Objectives
This systematic review and meta-analysis, commissioned by the WHO as part of its new evidence-based guideline for schistosomiasis control, was to generate a single global prevalence threshold that should be applied in MDA programmes worldwide.  

Methods
We searched several databases from 1979 to 31st March 2021 without language restriction. Two reviewers selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using relevant risk of bias tools, and resolved disagreements through discussion. The review followed the PRISMA guidelines. Data were analysed and presented as prevalence reduction (PR) and relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference for continuous outcomes with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-regression of observations on prevalence rates and intensity of infection of MDA programmes and sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the results to the risk of bias components were performed. Evidence on benefits, harms, values, preferences, compliance, acceptability, equity and feasibility were also assessed. The overall level of evidence was graded using GRADE. 

Results
Out of 1,232 studies retrieved, 38 studies met our inclusion criteria and 34 studies were included in the meta-analysis. No direct relation was observed between prevalence and intensity of infection. Praziquantel reduced prevalence of S. haematobium in school age children (SAC) at 12 months (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.52; 8 studies, n=37,868); at 24 months (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.52; 7 studies; n=37,107); and 36 months (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.71; 5 studies, n=28,146). There was no significant reduction in prevalence at 48 months (2 studies, n=10,954). For S. mansoni, there were reductions in prevalence at 12 months (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.69; 14 studies, n=86,073); 24 months (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.66; 14 studies; n=83,721); 36 months (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.58; 7 studies, n=70,933) and 48 months (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.59; 5 studies; n=27,483). Further analyses were performed from a series of created prevalence thresholds of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30% and ≥40% showed differences in effect of MDA when each of the thresholds was applied. For annual MDA of school age children (SAC), school-based treatment (SBT) appeared to perform better than community-wide treatment (CWT) in terms of prevalence reduction. Using the same prevalence threshold for the different schistosome species, the model suggested, that it will take a shorter time to reach elimination for S. haematobium than S. mansoni; annual MDA using SBT approach for S. haematobium will require about 10 years to achieve elimination whereas it will take over 10 years to around 15 years to achieve elimination for S. mansoni. 

Conclusion
The evidence presented in this systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that 10% prevalence should be used as the global threshold for implementing MDA in endemic countries.</p>",2021-05-10

However, gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients suggests that the gut may present another viral target organ. Disease development and severity is dependent on viral interaction with two cell surface human proteins, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, and on antiviral response which may lead to systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction. Understanding the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the pathology of the disease will be greatly enhanced by the development of appropriate animal models. Laboratory mice have been the mainstay of therapeutic and vaccine development, however, the virus does not grow in wild type mice and only induced mild disease in transgenic animals expressing human ACE2. As there are known differences between immune response in laboratory mice and humans we evaluated the response of human gut developed as xenografts and host mouse gut following systemic LPS injections as a hyperinflammation model system. The orthologous gene expression levels in the mouse and human gut were highly correlated (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient: 0.28–0.76) and gene set enrichment analysis of significantly upregulated human and mouse genes revealed that a number of inflammatory and immune response pathways are commonly regulated in the two species. However, species differences were also observed, most importantly, in the inflamed human gut but not in the mouse gut, there was clear upregulation of mRNAs coding for TMPRSS2, ADAM17 and for RIG-I-like receptors, which are involved in the recognition of viruses and in antiviral innate immune response. Moreover, using species-specific immunofluorescence microscopy, we demonstrated the expression and localization of human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins, which are essential elements of the molecular machinery that enables SARS-CoV-2 to infect and replicate in human gut cells.

Interestingly, human genomes contain tRNA variants with the potential to mistranslate. Cells cope with increased mistranslation through multiple mechanisms, though high levels cause proteotoxic stress. The goal of this study was to compare the genetic interactions and the impact on transcriptome and cellular growth of two tRNA variants that mistranslate at a similar frequency but create different amino acid substitutions in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. One tRNA variant inserts alanine at proline codons whereas the other inserts serine for arginine. Both tRNAs decreased growth rate, with the effect being greater for arginine to serine than for proline to alanine. The tRNA that substituted serine for arginine resulted in a heat shock response. In contrast, heat shock response was minimal for proline to alanine substitution. Further demonstrating the significance of the amino acid substitution, transcriptome analysis identified unique up- and downregulated genes in response to each mistranslating tRNA. Number and extent of negative synthetic genetic interactions also differed depending upon type of mistranslation. Based on the unique responses observed for these mistranslating tRNAs, we predict that the potential of mistranslation to exacerbate diseases caused by proteotoxic stress depends on the tRNA variant.

To do so, we grew populations of T. thermophila with varying levels of genetic diversity at increasingly warmer temperatures and quantified their intrinsic population growth rate, r. We found that genetic diversity increases population growth at cooler temperatures, but that as temperature increases, this effect almost completely disappears. We also show that a combination of changes in the amount of expressed genetic diversity (G), plastic changes in population growth across temperatures (E), and strong GxE interactions, underlie this temperature effect.

Goldman'}, {'name': 'Rajalakshmi Veeranan-Karmegam'}, {'name': 'Graydon B. Gonsalvez'}]","<p>Egalitarian (Egl) is an RNA adaptor for the Dynein motor and is thought to link numerous, perhaps hundreds, of mRNAs with Dynein. Dynein, in turn, is responsible for the transport and localization of these mRNAs. Studies have shown that efficient mRNA binding by Egl requires the protein to dimerize. We recently demonstrated that Dynein light chain (Dlc) is responsible for facilitating the dimerization of Egl. Mutations in Egl that fail to interact with Dlc do not dimerize, and as such, are defective for mRNA binding. Consequently, this mutant does not efficiently associate with BicaudalD (BicD), the factor responsible for linking the Egl/mRNA complex with Dynein. In this report, we tested whether artificially dimerizing this Dlc-binding mutant using a leucine zipper would restore mRNA binding and rescue mutant phenotypes in vivo. Interestingly, we found that although artificial dimerization of Egl restored BicD binding, it only partially restored mRNA binding. As a result, Egl-dependent phenotypes, such as oocyte specification and mRNA localization, were only partially rescued. We hypothesize that Dlc-mediated dimerization of Egl results in a three-dimensional conformation of the Egl dimer that is best suited for mRNA binding. Although the leucine zipper restores Egl dimerization, it likely does not enable Egl to assemble into the conformation required for maximal mRNA binding activity.</p>",2021-05-13

Here we demonstrate new AFM cantilevers fabricated with a planar microcoil at the tip region, which can be used to generate or sense highly-localized magnetic fields. Torsion/bending actuation of the cantilevers is accomplished with simple experimental configurations, enabling quantitative and simultaneous mapping of both stiffness and friction at the sample surface with more than one order of magnitude improvement in compositional contrast. Our method is compatible with commercial AFM systems, allowing us to clearly resolve small stiffness and friction variations in copolymer and biological samples that were difficult to detect by conventional AFM methods. In combination with fluorescence microscopy, we also generated localized fields to selectively stimulate and monitor structural changes in viable cells with nm-scale detail.

First, we optimized image preprocessing to increase the algorithm’s sensitivity to mismatches in registered images. Second, we developed an attention-gated simulated annealing (Monte Carlo) procedure capable of focusing on the differences between perinatal brains. Third, we applied classical multidimensional scaling (CMDS) to align (“synchronize”) brain samples in time, accounting for individual development paces. We tested this multi-step algorithm on 28 samples of whole-mounted perinatal mouse brains (P0 – P9) and observed accurate registration results.

We demonstrate that complex formation is coincident with a large-scale conformational change in the colicin. In vivo crosslinking experiments and further simulations of the translocation process indicate that part of the colicin engages active transport by disguising itself to part of the cellular receptor.

Since the pioneering work of Shallice and Burgess (1991), it has been known that complex, naturalistic tasks can capture deficits that are missed in these classical tests. Matching this finding, deficits in several classical tasks are predicted by loss of fluid intelligence, linked to damage in a specific cortical “multiple-demand” (MD) network, while deficits in a more naturalistic task are not. To expand on these previous results, we examined the effect of focal brain lesions on three new tests – a modification of the previously-used Hotel task, a new test of task switching after extended delays, and a test of decision-making in imagined real-life scenarios. As potential predictors of impairment we measured volume of damage to <italic>a priori</italic> MD and default mode (DMN) networks, as well as cortical damage outside these networks. Deficits in the three new tasks were substantial, but were not explained by loss of fluid intelligence, or by volume of damage to either MD or DMN networks. Instead, deficits were associated with diverse lesions, and not strongly correlated with one another. The results confirm that naturalistic tasks capture cognitive deficits beyond those measured by fluid intelligence. We suggest, however, that these deficits may not arise from specific control operations required by complex behaviour. Instead, like everyday activities, complex tasks combine a rich variety of interacting cognitive components, bringing many opportunities for processing to be disturbed.</p>",2021-05-13

Then, the dihedral angle rotation model of loop region with partial inter-residue distance constraints is constructed, and the rotation angle satisfying the constraints is obtained by differential evolution algorithm, so as to adjust the spatial position relationship between the secondary structures. Lastly, the residue distance deviation is evaluated according to the difference between the conformation and the predicted distance, and the dihedral angle of the residue is optimized with biased probability. The final model is generated by iterating the above three steps. IPTDFold is tested on 462 benchmark proteins, 24 FM targets of CASP13, and 20 FM targets of CASP14.
