In the mammalian visual system, sensory neural responses and behavioral performance increase during an active behavioral state characterized by locomotion activity and pupil dilation, whereas preferred stimuli of individual neurons typically remain unchanged. Here, we address how behavioral states modulate stimulus selectivity in the context of colored natural scenes using a combination of large-scale population imaging, behavior, pharmacology, and deep neural network modeling. In visual cortex of awake mice, we identified a consistent shift of individual neuron color preferences towards ultraviolet stimuli during active behavioral periods that was particularly pronounced in the upper visual field. We found that the spectral shift in neural tuning is mediated by pupil dilation, resulting in a dynamic switch from rod-to cone-driven visual responses for constant ambient light levels. We further showed that this shift selectively enhances the discriminability of ultraviolet objects and facilitates the detection of ethological stimuli, such as aerial predators against the ultraviolet background of the twilight sky. Our results suggest a novel functional role for pupil dilation during active behavioral states as a bottom-up mechanism that, together with top-down neuromodulatory mechanisms, dynamically tunes visual representations to different behavioral demands.</p>",2021-09-06

We conducted a test-negative case-control study to assess the durability of protection after full vaccination with BNT162b2, defined as 14 days after the second dose, against polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a national medical practice between February 1, 2021 and August 22, 2021. We fit conditional logistic regression (CLR) models stratified on residential county and calendar time of testing to assess the association between time elapsed since vaccination and the odds of symptomatic infection or non-COVID-19 hospitalization (negative control), adjusted for several covariates. The primary population included 652 individuals who had a positive symptomatic test after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (cases) and 5,946 individuals with at least one negative symptomatic test after full vaccination (controls). The adjusted odds of symptomatic infection were higher 120 days after full vaccination versus at the date of full vaccination (Odds Ratio [OR]: 3.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33-7.74). Importantly, the odds of infection were still lower 150 days after the first BNT162b2 dose as compared to 4 days after the first dose (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.19-0.45), when immune protection approximates the unvaccinated status. Low rates of COVID-19 associated hospitalization or death in this cohort precluded analyses of these severe outcomes. The odds of experiencing a non-COVID-19 hospitalization decreased with time since vaccination, suggesting a possible underestimation of waning protection by this approach due to confounding factors. Taken together, these data constitute an early signal for waning protection against symptomatic illness while also providing reassurance that BNT162b2 continues to protect against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection several months after full vaccination. Continued surveillance of COVID-19 vaccine durability, particularly against severe disease, is critical to guide effective and equitable strategies to respond to the pandemic, including distribution of booster doses, development of new vaccines, and implementation of both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions.</p>",2021-09-07

To address these issues, we have developed practical methodologies and tools for generating low-cost, high-yield preparations of recombinant monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments directed to protein epitopes from primary sequences. We describe these methods here, as well as approaches to diversify monoclonal antibodies, including customization of antibody species specificity, generation of genetically encoded small antibody fragments, and conversion of single chain antibody fragments (e.g. scFv) into full-length, bivalent antibodies.

The relationship between functional network architectures recovered from these two types of neural activity remains unknown. Here we map electromagnetic networks (measured using magnetoencephalography; MEG) to haemodynamic networks (measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging; fMRI). We find that the relationship between the two modalities is regionally heterogeneous and systematically follows the cortical hierarchy, with close correspondence in unimodal cortex and poor correspondence in transmodal cortex, potentially reflecting patterns of laminar differentiation, recurrent subcortical input and neurovascular coupling. Correspondence between the two is largely driven by slower rhythms, particularly the delta (2-4 Hz) and beta (15-29 Hz) frequency band. Moreover, haemodynamic connectivity cannot be explained by electromagnetic activity in a single frequency band, but rather arises from the mixing of multiple neurophysiological rhythms. Collectively, these findings demonstrate highly organized but only partly overlapping patterns of connectivity in MEG and fMRI functional networks, opening fundamentally new avenues for studying the relationship between cortical micro-architecture and multi-modal connectivity patterns.</p>",2021-09-08

Zorn'}, {'name': 'Praneet Chaturvedi'}]","<p>Annotation of single cells has become an important step in the single cell analysis framework. With advances in sequencing technology thousands to millions of cells can be processed to understand the intricacies of the biological system in question. Annotation through manual curation of markers based on a priori knowledge is cumbersome given this exponential growth. There are currently ~200 computational tools available to help researchers automatically annotate single cells using supervised/unsupervised machine learning, cell type markers, or tissue-based markers from bulk RNA-seq. But with the expansion of publicly available data there is also a need for a tool which can help integrate multiple references into a unified atlas and understand how annotations between datasets compare.

How people decide to distribute cognitive control across targets and distractors remains unclear. To help address this question, we developed a parametric attentional control task with a graded manipulation to both target discriminability and distractor interference. We find that participants exert independent control over target and distractor processing. We measured control adjustments through the influence of incentives and previous conflict on target and distractor sensitivity, finding that these have dissociable influences on control. Whereas incentives preferentially led to target enhancement, conflict on the previous trial preferentially led to distractor suppression. These distinct drivers of control altered sensitivity to targets and distractors early in the trial, and were promptly followed by reactive reconfiguration towards task-appropriate feature sensitivity. Finally, we provide a process-level account of these findings by show that these control adjustments are well-captured by an evidence accumulation model with attractor dynamics over feature weights. These results help establish a process-level account of control configuration that provides new insights into how multivariate attentional signals are optimized to achieve task goals.</p>",2021-09-10

While promising, these scores are fraught with issues of portability across populations, due to the misestimation of effect sizes and missing causal loci across populations not represented in large-scale GWAS. The poor portability of polygenic scores at first seems at odds with the view that much of common genetic variation is shared among populations (Lewontin 1972). Here we investigate one potential cause of this discrepancy: phenotypic stabilizing selection drives the turnover of genetic variation shared between populations at causal loci. Somewhat counter-intuitively, while stabilizing selection to the same optimum phenotype leads to lower phenotypic differentiation among populations, it increases genetic differentiation at GWAS loci and reduces the portability of polygenic scores constructed for unrepresented populations. We also find that stabilizing selection can lead to potentially misleading signals of the differentiation of average polygenic scores among populations. We extend our baseline model to investigate the impact of pleiotropy, gene-by-environment interactions, and directional selection on polygenic score predictions. Our work emphasizes stabilizing selection as a null evolutionary model to understand patterns of allele frequency differentiation and its impact on polygenic score portability and differentiation.</p>",2021-09-11

PINK1 encodes a mitochondrial localised protein kinase that is a master-regulator of mitochondrial quality control pathways. Structural studies to date have elaborated the mechanism of how mutations located within the kinase domain disrupt PINK1 function, however, the molecular mechanism of PINK1 mutations located upstream and downstream of the kinase domain are unknown. We have employed mutagenesis studies of human PINK1 in cells to define the minimal region of PINK1, required for optimal ubiquitin phosphorylation, beginning at residue Ile111. Bioinformatic analysis of the region spanning Ile111 to the kinase domain and inspection of the AlphaFold human PINK1 structure model predicts a conserved N-terminal α-helical domain extension (NTE domain) within this region corroborated by hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) of recombinant insect PINK1 protein. The AlphaFold structure also predicts the NTE domain forms an intramolecular interaction with the C-terminal extension (CTE). Cell-based analysis of human PINK1 reveals that PD-associated mutations (e.g. Q126P), located within the NTE:CTE interface, markedly inhibit stabilization of PINK1; autophosphorylation at Serine228 (Ser228); and Ubiquitin Serine65 (Ser65) phosphorylation. Furthermore, we provide evidence that NTE domain mutants do not affect intrinsic catalytic kinase activity but do disrupt PINK1 stabilisation at the mitochondrial Translocase of outer membrane (TOM) complex. The clinical relevance of our findings is supported by the demonstration of defective stabilization and activation of endogenous PINK1 in human fibroblasts of a patient with early-onset PD due to homozygous PINK1 Q126P mutations. Overall, we define a functional role of the NTE:CTE interface towards PINK1 stabilisation and activation and show that loss of NTE:CTE interactions is a major mechanism of PINK1-associated mutations linked to PD.</p>",2021-09-06

It identifies complete sequences of peptides as well as sequence tags that are incomplete at one or both of the peptide termini. MaxNovo searches for the highest-scoring path in a directed acyclic graph representing the MS/MS spectrum with peaks as nodes and edges as potential sequence constituents consisting of single amino acids or pairs. The raw score is a sum of node and edge weights, plus several reward scores, for instance, for complementary ions or protease compatibility. For search-engine identified peptides, it correlates well with the Andromeda search engine score. We use a particular score normalization and the score difference between the first and second-best solution to define a combined score that integrates all available information. To evaluate its performance, we use a human cell line dataset and take as ground truth all Andromeda-identified MS/MS spectra with an Andromeda score of at least 100. MaxNovo outperforms other software in particular in the high-sensitivity range of precision-coverage plots. We also identify incomplete sequence tags and study their statistical properties.

Hebbian synaptic plasticity is thought to be one mechanism by which correlations in spiking promote assembly formation during learning. While spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) rules for excitatory synapses have been well characterized, inhibitory STDP rules remain incomplete, particularly with respect to sub-classes of inhibitory interneurons. Here, we report that in layer 2/3 of the orbitofrontal cortex of mice, inhibition from parvalbumin (PV) interneurons onto excitatory (E) neurons follows a symmetric STDP function and mediates homeostasis in E-neuron firing rates. However, inhibition from somatostatin (SOM) interneurons follows an asymmetric, Hebbian STDP rule. We incorporate these findings in both large scale simulations and mean-field models to investigate how these differences in plasticity impact network dynamics and assembly formation. We find that plasticity of SOM inhibition builds lateral inhibitory connections and increases competition between assemblies. This is reflected in amplified correlations between neurons within assembly and anti-correlations between assemblies. An additional finding is that the emergence of tuned PV inhibition depends on the interaction between SOM and PV STDP rules. Altogether, we show that incorporation of differential inhibitory STDP rules promotes assembly formation through competition, while enhanced inhibition both within and between assemblies protects new representations from degradation after the training input is removed.</p>",2021-09-07

We compare the genetic (co)variance input by spontaneous mutations accumulated under minimal selection to the standing genetic (co)variance in a set of ∼50 wild isolates. Three conclusions emerge. First, with one exception, mutations increase susceptibility to pathogens, and susceptibility is uncorrelated with fitness in the absence of pathogens. Second, the orientation in trait space of the heritable (co)variance of wild isolates is sufficiently explained by mutation. However, pathogen susceptibility is clearly under purifying, apparently directional, selection of magnitude similar to that of competitive fitness in the MA conditions. The results provide no evidence for fitness tradeoffs between pathogen susceptibility and fitness in the absence of pathogens, nor that balancing selection is important in maintaining genetic variation for susceptibility to these bacterial pathogens.</p>",2021-09-08

In this study, we demonstrate that hypochlorous acid (HOCl) induces the expression of msrPQ in a YedVW dependant manner, whereas H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, NO and paraquat (a superoxide generator) do not. Therefore, YedV appears to be an HOCl-sensing histidine kinase.

Given that HOCl oxidizes preferentially Met residues, we bring evidences that HypV could be activated via the reversible oxidation of its methionine residues, thus conferring to MsrPQ a role in switching HypVW off. Based on these results, we propose that the activation of HypV by HOCl could occur through a Met redox switch. HypVW appears to be the first characterized TCS able to detect HOCl in E. coli.

However, how SARS-CoV-2 circumvents Nsp1-mediated suppression for viral protein synthesis and if the mechanism can be targeted therapeutically remain unclear. Here we show that N- and C-terminal domains of Nsp1 coordinate to drive a tuned ratio of viral to host translation, likely to maintain a certain level of host fitness while maximizing replication. We reveal that the SL1 region of the SARS-CoV-2 5’ UTR is necessary and sufficient to evade Nsp1-mediated translational suppression. Targeting SL1 with locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) inhibits viral translation and makes SARS-CoV-2 5’ UTR vulnerable to Nsp1 suppression, hindering viral replication in vitro at a nanomolar concentration. Thus, SL1 allows Nsp1 to switch infected cells from host to SARS-CoV-2 translation, presenting a therapeutic target against COVID-19 that is conserved among immune-evasive variants.

Here, we combine CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing with in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the direct link between genes, proteins, and the brain connectome. The extensive knowledge of the Slc18a2 gene encoding the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2), involved in the storage and release of dopamine, makes it an excellent basis for studying the gene networks relationships. We edited Slc18a2 into the substantia nigra pars compacta of adult rats and used in vivo molecular imaging, behavioral, histological, and biochemical assessments to characterize the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated VMAT2 knockdown. Simultaneous PET/fMRI was performed to inspect the functional brain adaptations, beyond the predicted dopaminergic changes. Further, [11C]flumazenil PET was carried out to investigate the dopamine-GABA interplay. We found a regional increase in postsynaptic dopamine receptor availability, preceded by a reorganization of brain networks that adapt to reduced dopamine transmission states by becoming functionally connected and organized. The hyperconnectivity within and between brain networks spreads from the contralateral thalamus and prefrontal cortical regions to the striata and hippocampi. Additionally, impaired striatal dopamine release reduces GABA-A receptor availability, complementing the increased synchrony and functional connectivity between networks observed at rest. Our study reveals that recruiting different brain networks may be an early response to the dopaminergic dysfunction preceding neuronal cell loss, postsynaptic changes, and motor impairment in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease.

John'}, {'name': 'Basilis Zikopoulos'}, {'name': 'Miguel Ángel García-Cabezas'}, {'name': 'Helen Barbas'}]","<p>High-level characterizations of the primate cerebral cortex sit between two extremes: on one end the cortical mantle is seen as a mosaic of structurally and functionally unique areas, and on the other it is seen as a uniform six-layered structure in which functional differences are defined solely by extrinsic connections. Neither of these extremes captures the crucial neuroanatomical finding: that the cortex exhibits systematic gradations in architectonic structure. These gradations have been shown to predict cortico-cortical connectivity, which in turn suggests powerful ways to ground connectomics in anatomical structure, and by extension cortical function. A challenge to more widespread use of this concept is the labor-intensive and invasive nature of histological staining, which is the primary means of recognizing anatomical gradations. Here we show that a novel computational analysis technique can be used to derive a coarse-grained picture of cortical variation. For each of 78 cortical areas spanning the entire cortical mantle of the rhesus macaque, we created a high dimensional set of anatomical features derived from captured images of cortical tissue stained for myelin and SMI-32. The method involved semi-automated de-noising of images, and enabled comparison of brain areas without hand-labeling of features such as layer boundaries. We applied nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to the dataset to visualize similarity among cortical areas. This analysis shows a systematic variation between weakly laminated (limbic) cortices and sharply laminated (eulaminate) cortices. We call this smooth continuum the ‘cortical spectrum’. We also show that this spectrum is visible within subsystems of the cortex: the occipital, parietal, temporal, motor, prefrontal, and insular cortices. We compared the NMDS-derived spectrum with a spectrum produced using T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data derived from macaque, and found close agreement of the two coarse-graining methods. This evidence suggests that T1/T2 data, routinely obtained in human MRI studies, can be used as an effective proxy for data derived from high-resolution histological methods. More generally, this approach shows that the cortical spectrum is robust to the specific method used to compare cortical areas, and is therefore a powerful tool to understand the principles of organization of the primate cortex.</p>",2021-09-10

Many complex scenes contain sensory stimuli, e.g., natural sounds, images, odors or vibrations, which are highly dynamic in time, competing with stimuli at other locations in space. PV neurons are thought to play a fundamental role in sculpting cortical temporal dynamics; yet their specific role in encoding complex scenes via timing-based codes, and the robustness of such temporal representations to spatial competition, have not been investigated. Here, we address these questions in auditory cortex using a cocktail party-like paradigm; integrating electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulations, and a family of novel spike-distance metrics, to dissect the contributions of PV neurons towards rate and timing-based coding. We find that PV neurons improve cortical discrimination of dynamic naturalistic sounds in a cocktail party-like setting by enhancing rapid temporal modulations in rate and spike timing reproducibility. Moreover, this temporal representation is maintained in the face of competing stimuli at other spatial locations, providing a robust code for complex scene analysis.

However, current approaches are primarily based on unsupervised approaches, without use of information in nIDPs. In this paper, we proposed Supervised BigFLICA (SuperBigFLICA), a semi-supervised, multimodal, and multi-task fusion approach for IDP discovery, which simultaneously integrates information from multiple imaging modalities as well as multiple nIDPs. SuperBigFLICA is computationally efficient and largely bypasses the need for parameter tuning. Using the UK Biobank brain imaging dataset with around 40,000 subjects and 47 modalities, along with more than 17,000 nIDPs, we showed that SuperBigFLICA enhances the prediction power of nIDPs, bench-marked against IDPs derived by conventional expert-knowledge and unsupervised-learning approaches (with average nIDP prediction accuracy improvements of up to 46%). It also enables learning of generic imaging features that can predict new nIDPs. Further empirical analysis of the SuperBigFLICA algorithm demonstrates its robustness in different prediction tasks and the ability to derive biologically meaningful IDPs in predicting health outcomes and cognitive nIDPs, such as fluid intelligence and hypertension scores.</p>",2021-09-06

The gene expression pattern formed over the course of ZGA is required for establishing totipotency in early embryos and subsequent development. Substantial epigenetic reprogramming contributes significantly to the pronounced change in gene expression during ZGA, however the mechanism has yet to be resolved. Here, we find histone deacetylase 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2) are critical histone modifiers that regulate ZGA through the histone deacetylase activity. Notably, we show that H3K27ac level declines dramatically during ZGA with a dynamic change in its genome-wide distribution. In mouse embryos, ectopic expression of HDAC1/2 dominant negative mutant leads to a failure of H3K27ac removal and a developmental arrest at 2-cell stage. RNA-seq results reveal a remarkable transcriptomic change with 6565 differentially expressed genes identified. Further analysis shows 64% of down-regulated genes are ZGA genes and 49% of up-regulated genes are developmental genes. Low input ChIP-seq analysis exhibits an increase and decrease of H3K27ac enrichment at the promoter region of up- and down-regulated genes, respectively. Moreover, HDAC1 mutants prohibited removal of broad H3K4me3 domain via impeding the expression of Kdm5s during ZGA. Importantly, the developmental block can be greatly overcome through injection of Kdm5b mRNA and expression of the majority of dysregulated genes partially corrected. Similar functional significance of HDAC1/2 in ZGA is conserved in bovine embryos. Together, we propose that HDAC1/2 is indispensable for mouse and bovine ZGA via creating correct transcriptional repressive and active states.</p>",2021-09-11

High-frequency activity of a thalamic input can be temporally integrated by a neuron in the sensory cortex and is likely to induce larger depolarization. However, feedforward inhibition (FFI) and depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in thalamocortical pathways attenuate depolarization induced by the latter part of high-frequency spiking activity and the temporal summation may not be effective. The spiking activity of a thalamic neuron in a specific temporal pattern may circumvent FFI and depression of excitatory synapses. The present study determined the relationship between the temporal pattern of spiking activity of a single thalamic neuron and the degree of cortical activation as well as that between the firing rate of spiking activity of a single thalamic neuron and the degree of cortical activation. Spiking activity of a thalamic neuron was recorded extracellularly from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in male Long-Evans rats. Degree of cortical activation was assessed by simultaneous recording of local field potential (LFP) from the visual cortex. A specific temporal pattern appearing in three consecutive spikes of an LGN neuron induced larger cortical LFP modulation than high-frequency spiking activity during a short period. These findings indicate that spiking activity of thalamic inputs is integrated by a synaptic mechanism sensitive to an input temporal pattern.</p>",2021-09-10

Synthesis and experimental pharmacokinetics measurements are, however, expensive, and time-consuming. In this work, we aimed to obtain drug residence times computationally. Furthermore, we propose a novel algorithm to identify molecular design objectives based on ligand unbinding kinetics. We designed an enhanced sampling technique to accurately predict the free energy profiles of the ligand unbinding process, focusing on the free energy barrier for unbinding. Our method first identifies unbinding paths determining a corresponding set of internal coordinates (IC) that form contacts between the protein and the ligand, then iteratively updates these interactions during a series of biased molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal the ICs important for the whole of the unbinding process. Subsequently, we performed finite temperature string simulations to obtain the free energy barrier for unbinding using the set of ICs as a complex reaction coordinate. Importantly, we also aimed to enable further design of drugs focusing on improved residence times. To this end, we developed a supervised machine learning (ML) approach that uses as input unbiased “downhill” trajectories from the transition state (TS) ensemble of the string unbinding path. We demonstrate that our ML method can identify key ligand-protein interactions driving the system through the TS. Some of the most important drugs for cancer treatment are kinase inhibitors. One of these kinase targets is Cyclin Dependent Kinase 2 (CDK2), an appealing target for anticancer drug development. Here, we tested our method using three different CDK2 inhibitors for potential further development of these compounds. We compared the free energy barriers obtained from our calculations with those observed in available experimental data. We highlighted important interactions at the distal ends of the ligands that can be targeted for improved residence times.

However a causal role of neurons in LIP remains controversial. We used pharmacological and chemogenetic methods to inactivate LIP in one hemisphere of four rhesus monkeys. Inactivation produced clear biases in decisions, but the effects dissipated despite the persistence  of neural inactivation, implying compensation by other unaffected areas.

Specifically, trial-to-trial fluctuations in cortical excitability have been linked to fluctuations in the amplitude of pre-stimulus alpha oscillations (~8-13 Hz), which are in turn are associated with fluctuations in subjects' tendency to report the detection of a stimulus. It is currently unknown whether alpha oscillations bias post-perceptual decision making, or even bias subjective perception itself. To answer this question, we used a contrast discrimination task in which subjects reported which of two gratings -- one in each hemifield -- was perceived as having a stronger contrast. Our EEG analysis showed that subjective contrast was reduced for the stimulus in the hemifield represented in the hemisphere with relatively stronger pre-stimulus alpha amplitude, reflecting reduced cortical excitability. Furthermore, the strength of this spontaneous hemispheric lateralization was strongly correlated with the magnitude of individual subjects' biases, suggesting that the spontaneous patterns of alpha lateralization play a role in explaining the inter-subject variability in contrast perception. These results indicate that spontaneous fluctuations in cortical excitability, indicted by patterns of pre-stimulus alpha amplitude, affect perceptual decisions by altering the phenomenological perception of the visual world.</p>",2021-09-10
