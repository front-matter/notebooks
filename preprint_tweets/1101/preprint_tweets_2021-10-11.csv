However, the separation of single-molecule fluorescence events in thousands of frames dramatically increases the image acquisition time and phototoxicity, impeding the observation of instantaneous intracellular dynamics. Based on deep learning networks, we develop a single-frame super-resolution microscopy (SFSRM) approach that reconstructs a super-resolution image from a single frame of a diffraction-limited image to support live-cell super-resolution imaging at a ~20 nm spatial resolution and a temporal resolution of up to 10 ms over thousands of time points. We demonstrate that our SFSRM method enables the visualization of the dynamics of vesicle transport at a millisecond temporal resolution in the dense and vibrant microtubule network in live cells. Moreover, the well-trained network model can be used with different live-cell imaging systems, such as confocal and light-sheet microscopes, making super-resolution microscopy accessible to nonexperts.</p>",2021-10-09

Preclinical findings suggest altered molecular rhythms in the brain are involved in opioid reward and dependence. However, whether molecular rhythms are disrupted in brains of people with OUD remained an open question, critical to understanding the role of circadian rhythms in opioid addiction. We previously used subjects' times of death (TOD) as a marker of time of day to investigate transcriptional rhythm alterations in psychiatric disorders. Using TOD and RNA sequencing, we discovered rhythmic transcripts in both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), key brain areas involved in opioid addiction, were largely distinct between OUD and unaffected comparison subjects. Further, fewer rhythmic transcripts were identified in DLPFC of OUD subjects compared to unaffected subjects, but nearly double the number of rhythmic transcripts were found in the NAc of OUD subjects. In OUD, rhythmic transcripts in the NAc peaked either in the evening or near sunrise, and were associated with dopamine, opioid, and GABAergic neurotransmission. Co-expression network analysis identified several OUD-specific modules in the NAc, enriched for transcripts involved in the modulation of dopamine and GABA synapses, including glutamatergic signaling and extracellular matrices. Integrative analyses with human GWAS revealed that rhythmic transcripts in DLPFC and NAc were enriched for genomic loci associated with sleep duration and insomnia. Overall, our results connect transcriptional rhythm changes in dopamine, opioid, and GABAergic synaptic signaling in human brain to sleep-related phenotypes and OUD.</p>",2021-10-09

Effector discovery is generally done manually, and computational approaches used for effector discovery depend on genetic linkage to T6SS genes and/or sequence similarity to known effectors. We bioinformatically investigated T6SS in more than 11,832 genomes of Gram negative bacteria. We found that T6SS encoding bacteria are host-associated and pathogenic, enriched in specific human and plant tissues, while depleted in marine, soil, and engineered environments. Analysis of T6SS cores with C-terminal domains (""evolved"" cores) showed ""evolved"" HCP are rare, overwhelmingly encoded in orphan operons, and are largely restricted to Escherichia. Using the wealth of data generated from our bioinformatic analysis, we developed two algorithms for large-scale discovery of T6SS effector proteins (T6Es). We experimentally validated ten putative antibacterial T6SS effector proteins and one cognate immunity gene from a diverse species. This study provides a systematic genomic perspective of the role of the T6SS in nature, a thorough analysis of T6E evolution and genomic properties, and discovery of a large number of candidate T6Es using new approaches.</p>",2021-10-07

In highly regulative embryos, like those of mammals, morphological variability hinders the quantitative analysis of morphogenesis. In particular, the study of early heart development in mammals remains a challenging problem, due to imaging limitations and innate complexity. Around embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5), the cardiac crescent folds in an intricate and coordinated manner to produce a pumping linear heart tube at E8.25, followed by heart looping at E8.5. In this work we provide a complete morphological description of this process based on detailed imaging of a temporally dense collection of embryonic heart morphologies. We apply new approaches for morphometric staging and quantification of local morphological variations between specimens at the same stage. We identify hot spots of regionalized variability and identify left-right asymmetry in the inflow region starting at the late cardiac crescent stage, which represents the earliest signs of organ left-right asymmetry in the mammalian embryo. Finally, we generate a 3D+t digital model that provides a framework suitable for co-representation of data from different sources and for the computer modelling of the process.</p>",2021-10-09

Since the SR complex can form <italic>de novo</italic>, the role of the LR complex (i.e., DNAPKcs) for chromosomal EJ is unclear. We have examined EJ of chromosomal blunt DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and found that DNAPKcs is significantly less important than XLF and XRCC4 for such EJ. However, weakening XLF via disrupting interaction interfaces (e.g., disrupting the XLF homodimer interface) causes a marked requirement for DNAPKcs, its kinase activity, and its ABCDE-cluster autophosphorylation sites for blunt DSB EJ. In contrast, other aspects of genome maintenance are sensitive to DNAPKcs kinase inhibition in a manner that is not further enhanced by XLF loss (i.e., suppression of homology-directed repair and structural variants, and IR-resistance). We suggest that DNAPKcs is required to position a weakened XLF in an LR complex that can transition into a functional SR complex for blunt DSB EJ, but also has distinct functions for other aspects of genome maintenance.</p>",2021-10-07

Here, we developed a computational framework to catalog and profile antisense RNAs and applied it to poorly and highly metastatic breast cancer cell lines. We identified one antisense RNA that plays a functional role in driving breast cancer progression by upregulating the redox enzyme NQO1, and hence named NQO1-antisense RNA or NQO1-AS. This upregulation occurs via a stabilizing interaction between NQO1-AS and its complementary region in the 3'UTR of NQO1 mRNA. By increasing expression of NQO1 protein, breast cancer cells are able to tolerate higher levels of oxidative stress, enabling them to colonize the lung. During this process the cancer cells become dependent on NQO1 to protect them from ferroptosis. We have shown that this dependence can be exploited therapeutically in xenograft models of metastasis. Together, our findings establish a previously unknown role for NQO1-AS in the progression of breast cancer by serving as a post-transcriptional regulator of RNA processing and decay for its sense mRNA.</p>",2021-10-09

But what is the visual system’s minimal exposure threshold to detect meaningful stimuli? Due to hardware limitations, studies examining fast visual processing typically present stimuli for suprathreshold durations and disrupt processing with a mask. Here, we employed a newly developed tachistoscope that enables sub-millisecond presentations. Combining measures of perceptual sensitivity and recordings of neural activity, we find that both the holistic configuration and the emotional expression of a human face have the same minimal required exposure as the minimal required exposure for faces to reach awareness.

The role and pathways of endogenous and environmental mechanisms in the ontogeny of lateralisation remains to be established. The domestic chick is a model of both endogenous and experience-induced lateralisation driven by light exposure. Following the endogenous rightward rotation of the embryo, the asymmetrical position in the egg results in a greater exposure of the right eye to environmental light. To identify the genetic pathways activated by asymmetric light stimulation, and their time course, we exposed embryos to different light regimes: darkness, 6 hours of light and 24 hours of light. We used RNA-seq to compare gene expression in the right and left retinas and telencephalon. As expected, no differential expression between left and right was present in darkness. We detected differential gene expression in right vs left retina after 6 hours of light exposure. This difference disappeared before 24 hours of light exposure, suggesting that light-induced activation is a self-terminating phenomenon. This transient effect of light exposure was associated with a downregulation of the sensitive-period mediator gene DIO2 (iodothyronine deiodinase 2) in the right retina. No differences between genes expressed in the right vs. left telencephalon were detected. Gene networks associated with lateralisation were connected to vascularisation, cell motility, and the extracellular matrix. Interestingly, we know that the extracellular matrix - including the differentially expressed PDGFRB (platelet-derived growth factor receptor β) gene - is involved in both sensitive periods and in the endogenous chiral mechanism of primary cilia, that drives lateralisation. Our data show a similarity between endogenous and experience-driven lateralisation, identifying functional gene networks that affect lateralisation in a specific time window.</p>",2021-10-09

Determination of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion concentrations in the presence of copolymer shows that divalent cation tolerance is dependent on not only specific characteristics of a copolymer, but also on its concentration. We see that high ionic strength protects against aggregation facilitated by divalent cations, which is prominent in nanodiscs isolated from excess free copolymer through dialysis. Overall, we conclude that the behavior of amphiphilic copolymers in the presence of divalent cations is more complex than precipitation beyond a specific cation concentration.</p>",2021-10-07

Unfortunately, therapeutic efficacy is inconsistent, possibly a result of our limited understanding of the mechanisms and the massive stimulation parameter space.
Objective/Hypothesis: To better understand the role different parameters play in inducing a response, we systematically examined single pulse-induced cortico-cortico evoked potentials (CCEP) as a function of stimulation amplitude, duration and location in the brain and relative to grey and white matter. 
Methods: We measured voltage peak amplitudes and area under the curve of intracranially recorded stimulation responses as a function of distance from the stimulation site, pulse width, current injected, location relative to grey and white matter, and brain region stimulated (N=52, n=719 stimulation sites). 
Results: Increasing stimulation pulse width increased response values near the stimulation location. Increasing stimulation amplitude (current) increased responses nonlinearly. Locally (&lt;15 mm from the stimulation site), stimulation closer to the grey matter-white matter boundary induced larger responses. In contrast, for distant sites (&gt;15 mm), white matter stimulation consistently produced larger responses than stimulation in or near grey matter. These relationships were different between cingulate, lateral prefrontal, and lateral temporal cortical stimulation. 
Conclusion: These results demonstrate the importance of location and stimulation parameters in inducing a specific output and indicate that a stronger local response may require stimulation in the grey-white boundary while stimulation in the white matter may be needed for network activation, suggesting that stimulation location can be tailored for a specific outcome, key to informed neuromodulatory therapy.</p>",2021-10-09

203 isolates from stool and rectal swabs from adults were whole-genome sequenced and compared to a publicly available multicountry collection of 484 K. pneumoniae genomes sampled to cover maximum diversity of the species, 150 previously sequenced Malawian and 66 Kenyan isolates from blood or sterile sites. We inferred phylogenetic relationships and analysed the diversity of genetic loci linked to AMR, virulence, capsule (K-) and LPS O-antigen (O-types). 

We find that the diversity of Malawian Klebsiella isolates is representative of the species population structure, but with local success and expansion of sequence types (STs) ST14, ST15, ST340 and ST307. Siderophore and hypermucoidy genes were more frequent in invasive versus carriage isolates (present in 13% vs 1%, p &lt; 0.001) but still generally lacking in most invasive isolates. The population structure and distribution of O-antigen types was similar in Malawian invasive and carriage isolates, with O4 being more common in Malawian isolates (14%) than in previously published studies (2-5%).

Distinct ST and O-type distributions in Malawi highlights the need for geographically aware sampling to robustly define secular trends in Klebsiella diversity. Colonising and invasive isolates in Blantyre are similar and hence O-typing of colonising Klebsiella isolates may be a rapid and cost-effective approach to describe global diversity and guide vaccine development.</p>",2021-10-07

We examined how obstacle field height, wind presence and direction (headwinds or tailwinds) affected altitude, ground speed, and side-to-side casting (lateral excursions) of bees. When obstacle fields were short, bees flew at altitudes near the midpoint between the tunnel floor and ceiling. When obstacle fields approached or exceeded this midpoint, bees typically, but not always, increased their altitudes to fly over the obstacles. Bees that flew above the obstacle fields exhibited 40% faster ground speeds and 36% larger lateral excursions than bees that flew within the obstacle fields, likely due to the visual feedback from obstacles and narrow space available within the obstacle field. Wind had a strong effect on ground speed and lateral excursions, but not altitude. Bees flew 12-19% faster in tailwinds than in the other wind conditions, but their lateral excursions were 19% larger in any wind, regardless of its direction, than in still air.

Smaller effective populations harbor less genetic diversity and stochastic processes are generally expected to play a larger role, leading to less repeatable evolutionary trajectories. Empirical insight into the relationship between effective population size and repeatability is limited and biased towards asexual unicellular organisms. Here, we used populations of obligately outcrossing <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to test whether fitness increase and selection response were more heterogeneous after a moderate or strong population bottleneck compared to a scenario without bottleneck. Nematodes were exposed to a novel bacterial prey and lower temperature. Population sizes after one week of growth (as a proxy of fitness) were measured before and after 15 generations of evolution. We found that replicates across all (no/moderate/strong bottleneck) treatments evolved higher fitness and no significant difference in average or maximum fitness was found among treatments. Partitioning fitness variance among effects from selection and effects from chance showed that a strong (but not a moderate) bottleneck reduced the relative contribution of selection effects to fitness variation. However, the reduced contribution from selection did not translate to a significant reduction in the repeatability of fitness evolution. Thus, although a strong bottleneck reduced the contribution of deterministic evolutionary change, we found only marginal effects on quantitative measurements of repeatability in evolution.

We show that many of the events show a relative rate of duplicate gene loss prior to the first post-polyploidy speciation that is significantly higher than in later phases of their evolution. The relatively low selective constraint seen for the single-copy genes these losses produced lead us to suggest that most of the purely selectively neutral duplicate gene losses occur in the immediate post-polyploid period. We also find ongoing and extensive reciprocal gene losses (RGL; alternative losses of duplicated ancestral genes) between these genomes. With the exception of a handful of closely related taxa, all of these polyploid organisms are separated from each other by tens to thousands of reciprocal gene losses. As a result, it is very unlikely that viable diploid hybrid species could form between these taxa, since matings between such hybrids would tend to produce offspring lacking essential genes.

However, investigating CFS in Magneto- and Electroencephalography (MEG/EEG) is hampered by the presence of spurious neuronal interactions due to the non-sinusoidal waveshape of brain oscillations. Such waveshape gives rise to the presence of oscillatory harmonics mimicking genuine neuronal oscillations. Until recently, however, there has been no methodology for removing these harmonics from neuronal data. In order to address this long-standing challenge, we introduce a novel method (called HARMOnic miNImization - Harmoni) that removes the signal components which can be harmonics of a non-sinusoidal signal. Harmoni's working principle is based on the presence of CFS between harmonic components and the fundamental component of a non-sinusoidal signal. 
We extensively tested Harmoni in realistic EEG simulations. The simulated couplings between the source signals represented genuine and spurious CFS and within-frequency phase synchronization. Using diverse evaluation criteria, including ROC analyses, we showed that the within- and cross-frequency spurious interactions are suppressed significantly, while the genuine activities are not affected. Additionally, we applied Harmoni to real resting-state EEG data revealing intricate remote connectivity patterns which are usually masked by the spurious connections. Given the ubiquity of non-sinusoidal neuronal oscillations in electrophysiological recordings, Harmoni is expected to facilitate novel insights into genuine neuronal interactions in various research fields, and can also serve as a steppingstone towards the development of further signal processing methods aiming at refining within- and cross-frequency synchronization in electrophysiological recordings.</p>",2021-10-08

COOLAIR, an antisense noncoding RNA expressed at the FLC locus, is induced during the early phase of vernalization, preceding FLC suppression. However, the mechanism by which long-term cold induces COOLAIR is not well understood. Here, we showed that C-repeat (CRT)/dehydration-responsive elements (DREs) at the 3′-end of FLC and CRT/DRE-binding factors (CBFs) are required for vernalization-induced COOLAIR activation. The CBFs bind to CRT/DREs at the 3′-end of FLC, both in vitro and in vivo, and the CBFs levels increased gradually during vernalization. Additionally, vernalization-induced COOLAIR expression was highly suppressed in the cbfs mutant, in which all CBFs were knocked-out. Contrastingly, CBF-overexpressing plants showed COOLAIR upregulation, even at warm temperatures. We propose that COOLAIR is induced by CBFs in the early phase of vernalization but is downregulated as CBFs are evicted from closed FLC chromatin during the late vernalization phase. We also demonstrated that cbfs and COOLAIR mutants have a normal vernalization response, although they show defects in vernalization-induced COOLAIR activation, indicating that COOLAIR is not necessary for this process.</p>",2021-10-09

The overarching result is that LV models outperform MAR models in most cases and are generally superior for representing cases where the dependent variables deviate greatly from their steady states. A large dynamic range is particularly prevalent when the populations are highly abundant, change considerably over time, and exhibit a large signal-to-noise ratio.

Here, we report that a delayed (12-24h) increase in the expression of the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5), an immune receptor well known as a co-receptor for HIV infection, following the formation of a contextual memory, determines the duration of the temporal window for associating or linking that memory with subsequent memories. This delayed CCR5 expression in mouse dorsal CA1 (dCA1) neurons results in a decrease in neuronal excitability, which in turn negatively regulates neuronal memory allocation, thus reducing the overlap between dCA1 memory ensembles. Lowering this overlap affects the ability of one memory to trigger the recall of the other, thus closing the temporal window for memory linking. Remarkably, our findings also show that an age-related increase in CCL5/CCR5 expression leads to impairments in memory linking in aged mice, which could be reversed with a CCR5 knockout and an FDA approved drug that inhibits this receptor, a result with significant clinical implications.

The bacteriophage ICP1 is a key predator of epidemic <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and is notable for acquiring a CRISPR-Cas system to combat PLE, a defensive subviral parasite encoded by its <italic>V. cholerae</italic> host. Here we describe the discovery of five previously unknown PLE variants, including one found during recent surveillance of patient samples in Bangladesh. We also observed a lineage sweep of PLE negative <italic>V. cholerae</italic> occurring within a patient population in under a year which coincided with a loss of ICP1’s CRISPR-Cas system. These findings reinforce the importance of surveillance to better understand the selective pressures that drive pandemic cholera.</p>",2021-10-07

We carried out a genomic investigation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing <italic>E. coli</italic> colonising adults in Blantyre, Malawi to assess the diversity and AMR determinants and to place these isolates in the context of globally available genomes.

Whether these fluctuations are instrumental or epiphenomenal to the behavior remains elusive. Attempts to experimentally manipulate neural oscillations exogenously using non-invasive brain stimulation have shown some promise, but difficulty with tailoring stimulation parameters to individuals has hindered progress in this field. We demonstrate here using electroencephalography (EEG) neurofeedback in a brain-computer interface that human participants (n=44) learned over multiple sessions across a 6-day period to self-regulate their Beta rhythm (13-20 Hz) over the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC). This Beta modulation had observable consequences on cognitive behavior: changes in an individual's inhibitory control performance before and after training were predicted by the magnitude of their training-related change in Beta over rIFC. This was not the case for a control group (n=38) who underwent training of their Alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz). The present data support the view that the right frontal Beta rhythm is a key component of the brain's inhibitory control system. Most importantly, we introduce causality to this relationship for the first time, as experimental modulation of rIFC Beta activity had a measurable impact upon behavior.</p>",2021-10-09
