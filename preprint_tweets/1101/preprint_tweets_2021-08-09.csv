From the increased throughput of techniques to determine experimental structures, to developments such as cryo-EM that allow us to find the structures of large protein complexes or, more recently, the development of artificial intelligence tools, such as AlphaFold, that can predict with high accuracy the folding of proteins for which the availability of homology templates is limited.</p><p>Here we quantify the effect of the recently released AlphaFold database of protein structural models in our knowledge on human proteins. Our results indicate that our current baseline for structural coverage of 47%, considering experimentally-derived or template-based homology models, elevates up to 75% when including AlphaFold’s predictions, reducing the fraction of “dark proteome” from 22% to just 7% and the number of proteins without structural information from 4.832 to just 29.</p><p>Furthermore, although the coverage of disease-associated genes and mutations was near complete before AlphaFold release (70% of ClinVar’s pathogenic mutations and 74% of oncogenic mutations), AlphaFold models still provide an additional coverage of 2% to 14% of these critically important sets of biomedical genes and mutations. We also provide several examples of disease-associated proteins where AlphaFold provides critical new insights. Overall, our results show that the sequence-structure gap of human proteins has almost disappeared, an outstanding success of direct consequences for the knowledge on the human genome and the derived medical applications.</p>",2021-08-03

In this study, we performed integrated single-cell RNA- and scATAC-seq analysis in both mouse and human retina to profile dynamic changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility and transcription factor footprinting during retinal neurogenesis. We identified multiple interconnected, evolutionarily-conserved GRNs consisting of cell type-specific transcription factors that both activate expression of genes within their own network and often inhibit expression of genes in other networks. These GRNs control state transitions within primary retinal progenitors that underlie temporal patterning, regulate the transition from primary to neurogenic progenitors, and drive specification of each major retinal cell type. We confirmed the prediction of this analysis that the NFI transcription factors <italic>Nfia</italic>, <italic>Nfib</italic>, and <italic>Nfix</italic> selectively activate expression of genes that promote late-stage temporal identity in primary retinal progenitors. We also used GRNs to identify additional transcription factors that promote (<italic>Insm1/2</italic>) and inhibit (<italic>Tbx3</italic>, <italic>Tcf7l1</italic>/<italic>2</italic>) rod photoreceptor specification in postnatal retina. This study provides an inventory of cis- and trans-acting factors that control retinal development, identifies transcription factors that control the temporal identity of retinal progenitors and cell fate specification, and will potentially guide cell-based therapies aimed at replacing retinal neurons lost due to disease.</p>",2021-08-02

Here we used environmental metagenomics combined with analysis of physico-chemical data and 16S rRNA amplicons to characterize the diversity, temperature optima, and biogeographic distribution of sediment-hosted microorganisms at the recently discovered Auka vents in the Gulf of California, the deepest known hydrothermal vent field in the Pacific Ocean. We recovered 325 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) representing 54 phyla, over 1/3 of the currently known phylum diversity, showing the microbial community in Auka hydrothermal sediments is highly diverse. Large scale 16S rRNA amplicon screening of 227 sediment samples across the vent field indicates that the MAGs are largely representative of the microbial community. Metabolic reconstruction of a vent-specific, deeply branching clade within the Desulfobacterota (Tharpobacteria) suggests these organisms metabolize sulfur using novel octaheme cytochrome-c proteins related to hydroxylamine oxidoreductase. Community-wide comparison of the average nucleotide identity of the Auka MAGs with MAGs from the Guaymas Basin vent field, found 400 km to the Northwest, revealed a remarkable 20% species-level overlap between vent sites, suggestive of long-distance species transfer and sediment colonization. An adapted version of a recently developed model for predicting optimal growth temperature to the Auka and Guaymas MAGs indicates several of these uncultured microorganisms could grow at temperatures exceeding the currently known upper limit of life. Extending this analysis to reference data shows that thermophily is a trait that has evolved frequently among Bacteria and Archaea. Combined, our results show that Auka vent field offers new perspectives on our understanding of hydrothermal vent microbiology.</p>",2021-08-02

The acropetal gradient correlates with the developmental age of spikelets, however the basal spikelets are developed first and the cause of their small size and rudimentary development is unclear. Here, we adapted G&amp;T-seq, a low-input transcriptomics approach, to characterise gene expression profiles within spatial sections of individual spikes before and after the establishment of the lanceolate shape.

Antipsychotic drugs are thought to re-balance this output by blocking D2-receptor signaling. Here we imaged D1- and D2-SPN Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in mice to determine the neural signatures of antipsychotic effect. Initially we compared effective (clozapine and haloperidol) antipsychotics to a candidate drug that failed in clinical trials (MP-10). Clozapine and haloperidol normalized hyperdopaminergic D1-SPN dynamics, while MP-10 only normalized D2-SPN activity. Clozapine, haloperidol or chemogenetic manipulations of D1-SPNs also normalized sensorimotor gating. Given the surprising correlation between clinical efficacy and D1-SPN modulation, we evaluated compounds that selectively target D1-SPNs. D1R partial agonism, antagonism, or positive M4 cholinergic receptor modulation all normalized the levels of D1-SPN activity, locomotion, and sensorimotor gating.

Although vaccination advances at good pace, effectiveness against emerging variants is unpredictable. The virus has displayed a remarkable resistance to treatments and no drugs have been proved fully effective against Covid-19.

Here we exploited the enormous potential of plant metabolism using the bryophyte <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> and identified a potent SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, following a bioactivity-guided fractionation and mass-spectrometry approach. We found that the chlorophyll derivative Pheophorbide a (PheoA), a porphyrin compound similar to animal Protoporphyrin IX, has an extraordinary antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 preventing infection of cultured monkey and human cells, without noticeable cytotoxicity. We also show that PheoA prevents coronavirus entry into the cells by directly targeting the viral particle. Besides SARS-CoV-2, PheoA also displayed a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against (+) strand RNA viral pathogens such as HCV, West Nile, and other coronaviruses, but not against (−) strand RNA viruses, such as VSV. Our results indicate that PheoA displays a remarkable potency and a satisfactory therapeutic index, which together with its previous use in photoactivable cancer therapy in humans, suggest that it may be considered as a potential candidate for antiviral therapy against SARS-CoV-2.</p>",2021-08-02

Nevertheless, integrative analyses of such data remain scarce, in spite of their importance for crop improvement. We hypothesized that the co-occurrence of genomic regions for oil-related traits in different studies may reveal more stable regions encompassing important genetic determinants of oil content and quality in soybean. We integrated publicly available data, obtained with distinct techniques, to discover and prioritize candidate genes involved in oil biosynthesis and regulation in soybean. We detected key fatty acid biosynthesis genes (e.g., BCCP and ACCase, FADs, KAS family proteins) and several transcripton factors, which are likely regulators of oil biosynthesis. In addition, we identified new candidates for seed oil accumulation and quality, such as Glyma.03G213300 and Glyma.19G160700, which encode a translocator protein and a histone acetyltransferase, respectively. Further, oil and protein genomic hotspots are strongly associated with breeding and not with domestication, suggesting that soybean domestication prioritized other traits.

The inflammatory property is key to support the development of potent humoral immune responses. However, the mechanism by which this platform drives T follicular helper cells (Tfh) and humoral immune responses remains unknown. Here we show that lack of Langerhans cells or cDC1s neither significantly affected the induction of PR8 HA and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific Tfh cells and humoral immune responses, nor susceptibility towards the lethal challenge of influenza and SARS-CoV-2. However, the combined deletion of these two DC subsets led to a significant decrease in the induction of PR8 HA and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific Tfh cell and humoral immune responses. Despite these observed defects, the still high antibody titers were sufficient to confer protection towards lethal viral challenges.

Including such features would improve benchmarking studies and accelerate the development of methods for genetic analysis. Here, we describe GEPSi (GWAS Epistatic Phenotype Simulator), a user-friendly python package to simulate phenotype data based on user-supplied genotype data for a population.

Fentanyl use among women has increased substantially in the last decade, leading to a 40-fold increase in the number of perinatally-exposed infants. This exposure can result in neuropsychiatric abnormalities that persist into adolescence and, in some cases, adulthood. We previously developed a preclinical model to establish the consequences of perinatal fentanyl exposure and identified a pattern of synaptic pathophysiology that involves lasting impairments in primary somatosensory (S1) circuit function and behavior. Here, we ask if these long-lasting effects can be restored by a non-invasive intervention. We demonstrate that developmental exposure to environmental enrichment ameliorates many of fentanyl’s deleterious behavioral effects, including hyperactivity, enhanced sensitivity to anxiogenic environments, and sensory maladaptation. As an extension of our past work, we found that perinatal fentanyl alters the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and impairs long-term potentiation in S1 layer 2/3 neurons. These deficits in synaptic function were restored by environmental enrichment. Environmental enrichment also affected neurons in control mice, reducing long-term potentiation and depression, and increasing frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. These results demonstrate that the lasting somatosensory-related effects of fentanyl can be ameliorated with a non-invasive intervention introduced during early development.

Stieglitz'}, {'name': 'K.A. Potts'}, {'name': 'J.A. Van Deventer'}]","<p>Genetic code expansion is a powerful approach for advancing critical fields such as biological therapeutic discovery. However, the machinery for genetically encoding noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) is only available in limited plasmid formats, constraining potential applications. In extreme cases, the introduction of two separate plasmids, one containing an orthogonal translation system (OTS) to facilitate ncAA incorporation and a second for expressing a ncAA-containing protein of interest, is not possible due to lack of convenient selection markers. One strategy to circumvent this challenge is to express the OTS and protein of interest from a single vector. For what we believe is the first time in yeast, we describe here several sets of single plasmid systems (SPSs) for performing genetic code manipulation and compare the ncAA incorporation capabilities of these plasmids against the capabilities of previously described dual plasmid systems (DPSs). For both dual fluorescent protein reporters and yeast display reporters tested with multiple OTSs and ncAAs, measured ncAA incorporation efficiencies with SPSs were determined to be equal to or improved relative to efficiencies determined with DPSs. Click chemistry on yeast cells displaying ncAA-containing proteins was also shown to be feasible in both formats, although differences in reactivity between formats suggest the need for caution when using such approaches. Additionally, we investigated whether these reporters would support separation of yeast strains known to exhibit distinct ncAA incorporation efficiencies. Model sorts conducted with mixtures of two strains transformed with the same SPS or DPS led to enrichment of a strain known to support higher efficiency ncAA incorporation, suggesting that these reporters will be suitable for conducting screens for strains exhibiting enhanced ncAA incorporation efficiencies. Overall, our results confirm that SPSs are well-behaved in yeast and provide a convenient alternative to DPSs. In particular, SPSs are expected to be invaluable for conducting high-throughput investigations of the effects of genetic or genomic changes on ncAA incorporation efficiency and, more fundamentally, the eukaryotic translation apparatus.</p><sec><title>Abstract Figure</title><fig id=""ufig1"" position=""float"" fig-type=""figure"" orientation=""portrait""><graphic xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""454837v1_ufig1"" position=""float"" orientation=""portrait"" /></fig></sec>",2021-08-03

An understanding of how these policies impacted travel patterns over time and at different spatial scales is important for designing effective strategies, future pandemic planning and in providing broader insights on the population geography of the country. Crowd level data on mobile phone usage can be used as a proxy for population mobility patterns and provide a way of quantifying in near-real time the impact of social distancing measures on changes in mobility. Here we explore patterns of change in densities, domestic and international flows and co-location of Facebook users in the UK from March 2020 to March 2021. We find substantial heterogeneities across time and region, with large changes observed compared to pre-pandemic patterns. The impacts of periods of lockdown on distances travelled and flow volumes are evident, with each showing variations, but some significant reductions in co-location rates. Clear differences in multiple metrics of mobility are seen in central London compared to the rest of the UK, with each of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland showing significant deviations from England at times. Moreover, the impacts of rapid changes in rules on international travel to and from the UK are seen in substantial fluctuations in traveller volumes by destination. While questions remain about the representativeness of the Facebook data, previous studies have shown strong correspondence with census-based data and alternative mobility measures, suggesting that findings here are valuable for guiding strategies.</p>",2021-08-04

McNickle'}]","<p>In plants, most competition is resource competition, where one plant simply pre-empts the resources away from its neighbours. Interference competition, as the name implies, is a form of direct interference to prevent resource access. Interference competition is common among animals who can physically fight, but in plants, one of the main mechanisms of interference competition is Allelopathy. allelopathic plants release of cytotoxic chemicals into the environment which can increase their ability to compete with surrounding organisms for limited resources. The circumstances and conditions favoring the development and maintenance of allelochemicals, however, is not well understood. Particularly, it seems strange that, despite the obvious benefits of allelopathy, it seems to have only rarely evolved. To gain insight into the cost and benefit of allelopathy, we have developed a 2 × 2 matrix game to model the interaction between plants that produce allelochemicals and plants that do not. Production of an allelochemical introduces novel cost associated with synthesis and detoxifying a toxic chemical but may also convey a competitive advantage. A plant that does not produce an allelochemical will suffer the cost of encountering one. Our model predicts three cases in which the evolutionarily stable strategies are different. In the first, the non-allelopathic plant is a stronger competitor, and not producing allelochemicals is the evolutionarily stable strategy. In the second, the allelopathic plant is the better competitor and production of allelochemicals is the more beneficial strategy. In the last case, neither is the evolutionarily stable strategy. Instead, there are alternating stable states, depending on whether the allelopathic or non-allelopathic plant arrived first. The generated model reveals circumstances leading to the evolution of allelochemicals and sheds light on utilizing allelochemicals as part of weed management strategies. In particular, the wide region of alternative stable states in most parameterizations, combined with the fact that the absence of allelopathy is likely the ancestral state, provides an elegant answer to the question of why allelopathy rarely evolves despite its obvious benefits. Allelopathic plants can indeed outcompete non-allelopathic plants, but this benefit is simply not great enough to allow them to go to fixation and spread through the population. Thus, most populations would remain purely non-allelopathic.</p>",2021-08-05

Motor Neuron and Pancreas Homeobox 1 (MNX1) has long been recognized as a key marker of the MN lineage. Deficiency of the Mnx1 gene in mice results in early postnatal lethality - likely by causing abnormal MN development and respiratory malfunction. However, the genome-wide targets and exact regulatory function of Mnx1 in MNs remains unresolved. Using an in vitro model for efficient MN induction from mouse embryonic stem cells, we identified about six thousand MNX1-bound loci, of which half are conserved enhancers co-bound by the core MN-inducing factors ISL1 and LHX3, while the other half are promoters for housekeeping-like genes. Despite its widespread binding, disruption of Mnx1 affects the activity of only a few dozen MNX1-bound loci, and causes mis-regulation of about one hundred genes, the majority of which are up-regulated pan-neuronal genes with relatively higher expression in the brain compared to MNs. Integration of genome-wide binding, transcriptomic and epigenomic data in the wild-type and Mnx1-disrupted MNs predicts that Pbx3 and Pou6f2 are two putative direct targets of MNX1, and both are homeobox transcription factors highly expressed in the central nervous system. Our results suggest that MNX1 is crucial for restraining the expression of many pan-neuronal genes in MNs, likely in an indirect fashion. Further, the rarity of direct targets in contrast to the widespread binding of MNX1 reflects a distinctive mode of transcriptional regulation by homeobox transcriptional factors.</p>",2021-08-07

While the reliance of plants on their microbial inhabitants for defense against invading pathogens is well documented, the acquisition of data concerning the relationships between plant developmental stage or aging, and microbiome assembly, is still underway. In this work, we observed developmental-age dependent changes in the phyllopshere microbiome of tomato. The plant hormone cytokinin (CK) regulates various plant growth and developmental processes. Here, we show that age-related shifts in microbiome content vary based on content of, or sensitivity to, CK. We observed a developmental age associated decline in microbial richness and diversity, accompanied by a decline in the presence of growth promoting and resistance inducing bacilli in the phyllosphere. This decline was absent from CK-rich or CK-hypersensitive genotypes. Bacillus isolates we obtained from CK rich genotypes were found to re-program the transcriptome to support morphogenesis and alter the leaf developmental program when applied to seedlings, and enhance yield and agricultural productivity when applied to mature plants. Our results support the notion that CK-dependent effects on microbiome content support developmental functions, suggesting that these are mediated by CK in part via the bacterial community.</p>",2021-08-02

We examined these interactions in the murine mammary gland. Luminal and myoepithelial subpopulations of the postnatal mammary gland arise from unipotent progenitors, but the destiny of cap cells, which enclose terminal end buds (TEB) in pubertal mice, remains controversial. Using a transgenic strain (Tg11.5kb-GFP) that specifically marks cap cells, we found ~50% of these cells undergo divisions perpendicular to the TEB surface, suggesting they might contribute to the underlying luminal cell population. To address their stemness potential we developed a lineage tracing mouse driven from the s-SHIP (11.5 kb) promoter. Induction of tdTomato (tdTom) from this promoter in vivo demonstrated that all cap cell progeny are myoepithelial, with no conversion to luminal lineage. Organoid cultures also exhibited unipotency. However, isolated cap cells cultured as mammospheres generated mixed luminal/myoepithelial spheres. Moreover, ablation of luminal cells in vivo using diphtheria toxin triggered repopulation by progeny of tdTom+ cap cells. A signaling inhibitor screen identified the TGFb pathway as a potential regulator of multipotency. TGFbR inhibitors or gene deletion blocked conversion to the luminal lineage, consistent with an autocrine loop in which cap cells secrete TGFb to activate the receptor and promote luminal transdifferentiation. Ductal tree regeneration in vivo from isolated cap cells was much more efficient when they were pre-treated with inhibitor, consistent with more cells retaining cap cell potential prior to transplantation. Notably, in vitro transdifferentiation of cap cells was blocked by co-culture with luminal cells. Overall, these data reveal a self-limiting cell circuit through which mammary luminal cells suppress cap cell conversion to the luminal lineage.</p>",2021-08-05

Brozak'}, {'name': 'Binod Pant'}, {'name': 'Salman Safdar'}, {'name': 'Abba B. Gumel'}]","<p>India has been the latest global epicenter for COVID-19, a novel coronavirus disease that emerged in China in late 2019. We present a base mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in India and its neighbor, Pakistan. The base model, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, is parameterized using cumulative COVID-19 mortality data from each of the two countries. The model was used to assess the population-level impact of the control and mitigation strategies implemented in the two countries (notably community lockdowns, use of face masks, and social-distancing). Numerical simulations of the basic model indicate that, based on the current baseline levels of the control and mitigation strategies implemented, the pandemic trajectory in India is on a downward trend (as characterized by the reproduction number of the disease dynamics in India below, but close to, unity). This downward trend will be reversed, and India will be recording mild outbreaks (i.e., pandemic waves), if the control and mitigation strategies are relaxed from their current levels (e.g., relaxed to the extent that the associated community transmission parameters are increased by 20% or 40% from their current baseline values). Our simulations suggest that India could record up to 460,000 cumulative deaths by early September 2021 under the baseline levels of the control strategies implemented (up to 25,000 of the projected deaths could be averted if the control and mitigation measures are strengthened to the extent that the associated community transmission parameters are reduced by 20% from their baseline values). Our simulations show that the pandemic in Pakistan is much milder, with an estimated projected cumulative mortality of about 24,000 by early September 2021 under the baseline scenario. The basic model was extended to assess the impact of back-and-forth mobility between the two countries. Simulations of the resulting metapopulation model, which uses a Lagrangian mobility framework (based on residence-time spent in each country), shows that the burden of the pandemic in Pakistan increases with increasing values of the average time residents of India spend in Pakistan. In particular, it is shown that the India-to-Pakistan mobility pattern may trigger a significant fourth wave of the pandemic in Pakistan (under certain mobility scenarios and mitigation levels), with daily mortality peaking in mid-August to mid-September of 2021. It is also shown that extending the current travel restrictions by at least three months would significantly enhance the prospect of eliminating the pandemic in both countries. On the other hand, it is shown that, in addition to causing future multiple waves of the pandemic, easing the current levels of control and mitigation measures in the two countries (including travel restrictions) would result in delaying pandemic elimination in India and Pakistan to November and July 2022, respectively.</p>",2021-08-05
