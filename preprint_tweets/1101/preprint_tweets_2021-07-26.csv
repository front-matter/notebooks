Without specific antivirals, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to cause major global mortality. Antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine (CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and mefloquine have emerged as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. CQ/HCQ entered the Solidarity and RECOVERY clinical trials against COVID-19 and showed lack of efficacy. Importantly, mefloquine is not a 4-aminoquinoline like CQ and HCQ and has been previously repurposed for other respiratory diseases. Unlike the 4-aminoquinolines that accumulate in the high pH of intracellular lysosomes of the lung, the high respiratory tract penetration of mefloquine is driven by its high lipophilicity. While CQ and HCQ exhibit activity in Vero E6 cells, their activity is obviated in TMPRSS2-expressing cells, such as Calu-3 cells, which more accurately recapitulate in vivo entry mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, here we report the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of mefloquine in Calu-3 type II pneumocytes and primary human monocytes. Mefloquine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells with low cytotoxicity and EC<sub>50</sub> and EC<sub>90</sub> values of 1.2 and 5.3 µM, respectively. In addition, mefloquine reduced up to 68% the SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in infected monocytes, reducing viral-induced inflammation. Mefloquine blocked early steps of the SARS-CoV-2 replicative cycle and was less prone than CQ to induce drug-associated viral mutations and synergized with RNA polymerase inhibitor. The pharmacological parameters of mefloquine are consistent with its plasma exposure in humans and its tissue-to-plasma predicted coefficient points that this drug may accumulate in the lungs. These data indicate that mefloquine could represent an orally available clinically approved drug option against COVID-19 and should not be neglected on the basis of the failure of CQ and HCQ.</p>",2021-07-21

New'}, {'name': 'Iñaki Ruiz-Trillo'}]","<p>Significant increases in sedimentation rate accompany the evolution of multicellularity. These increases should lead to rapid changes in ecological distribution, thereby affecting the costs and benefits of multicellularity and its likelihood to evolve. However, how genetic and cellular traits which control this process, their likelihood of emergence over evolutionary timescales, and the variation in these traits as multicellularity evolves, are still poorly understood. Here, using isolates of the ichthyosporean <italic>Sphaeroforma</italic> genus - close unicellular relatives of animals with brief transient multicellular life stages - we demonstrate that sedimentation rate is a highly variable and evolvable trait affected by at least two distinct physical mechanisms. We first find a dramatic &gt;300x variation in sedimentation rate for different <italic>Sphaeroforma</italic> species, mainly driven by size and density during the unicellular-to-multicellular life cycle transition. Using experimental evolution with sedimentation rate as a focal trait, we readily obtained fast settling <italic>S. arctica</italic> isolates. Quantitative microscopy showed that increased sedimentation rates most often arose by incomplete cellular separation after cell division, leading to clonal “clumping” multicellular variants with increased size and density. Additionally, density increases arose by an acceleration of the nuclear doubling time relative to cell size. Similar size- and density-affecting phenotypes were observed in four additional species from the <italic>Sphaeroforma</italic> genus, suggesting variation in these traits might be widespread in the marine habitat. By sequencing evolved isolates, we identified mutations in regulators of cytokinesis, plasma membrane remodelling, and chromatin condensation that may contribute to both clump formation and the increase in the nuclear number-to-volume ratio. Taken together, this study illustrates how extensive cellular control of density and size drive sedimentation rate variation, likely shaping the evolution of multicellularity.</p>",2021-07-23

Whether this involves direct control of movement, or reflects a cognitive process underlying movement, has remained unresolved. Here we find that strong, opponent control of behavior by the two pathways of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) depends on a task's cognitive demands. Furthermore, a latent state model (a hidden markov model with generalized linear model observations) reveals that - even within a single task - the contribution of the two pathways to behavior is state-dependent. Specifically, the two pathways have large contributions in one of two states associated with a strategy of evidence accumulation, compared to a state associated with a strategy of repeating previous choices. Thus, both the cognitive demands imposed by a task, as well as the strategy that mice pursue within a task, determine whether DMS pathways provide strong and opponent control of behavior.</p>",2021-07-25

Despite a remarkable fossil record, the emergence of their crown group is documented by few specimens of unclear affinities, rendering much of their early history uncertain. The origin of sand dollars, one of its most distinctive clades, is also unclear due to an unstable phylogenetic context and discrepancies between molecular divergence times and fossil evidence. We employ seventeen novel genomes and transcriptomes to build a phylogenomic dataset with a near-complete sampling of major lineages. With it, we revise the phylogeny and divergence times of echinoids, and place their history within the broader context of echinoderm evolution. We also introduce the concept of a chronospace - a multidimensional representation of node ages - and use it to explore the effects of using alternative gene samples, models of molecular evolution, and clock priors. We find the choice of clock model to have the strongest impact on divergence times, while the use of site-heterogeneous models shows little effects. The choice of loci shows an intermediate impact, affecting mostly deep Paleozoic nodes, for which clock-like genes recover dates more congruent with fossil evidence. Our results reveal that crown group echinoids originated in the Permian and diversified rapidly in the Triassic, despite the relative lack of fossil evidence for this early diversification. We also clarify the relationships among sand dollars and their close relatives, showing that the genus Apatopygus represents a relict lineage with a deep Jurassic origin. Surprisingly, the origin of sand dollars is confidently dated to the Cretaceous, implying ghost ranges spanning approximately 50 million years, a remarkable discrepancy with their rich fossil record.</p>",2021-07-20

Generation of anti-RBD IgG was dependent upon spike-specific T follicular helper (Tfh) CD4+ T cells, which acted as limiting checkpoint. Tfh generation was impeded by high dose mycophenolate mofetil in non-responders to vaccine but not in infected patients, suggesting that increasing immunogenicity of vaccine could improve response rate to mRNA vaccine.

In the autoinhibited state, this module adopts a conformation which stabilizes an inactive conformation of the kinase domain. The binding of the tSH2 module to doubly-phosphorylated tyrosine-containing motifs necessitates a conformational change, thereby relieving kinase inhibition and promoting activation. We determined the crystal structure of the isolated tSH2 module of Syk and find, in contrast to ZAP-70, that its conformation more closely resembles that of the peptide-bound state, rather than the autoinhibited state. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange by mass spectrometry, as well as molecular dynamics simulations, reveal that the dynamics of the tSH2 modules of Syk and ZAP-70 differ, with most of these differences occurring in the C-terminal SH2 domain. Our data suggest that the conformational landscapes of the tSH2 modules in Syk and ZAP-70 have been tuned differently, such that the auto-inhibited conformation of the Syk tSH2 module is less stable. This feature of Syk likely contributes to its ability to more readily escape autoinhibition when compared to ZAP-70, consistent with tighter control of downstream signaling pathways in T cells.</p>",2021-07-20

We used an interdisciplinary approach to quantify how these interacting dynamics can lead to the evolution of multi-drug resistant bacteria. We co-cultured two strains of Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, each harbouring a different antibiotic resistance gene, with 80α generalized transducing phage. After a growth phase of 8h, bacteria and phage surprisingly coexisted at a stable equilibrium in our culture, the level of which was dependent on the starting concentration of phage. We detected double-resistant bacteria as early as 7h, indicating that transduction of AMR genes had occurred. We developed multiple mathematical models of the bacteria and phage relationship, and found that phage-bacteria dynamics were best captured by a model in which the phage burst size decreases as the bacteria population reaches stationary phase, and where phage predation is frequency-dependent. We estimated that one in every 10<sup>8</sup> new phage generated was a transducing phage carrying an AMR gene, and that double-resistant bacteria were always predominantly generated by transduction rather than by growth. Our results suggest a fundamental shift in how we understand and model phage-bacteria dynamics. Although rates of generalised transduction may seem insignificant, they are sufficient to consistently lead to the evolution of multi-drug resistant bacteria. Currently, the potential of phage to contribute to the growing burden of AMR is likely underestimated.</p>",2021-07-24

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are potent gastric acid suppressing medications. Whether PPI use vs non-use is associated with severe Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outcomes remains uncertain. We aimed to compare severe COVID-19 outcomes between current outpatient PPI users and non-users.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective propensity score-weighted analysis of a national cohort of US veterans with established care who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) through January 9, 2021, and who had 60 days of follow-up. The positive test date was the index date. Current outpatient PPI use up to and including the index date (primary exposure) was compared to non-use, defined as no PPI prescription fill in the 365 days prior to the index date. The primary outcome was a composite of use of mechanical ventilation or death within 60 days.

Here we investigate human and animal contacts and human health in a community living around the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP), Uganda. We used contact and health survey data to identify opportunities for cross-species pathogen transmission, focusing mostly on people and the endangered mountain gorilla. We conducted a survey with background questions and self-reported diaries to investigate 100 participants’ health, such as symptoms and behaviours, and contact patterns, including direct contacts and sightings over a week. Contacts were revealed through networks, including humans, domestic, peri-domestic, and wild animals for 1) network of contacts seen in the week of background questionnaire completion, 2) network of contacts seen during the diary week. Participants frequently felt unwell during the study, reporting from one to 10 disease symptoms at different intensity levels (maximum of seven symptoms in one day), with severe symptoms comprising 6.4% of the diary records and tiredness and headaches the most common symptoms. Besides human-human contacts, direct contacts with livestock and peri-domestic animals were the most common. Wildlife contacts were the rarest, including one direct contact with gorilla with a concerning timeline of reported symptoms. The contact networks were moderately connected and revealing a preference in contacts within the same species or taxon and within their groups. Despite sightings of wildlife being much more common than touching, one participant declared direct contact with a mountain gorilla during the week. Gorillas were seen very close to six animal taxa (including themselves) considering all interaction types, mostly seen closer to other gorillas, but also people and domestic animals. Our findings reveal a local human population with recurrent symptoms of illness in a location with intense exposure to factors that can increase pathogen transmission, such as direct contact with domestic and wild animals and proximity among animal species.

Using an EdU cell proliferation assay, we found that a global increase in cell proliferation is not visible before 12h into wound healing. Hence, the initial stages to cover the injury site including cell transdifferentiation and migration seem to be executed by cells remaining after injury. Gene expression clustering coupled with GO term enrichment analysis confirmed that expression of genes involved in processes related to cell proliferation, DNA repair as well as apoptotic processes at 3 and 6h of wound healing was not upregulated.

In order to address possible explanations for these contradictions we examined trait-trait variations of 11 genomic traits from ∼ 17,000 sequenced genomes. The studied trait-trait variations suggested: (i) the predominance of two resistance and resilience-related orthogonal axes, (ii) an overlap between a resilience axis and an axis of resource usage efficiency. These findings imply that resistance associated traits of prokaryotes are globally decoupled from resilience and resource use efficiencies associated traits. However, further inspection of pairwise scatterplots showed that resistance and resilience traits tended to be positively related for genomes up to roughly five million base pairs and negatively for larger genomes. This in turn precludes a globally consistent assignment of prokaryote genomic traits to the competitor - stress-tolerator -ruderal (CSR) schema that sorts species depending on their location along disturbance and productivity gradients into three ecological strategies and may serve as an explanation for conflicting findings from earlier studies. All reviewed genomic traits featured significant phylogenetic signals and we propose that our trait table can be applied to extrapolate genomic traits from taxonomic marker genes. This will enable to empirically evaluate the assembly of these genomic traits in prokaryotic communities from different habitats and under different productivity and disturbance scenarios as predicted via the resistance-resilience framework formulated here.</p>",2021-07-24

Here, we compare tumor progression of ER+ and triple-negative (TN) BC subtypes with a clinically relevant mouse intraductal  xenografting approach (MIND). Both ER+ and TN BC cells disseminate already during the in situstage. However, TN disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) proliferate at the same rate as cells at the primary site and give rise to macro-metastases. ER+ DTCs have low proliferative indices, form only micro-metastases and lose epithelial characteristics. Expression of CDH1 is decreased whereas the mesenchymal marker VIM and the transcription factors, ZEB1/ZEB2, which control epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) are increased. EMP is not detected earlier during ER+ BC development and not required for invasion or metastasis. In vivo, forced transition to the epithelial state through ectopic E-cadherin expression overcomes dormancy with increased growth of lung metastases.

Here, we present a method, Psix, to confidently identify splicing that changes across a landscape of single cells, using a probabilistic model that is robust against the data limitations of scRNA-seq. Its autocorrelation-inspired approach finds patterns of alternative splicing that correspond to patterns of cell identity, such as cell type or developmental stage, without the need for explicit cell clustering, labeling, or trajectory inference. Applying Psix to data that follow the trajectory of mouse brain development, we identify exons whose alternative splicing patterns cluster into modules of co-regulation. We show that the exons in these modules are enriched for binding by distinct neuronal splicing factors, and that their changes in splicing correspond to changes in expression of these splicing factors. Thus, Psix reveals cell-type-dependent splicing patterns and the wiring of the splicing regulatory networks that control them.

We found that, in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster larval neuroblasts, the frequency of Chromosome Breaks (CBs), induced by acute γ-radiation, is significantly reduced when flies are previously exposed to a protracted dose of 0.4 Gy delivered at a dose rate of 2.5 mGy/h. This indicates that this exposure, which is associated with an increased expression of DNA damage response proteins, induces a radioadaptive response (RAR) that protects Drosophila from extensive DNA damage. Interestingly, the same exposure reduces the frequency of telomere fusions (TFs) from Drosophila telomere capping mutants suggesting that the LDDR can generally promote a protective response on chromatin sites that are recognized as DNA breaks. Deep RNA sequencing revealed that RAR is associated with a modulation of genes involved in RNA processing and the reduction of expression of Loquacious D (Loqs-RD) gene that encodes a well-conserved dsRNA binding protein required for esiRNAs biogenesis. Remarkably, loss of Loqs mimics the LDDR-mediated chromosome protection as it decreases the IR-induced CBs and TF frequency.

Here, the aerosol concentration is reduced by natural ventilation. In this context, we are investigating the effect of large mobile air purifiers (AP) with HEPA filters on particle concentration and their suitability for classroom use in a primary school in Germany. The three tested APs differ significantly in their air outlet characteristics. Measurements of the number of particles, the particle size distribution, and the CO2 concentration were carried out in the classroom with students (April/May 2021) and with an aerosol generator without students. In this regard, the use of APs leads to a substantial reduction in aerosol particles. At the same time, the three APs are found to have differences in their particle decay rate, noise level, and flow velocity. In addition to the measurements, the effect of various influencing parameters on the potential inhaled particle dose was investigated using a calculation model. The parameters considered include the duration of stay, particle concentration in exhaled air, respiratory flow rate, virus lifetime, ventilation interval, ventilation efficiency, AP volumetric flow, as well as room size. Based on the resulting effect diagrams, significant recommendations can be derived for reducing the risk of infection from virus-laden aerosols. Finally, the measurements were compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, as such tools can aid the optimal placement and configuration of APs and can be used to study the effect of the spread of aerosols from a source in the classroom.</p>",2021-07-26

We introduce a general Bayesian framework to relax the assumption of independent divergences during phylogenetic inference, and test for patterns predicted by processes of diversification that affect multiple evolutionary lineages. Using simulations, we find our new method accurately infers shared divergence events when they occur, and performs as well as current methods when divergnces are independent.

One such factor frequently mutated, is the tumor suppressor PTEN. These tumors are supposed to be more resistant to radiation, chemo- and immunotherapy. Methods: Using CRISPR genome editing, we deleted PTEN in a human tracheal stem cell-like cell line as well generated primary murine NSCLC, proficient or deficient for Pten, in vivo. These models were used to verify the impact of PTEN loss in vitro and in vivo by immunohistochemical staining, western blot and RNA-Sequencing. Radiation sensitivity was assessed by colony formation and growth assays. To elucidate putative treatment options, identified via the molecular characterisation, PTEN pro- and deficient cells were treated with PI3K/mTOR/DNA-PK-inhibitor PI-103 or the ATM-inhibitors KU-60019 und AZD 1390. Changes in radiation sensitivity were assessed by colony-formation assay, FACS, western-blot, phospho-proteomic mass spectrometry and ex vivo lung slice cultures. Results: We demonstrate that loss of PTEN led to altered expression of transcriptional programs which directly regulate therapy resistance, resulting in establishment of radiation resistance. While PTEN-deficient tumor cells were not dependent on DNA PK for IR resistance nor activated ATR during IR, they showed a significant dependence for the DNA damage kinase ATM. Pharmacologic inhibition of ATM, via KU-60019 and AZD1390 at non-toxic doses, restored and even synergized with IR in PTEN-deficient human and murine NSCLC cells as well in a multicellular organotypic ex vivo tumor model. Conclusion: PTEN tumors are addicted to ATM to detect and repair radiation induced DNA damage. This creates an exploitable bottleneck. At least in cellulo and ex vivo we show that low concentration of ATM inhibitor is able to synergise with IR to treat PTEN-deficient tumors in genetically well-defined IR resistant lung cancer models.</p>",2021-07-25

A limitation of existing causal learning methods is that they cannot identify indirect causal relations, those that would interact through latent mediating variables. We developed the first computational method that identifies both direct and indirect causalities, causal inference using deep-learning variable-selection (causalDeepVASE). To accurately identify indirect causalities and incorporate them with direct causalities, causalDeepVASE develops a deep neural network approach and extends a flexible causal inference method. In simulated and biological data of various contexts, causalDeepVASE outperforms existing methods in identifying expected or validated causal relations. Further, causalDeepVASE facilitates a systematic understanding of complex diseases. For example, causalDeepVASE uniquely identified a possible causal relation between IFNγ and creatinine suggested in a polymicrobial sepsis model. In future biomedical studies, causalDeepVASE can facilitate the identification of driver genes and therapeutic agents.</p>",2021-07-19

Here, we develop a novel image segmentation pipeline based on deep learning that considerably outperforms classical (i.e. non-deep learning) segmentation methods, and use this to extract accurate information on whole-body plumage colouration from photographs of &gt;24,000 museum specimens covering &gt;4,500 species of passerine birds. Our results demonstrate that UV reflectance, particularly as a component of other colours, is widespread across the passerine radiation but is strongly phylogenetically conserved. We also find clear evidence in support of the role of light environment in promoting the evolution of UV plumage colouration, and a weak trend towards higher UV plumage reflectance among bird species with ultraviolet rather than violet-sensitive visual systems. Overall, our study provides important broad-scale insight into an enigmatic component of avian colouration, as well as demonstrating that deep learning has considerable promise for allowing new data to be bought to bare on long-standing questions in ecology and evolution.</p>",2021-07-26

To identify and evaluate the evidence of the most relevant running-related risk factors (RRRFs) for running-related overuse injuries (ROIs) and to suggest future research directions.

Design
Systematic review considering prospective and retrospective studies. (PROSPERO_ID: 236832)

Data sources
Pubmed. Connected Papers. The search was performed in February 2021. 

Eligibility criteria
English language. Studies on participants whose primary sport is running addressing the risk for the seven most common ROIs and at least one kinematic, kinetic (including pressure measurements), or electromyographic RRRF. An RRRF needed to be identified in at least one prospective or two retrospective studies. 

Results 
Sixty-two articles fulfilled our eligibility criteria. Levels of evidence for specific ROIs ranged from conflicting to moderate evidence. Running populations and methods applied varied considerably between studies. While some RRRFs appeared for several ROIs, most RRRFs were specific for a particular ROI. The biomechanical measurements performed in many studies would have allowed for consideration of many more RRRFs than have been reported, highlighting a potential for more effective data usage in the future.

Conclusion
This study offers a comprehensive overview of RRRFs for the most common ROIs, which might serve as a starting point to develop ROI-specific risk profiles of individual runners. Future work should use macroscopic (big data) approaches involving long-term data collections in the real world and microscopic approaches involving precise stress calculations using recent developments in biomechanical modelling. However, consensus on data collection standards (including the quantification of workload and stress tolerance variables and the reporting of injuries) is warranted.</p>",2021-07-26

Kushner'}, {'name': 'Henning Tiemeier'}, {'name': 'Fernando Rivadeneira'}, {'name': 'Vincent W. V. Jaddoe'}, {'name': 'Wiro Niessen'}, {'name': 'Eppo B. Wolvius'}, {'name': 'Gennady V. Roshchupkin'}]","<p>IMPORTANCE: Children exposed to a high level of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) are more likely to develop fetal alcohol spectrum disorder with adverse phenotypes on their faces. However, it is still poorly understood, which level of PAE is associated with facial manifestation and if such associations persist during childhood. 
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between PAE and children facial phenotype in a prospective multi-ethnic population-based study.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was based on the Generation R Study, a prospective cohort from fetal life onwards with maternal and offspring data. Children had a 3D facial image taken at ages 9 (n=3160) and 13 years (n=2492). 
EXPOSURES: We defined 6 levels of PAE based on the frequency and dose of alcohol consumption, and defined three tiers based on the timing of alcohol exposure of the unborn child.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:  For image analysis, we used 3D graph convolutional networks for non-linear dimensionality reduction, which compressed the high-dimensional images into 200 endophenotypes representing facial morphology. These facial endophenotypes were used as dependent variables in a linear regression analysis to search for associations with PAE. Finally, to detect specific facial components associated with PAE, we mapped statistically significant endophenotypes back to the 3D facial shape. We generated heatmaps to display the facial changes associated with PAE. PAE prediction based on facial shape was also performed; the prediction accuracy was estimated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
RESULTS: A significant association between PAE and facial shape was found in the 9-year-old children, at all levels of alcohol exposure: the higher the level of exposure, the stronger the association. Moreover, PAE before and during pregnancy was associated with facial shape. The most common detected facial phenotypes included turned-up nose tip, shortened nose, turned-out jaw and turned-in lower-eyelid-related regions. For the 13-year-old children, the associations were weaker and the AUCs lower than those of the 9-years-old children.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: PAE before and during pregnancy, even at low level, is associated with the facial shape of children, and these associations become weaker as children grow older.</p>",2021-07-25

A quantitative understanding of the key processes driving EBOV assembly and budding could provide valuable insights to inform drug development. Here we used a computational model to evaluate EBOV matrix assembly. Our model focused on the assembly kinetics of VP40, the matrix protein in EBOV, and its interaction with phosphatidylserine (PS) in the host cell membrane. Human cells transfected with VP40-expressing plasmids are capable of producing virus-like particles (VLPs) that closely resemble EBOV virions. We used data from this in vitro VP40 system to calibrate our computational model. PS levels in the host cell membrane had been shown to affect VP40 dynamics as well as VLP production through recruiting VP40 dimers to plasma membrane inner leaflet. Our computational results indicated that PS may have direct influence on VP40 filament growth and affect multiple steps in the assembly and budding of VP40 VLPs. We also proposed that the assembly of VP40 filaments may follow the nucleation-elongation theory where initialization and oligomerization of VP40 are two separate and distinct steps in the assembly process. This work illustrated how computational and experimental approaches can be combined to allow for additional analysis and hypothesis generation. Our findings advanced understanding of the molecular process of EBOV assembly and budding processes and may help the development of new EBOV treatments targeting VP40 matrix assembly.</p>",2021-07-25

There is a plethora of different computational tools that process the raw MS data and derive peptide and protein identification and quantification. During the last decade, there has been dramatic progress in computer science and software engineering, including collaboration tools that have transformed research and industry. To leverage these advances, we developed AlphaPept, a Python-based open-source framework for efficient processing of large high-resolution MS data sets. Using Numba for just-in-time machine code compilation on CPU and GPU, we achieve hundred-fold speed improvements while maintaining clear syntax and rapid development speed. AlphaPept uses the Python scientific stack of highly optimized packages, reducing the code base to domain-specific tasks while providing access to the latest advances in machine learning. We provide an easy on-ramp for community validation and contributions through the concept of literate programming, implemented in Jupyter Notebooks of the different modules. A framework for continuous integration, testing, and benchmarking enforces solid software engineering principles. Large datasets can rapidly be processed as shown by the analysis of hundreds of cellular proteomes in minutes per file, many-fold faster than the data acquisiton. The AlphaPept framework can be used to build automated processing pipelines using efficient HDF5 based file formats, web-serving functionality and compatibility with downstream analysis tools. Easy access for end-users is provided by one-click installation of the graphical user interface, for advanced users via a modular Python library, and for developers via a fully open GitHub repository.</p>",2021-07-26

At the core of the NPC is a permeability barrier consisting of intrinsically disordered Phe-Gly (FG) nucleoporins (FG Nups). Various types of nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) facilitate transport by partitioning in the FG Nup assembly, overcoming the barrier by their affinity to the FG Nups, and comprise a significant fraction of proteins in the NPC barrier. In previous work, we revealed that the experimental binding of the NTRs NTF2 and -- the larger -- Impβ to different planar assemblies of FG Nups follows a universal physical law defined by negative cooperativity, which was further validated by a minimal physical model that treated the FG Nups as flexible homopolymers and the NTRs as uniformly cohesive spheres Zahn et al. (2016). Here, we build upon our original study by first parametrizing our model to experimental data, and next to predict the effects of crowding by different types of NTRs. We show how varying the amounts of one type of NTR modulates how the other NTR penetrates the FG Nup assembly. Notably, at similar and physiologically relevant NTR concentrations, our model predicts demixed phases of NTF2 and Impβ within the FG Nup assembly. The functional implication of NTR phase separation is that NPCs may sustain separate transport pathways that are determined by inter-NTR competition.</p>",2021-07-26
