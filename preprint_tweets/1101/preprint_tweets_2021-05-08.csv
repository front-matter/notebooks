Here, we show that aminoglycosides, a well-known class of antibiotics produced by <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, are potent inhibitors of phage infection in widely divergent bacterial hosts. We demonstrate that aminoglycosides block an early step of the viral life cycle, prior to genome replication. Phage inhibition was also achieved using supernatants from natural aminoglycoside producers, hinting at a broad physiological significance of the antiviral properties of aminoglycosides. Strikingly, we show that acetylation of the aminoglycoside antibiotic apramycin abolishes its antibacterial effect, but retains its antiviral properties. Altogether, this study expands the knowledge of potential aminoglycoside functions in bacterial communities suggesting that aminoglycosides are not only used by their producers as toxic molecules against their bacterial competitors, but could also provide protection against the threat of phage predation at the community level.</p>",2021-05-02

Sherman","<p>Cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) heterogeneity is increasingly appreciated, but the origins and functions of distinct CAF subtypes remain poorly understood. The abundant and transcriptionally diverse CAF population in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is thought to arise from a common cell of origin, pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), with diversification resulting from cytokine and growth factor gradients within the tumor microenvironment. Here we analyzed the differentiation and function of PSCs during tumor progression <italic>in vivo</italic>. Contrary to expectations, we found that PSCs give rise to a numerically minor subset of PDAC CAFs. Targeted ablation of PSC-derived CAFs within their host tissue revealed non-redundant functions for this defined CAF population in shaping the PDAC microenvironment, including production of specific components of the extracellular matrix. Together, these findings link stromal evolution from distinct cells of origin to transcriptional heterogeneity among PDAC CAFs, and demonstrate unique functions for CAFs of a defined cellular origin.</p><sec><title>Statement of significance</title><p>By tracking and ablating a specific CAF population, we find that a numerically minor CAF subtype from a defined cell of origin plays unique roles in establishing the pancreatic tumor microenvironment.

Rode, Pauline Buffard, Kazuki Nosho, Miriam Bayer, Hannah Jeckel, Eric Jelli, Konstantin Neuhaus, Eva Jiménez-Siebert, Nikolai Peschek, Timo Glatter, Kai Papenfort, Knut Drescher","<p>The extracellular matrix is a defining feature of bacterial biofilms and provides structural stability to the community by binding cells to the surface and to each other. Transitions between bacterial biofilm initiation, growth, and dispersion require different regulatory programs, all of which result in modifications to the extracellular matrix composition, abundance, or functionality. However, the mechanisms by which individual cells in biofilms disengage from the matrix to enable their departure during biofilm dispersal are unclear. Here, we investigated active biofilm dispersal of <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> during nutrient starvation, resulting in the discovery of the conserved <italic>Vibrio</italic> biofilm dispersal regulator VbdR. We show that VbdR triggers biofilm dispersal by controlling cellular release from the biofilm matrix, which is achieved by inducing the retraction of the mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA) type IV pili and the expression of a matrix protease IvaP. We further show that MSHA pili have numerous binding partners in the matrix and that the joint effect of MSHA pilus retraction and IvaP activity is necessary and sufficient for causing biofilm dispersal. These results highlight the crucial role of type IV pilus dynamics during biofilm dispersal and provide a new target for controlling <italic>V. cholerae</italic> biofilm abundance through the induction and manipulation of biofilm dispersal.</p>",2021-05-02

Here, we describe a functional CRISPR/Cas9 screen aiming at identifying SARS-CoV-2 restriction factors. We identified DAXX, a scaffold protein residing in PML nuclear bodies known to limit the replication of DNA viruses and retroviruses, as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. Basal expression of DAXX was sufficient to limit the replication of the virus, and DAXX over-expression further restricted infection. In contrast with most of its previously described antiviral activities, DAXX-mediated restriction of SARS-CoV-2 was independent of the SUMOylation pathway. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered the re-localization of DAXX to cytoplasmic sites of viral replication and led to its degradation. Together, these results demonstrate that DAXX is a potent restriction factor for SARS-CoV-2 and that the virus has evolved a mechanism to counteract its action.</p>",2021-05-06

Dobson, Michele Vendruscolo, Agnieszka Chacinska","<p>Mitochondria are organelles with their own genomes but rely on the import of nuclear-encoded proteins synthesized by cytosolic ribosomes. Therefore, it is important to understand whether failures in the mitochondrial uptake of these nuclear-encoded proteins may cause proteotoxic stress, and to identify which response mechanisms may be in place to respond to it. Here, we report that upon mitochondrial protein import impairment, high-risk precursor and immature forms of mitochondrial proteins form aberrant deposits in the cytosol. In turn, these deposits cause further cytosolic accumulation of other mitochondrial and disease-related proteins, including α-synuclein and amyloid β. This aberrant accumulation triggers a cytosolic protein homeostasis imbalance that is accompanied by specific molecular chaperone responses, both at the transcriptomic and protein levels. Our results provide evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction, and specifically protein import defects, can contribute to protein homeostasis impairment, thus revealing a possible molecular mechanism for mitochondrial involvement in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>",2021-05-02

Tan, Jingsi Ming, Angela Ruohao Wu, Tabula Sapiens Consortium, Stephen R. Quake, Mark A. Krasnow, Julia Salzman","<p>More than 95% of human genes are alternatively spliced. Yet, the extent splicing is regulated at single-cell resolution has remained controversial due to both available data and methods to interpret it. We apply the SpliZ, a new statistical approach that is agnostic to transcript annotation, to detect cell-type-specific regulated splicing in &gt; 110K carefully annotated single cells from 12 human tissues. Using 10x data for discovery, 9.1% of genes with computable SpliZ scores are cell-type specifically spliced. These results are validated with RNA FISH, single cell PCR, and in high throughput with Smart-seq2. Regulated splicing is found in ubiquitously expressed genes such as actin light chain subunit <italic>MYL6</italic> and ribosomal protein <italic>RPS24</italic>, which has an epithelial-specific microexon. 13% of the statistically most variable splice sites in cell-type specifically regulated genes are also most variable in mouse lemur or mouse. SpliZ analysis further reveals 170 genes with regulated splicing during sperm development using, 10 of which are conserved in mouse and mouse lemur. The statistical properties of the SpliZ allow model-based identification of subpopulations within otherwise indistinguishable cells based on gene expression, illustrated by subpopulations of classical monocytes with stereotyped splicing, including an un-annotated exon, in <italic>SAT1</italic>, a Diamine acetyltransferase. Together, this unsupervised and annotation-free analysis of differential splicing in ultra high throughput droplet-based sequencing of human cells across multiple organs establishes splicing is regulated cell-type-specifically independent of gene expression.</p>",2021-05-02

Fitzpatrick, Abigail Kalmbach, Rachael Neve, Joseph B Rayman, Eric R. Kandel","<p>The ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is critical for both learned and innate fear, but how discrete projections control different types of fear is poorly understood. Here, we report a novel excitatory circuit from a subpopulation of the ventral hippocampus CA1 subfield (vCA1) to the inhibitory peri-paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (pPVN) which then routes to the periaqueductal grey (PAG). We find that vCA1→pPVN projections modulate <italic>both</italic> learned and innate fear. Fiber photometric calcium recordings reveal that activity in vCA1→pPVN projections increases during the first moments of exposure to an unconditioned threat. Chemogenetic or optogenetic silencing of vCA1→pPVN cell bodies or vCA1→pPVN axon terminals in the pPVN enhances the initial magnitude of both active and passive unconditioned defensive responses, irrespective of the sensory modalities engaged by a particular innate threat. Moreover, silencing produces a dramatic impact on learned fear without affecting milder anxiety-like behaviors. We also show that vCA1→pPVN projections monosynaptically route to the PAG, a key brain region that orchestrates the fear response. Surprisingly, optogenetic silencing of vCA1 terminals in the pPVN titrates the level of c-Fos neural activity in the PAG differently for learned versus innate threats. Together, our results show how a novel vCA1→pPVN circuit modulates neuronal activity in the PAG to regulate both learned and innate fear. These findings have implications for how initial trauma processing may influence maladaptive defensive behaviors across fear and trauma-related disorders.</p><sec><title>One Sentence Summary</title><p>A multisensory gate for high intensity aversive experiences.</p></sec>",2021-05-02

We identified MYB16, a key transcription factor controlling cutin biosynthesis, from previous stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC)-enriched transcriptome study. The preferential localization of MYB16 in SLGCs but not meristemoids suggests a link between cutin synthesis and stomatal development. Here, we showed that downregulation of MYB16 in meristemoids was directly mediated by the stomatal master transcription factor, SPEECHLESS (SPCH). The suppression of MYB16 before asymmetric division was crucial for stomatal patterning because overexpression or ectopic expression of MYB16 in meristemoids increased impermeability and elevated stomatal density and clusters. The aberrant pattern of stomata was due to reduced and disrupted establishment of polarity during asymmetric cell division. Manipulating polarity by growing seedlings on hard agar rescued stomatal clusters and polarity defects in MYB16 ectopic lines. By expressing a cutinase in MYB16 ectopic lines, stomatal clustering was reduced, which suggests that the ectopic accumulation of cuticle affects the polarity in asymmetrically dividing cells and causes clustered stomata. Taken together, inhibiting MYB16 expression by SPCH in early stomatal lineage is required to correctly place the polarity complex for proper stomatal patterning during leaf morphogenesis.</p>",2021-05-03

Munster","<p>The circulation of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs). It is currently unclear whether previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 provides protection against reinfection with VOCs. Here, we show that low dose aerosol exposure to hCoV-19/human/USA/WA-CDC-WA1/2020 (WA1, lineage A), resulted in a productive mild infection. In contrast, low dose of SARS-CoV-2 via fomites did not result in productive infection in the majority of exposed hamsters and these animals remained non-seroconverted. After recovery, hamsters were re-exposed to hCoV-19/South African/KRISP-K005325/2020 (VOC B.1.351) via an intranasal challenge. Seroconverted rechallenged animals did not lose weight and shed virus for 3 days. They had little infectious virus and no pathology in the lungs. In contrast, shedding, weight loss and extensive pulmonary pathology caused by B.1.351 replication was observed in the non-seroconverted animals. The rechallenged seroconverted animals did not transmit virus to naïve sentinels via direct contact transmission, in contrast to the non-seroconverted animals. Reinfection with B.1.351 triggered an anamnestic response that boosted not only neutralizing titers against lineage A, but also titers against B.1.351. Our results confirm that aerosol exposure is a more efficient infection route than fomite exposure. Furthermore, initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 lineage A does not prevent heterologous reinfection with B.1.351 but prevents disease and onward transmission. These data suggest that previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure induces partial protective immunity. The reinfection generated a broadly neutralizing humoral response capable of effectively neutralizing B.1.351 while maintaining its ability to neutralize the virus to which the initial response was directed against.</p>",2021-05-05

Users of the COVID Symptom Study smartphone application reported use of aspirin and other NSAIDs between March 24 and May 8, 2020. Users were queried daily about symptoms, COVID-19 testing, and healthcare seeking behavior. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine the risk of COVID-19 among according to aspirin or non-aspirin NSAID users. Among 2,736,091 individuals in the U.S., U.K., and Sweden, we documented 8,966 incident reports of a positive COVID-19 test over 60,817,043 person-days of follow-up. Compared to non-users and after stratifying by age, sex, country, day of study entry, and race/ethnicity, non-aspirin NSAID use was associated with a modest risk for testing COVID-19 positive (HR 1.23 [1.09, 1.32]), but no significant association was observed among aspirin users (HR 1.13 [0.92, 1.38]). After adjustment for lifestyle factors, comorbidities and baseline symptoms, any NSAID use was not associated with risk (HR 1.02 [0.94, 1.10]). Results were similar for those seeking healthcare for COVID-19 and were not substantially different according to lifestyle and sociodemographic factors or after accounting for propensity to receive testing.

These findings imply that mechanisms of aging might contribute to patterns of multimorbidity in humans, and hence could be targeted to prevent multiple conditions simultaneously. To address this question, we text mined 917,645 literature abstracts followed by manual curation, and found strong, non-random associations between age-related diseases and aging mechanisms, confirmed by gene set enrichment analysis of GWAS data. Integration of these associations with clinical data from 3.01 million patients showed that age-related diseases associated with each of five aging mechanisms were more likely than chance to be present together in patients. Genetic evidence revealed that innate and adaptive immunity, the intrinsic apoptotic signalling pathway and activity of the ERK1/2 pathway played a significant role across multiple aging mechanisms and multiple, diverse age-related diseases. Mechanisms of aging therefore contribute to multiple age-related diseases and to patterns of human age-related multimorbidity, and could potentially be targeted to prevent more than one age-related condition in the same patient.</p>",2021-05-05

Neurons of the basal forebrain nucleus basalis and substantia innominata (NBM/SIp) comprise the major source of cholinergic input to the basolateral amygdala (BLA), whose activation are required for both the acquisition and retrieval of cued threat memory and innate threat response behavior. The retrieval of threat memory by the presentation of the conditioning tone alone elicits acetylcholine (ACh) release in the BLA and the BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons manifest immediate early gene responses and display increased intrinsic excitability for 2-5 hours following the cue-elicited memory response to the conditioned stimulus. Silencing cue-associated engram-enrolled cholinergic neurons prevents the expression of the defensive response and the subset of cholinergic neurons activated by cue is distinct from those engaged by innate threat. Taken together we find that distinct populations of cholinergic neurons are recruited to signal distinct aversive stimuli via the BLA, demonstrating exquisite, functionally refined organization of specific types of memory within the cholinergic basal forebrain.</p>",2021-05-03

Ferguson, Mark A. Lemmon","<p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently mutated in human cancer, and is an important therapeutic target. EGFR inhibitors have been successful in lung cancer, where the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain is mutated, but not in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) – where mutations (or deletions) occur exclusively in the EGFR extracellular region. Wild-type EGFR is known to elicit distinct signals in response to different growth factor ligands, exhibiting biased agonism. We recently showed that individual ligands stabilize distinct receptor dimer structures, which signal with different kinetics to specify outcome. EGF induces strong symmetric dimers that signal transiently to promote proliferation. Epiregulin (EREG) induces weak asymmetric dimers that generate sustained signaling and differentiation. Intriguingly, several GBM mutation hotspots coincide with residues that define the asymmetric and symmetric dimer structures. Here, we show that common extracellular GBM mutations prevent EGFR from distinguishing between EGF and EREG based on dimer structure and stability – allowing strong dimers to form with both ligands. Crystal structures show that the R84K mutation symmetrizes EREG-driven dimers, whereas the A265V mutation remodels key dimerization sites. Our results suggest that modulating EGFR’s biased agonism plays an important role in GBM, and suggest new approaches for ‘correcting’ aberrant EGFR signaling in cancer.</p>",2021-05-04

However, interpretation of the complex relationships of associated genes and phenotypes is challenging. Results: We constructed a tissue-level phenome-wide network map of colocalized genes and phenotypes. First, we generated colocalized expression quantitative trait loci from 48 tissues of the Genotype-Tissue Expression project and from publicly available genome-wide association study summary statistics from the UK Biobank. We identified 9,151 colocalized genes for 1,411 phenotypes across 48 tissues. Then, we constructed a bipartite network using the colocalized signals to establish links between genes and phenotypes in each tissue. The majority of links are observed in a single tissue whereas only a few are present in all tissues. Finally, we applied the biLouvain clustering algorithm in each tissue-specific bipartite network to identify co-clusters of non-overlapping genes and phenotypes. The majority of co-clusters contains a small number of genes and phenotypes, and 88.6% of co-clusters are found in only one tissue. To demonstrate functionality of the phenome-wide map, we tested if these co-clusters were enriched with known biological and functional gene classes and observed several significant enrichments. Furthermore, we observed that tissue-specific co-clusters are enriched with reported drug side effects for the corresponding drug target genes in clinical trial data. Conclusions: The phenome-wide map provides links between genes, phenotypes and tissues across a wide spectrum of biological classes and can yield biological and clinical discoveries.

Here we characterise structural brain correlates of gestational age at birth in healthy term-born neonates and their relationship to later neurodevelopmental outcome. We used T2 and diffusion weighted Magnetic Resonance Images acquired in the neonatal period from a cohort (n=454) of healthy babies born at term age (&gt;37 weeks gestation) and scanned between 1 and 41 days after birth. Images were analysed using tensor based morphometry (TBM) and tract based spatial statistics (TBSS). Neurodevelopment was subsequently assessed at age 18 months using the Bayley-III Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (n=281), and the effects of gestational age at birth and related neuroimaging findings on outcome were analysed with linear regression. Infants born earlier had areas of higher relative ventricular volume, and lower relative brain volume in the basal ganglia, cerebellum and brainstem. Earlier birth was also associated with lower fractional anisotropy, higher mean, axial and radial diffusivity in major white matter tracts. Gestational age at birth was positively associated with all Bayley-III subscales at age 18 months. Linear regression models predicting outcome from gestational age at birth were significantly improved by adding neuroimaging features associated with gestational age at birth.

In the present study, locomotor biomechanics were quantified from semi-aquatic <italic>Pleurodeles waltl</italic>, a salamander that spends most of its adult life in water, and then compared to a primarily terrestrial salamander (<italic>Ambystoma tigrinum</italic>) and semi-aquatic fish (<italic>Periophthalmus barbarus</italic>) to evaluate whether walking mechanics show greater similarity between species with ecological versus phylogenetic similarities.

To test this hypothesis, we trained participants to recognize vibrotactile versions of auditory words using two encoding schemes. The vocoded approach preserved the dynamics and representational similarities of auditory speech while the token-based approach used an abstract phoneme-based code. Although both groups learned the vibrotactile word recognition task, only in the vocoded group did trained vibrotactile stimuli recruit the auditory speech network and lead to increased coupling between somatosensory and auditory speech areas.

This “early” olfactory information process has two important characteristics. First, response of a PN to its cognate ORN is normalized by the overall activity of other ORNs, a phenomenon termed “divisive normalization”. Second, PNs respond strongly to the onset of ORN activities, but they adapt to prolonged or continuously increasing inputs. Despite the importance of these characteristics for learning and memory, their underlying mechanism remains not fully understood. Here, we develop a circuit model for describing the ORN-LN-PN dynamics by including key features of neuron-neuron interactions, in particular short-term plasticity (STP) and presynaptic inhibition (PI). Our model shows that STP is critical in shaping PN’s steady-state response properties. By fitting our model to experimental data quantitatively, we found that strong and balanced short-term facilitation (STF) and short-term depression (STD) in STP is crucial for the observed nonlinear divisive normalization in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. By comparing our model with the observed adaptive response to time-varying signals quantitatively, we find that both STP and PI contribute to the highly adaptive response with the latter being the dominant factor for a better fit with experimental data.

While there is general knowledge regarding the taxonomic groups that leeches prefer to feed on, detailed taxonomic resolution is still missing and therefore, their potential use for monitoring animals is not known. In this study, 116 non-haemadipsid leeches belonging to 12 species and spanning the three feeding habits were collected in Mexico and Canada.

We found that autotetraploid Columbia (Col-0) plants generate a subpopulation of aberrant meiotic products under normal temperature, which is significantly increased under heat stress. Cytological studies revealed that, as the case in diploid Arabidopsis thaliana, assembly of microtubular cytoskeleton network, pairing and segregation of homologous chromosomes, and meiotic recombination in autotetraploid Arabidopsis are compromised under the high temperatures. Immunostaining of ?H2A.X and recombinase DMC1 suggested that heat stress inhibits formation of DNA double-strand breaks; additionally, it specifically destabilizes ASY1 and ASY4, but not SYN1 on chromosomes. The loading defects of ASY1 and ASY4 overlap in the syn1 mutant, which supports that the building of lateral element of synaptonemal complex occurs downstream of a SYN1-ASY4-ASY3 stepwise assembly of axis. Remarkably, heat-induced abnormalities of ASY1 and ASY4 co-localize on chromosomes of both diploid and autotetraploid Arabidopsis, suggesting that high temperatures interfere with ASY1-associated SC via an impacted stability of chromosome axis. Furthermore, ZYP1-dependent transverse filament of SC is disrupted by heat stress.

Reiman, Kaj Blennow, Zetterberg Henrik, Sairam Parthasarathy","<p>In critically ill COVID-19 patients, the risk of long-term neurological consequences is just beginning to be appreciated. While recent studies have identified that there is an increase in structural injury to the nervous system in critically ill COVID-19 patients, there is little known about the relationship of COVID-19 neurological damage to the systemic inflammatory diseases also observed in COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this pilot observational study was to examine the relationships between serum neurofilament light protein (NfL, a measure of neuronal injury) and co-morbid cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neurological complications in COVID-19 positive patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). In this observational study of one-hundred patients who were admitted to the ICU in Tucson, Arizona between April and August 2020, 89 were positive for COVID-19 (COVID-pos) and 11 were COVID-negative (COVID-neg). A healthy control group (n=8) was examined for comparison. The primary outcomes and measures were subject demographics, serum NfL, presence and extent of CVD, diabetes, sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA), presence of neurological complications, and blood chemistry panel data. COVID-pos patients in the ICU had significantly higher mean levels of Nfl (229.6±163 pg/ml) compared to COVID-neg ICU patients (19.3±5.6 pg/ml), Welch’s t-test, p =.01 and healthy controls (12.3±3.1 pg/ml), Welch’s t-test p =.005. Levels of Nfl in COVID-pos ICU patients were significantly higher in patients with concomitant CVD and diabetes (n=35, log Nfl 1.6±.09), and correlated with higher SOFA scores (r=.5, p =.001). These findings suggest that in severe COVID-19 disease, the central neuronal and axonal damage in these patients may be driven, in part, by the level of systemic cardiovascular disease and peripheral inflammation. Understanding the contributions of systemic inflammatory disease to central neurological degeneration in these COVID-19 survivors will be important to the design of interventional therapies to prevent long-term neurological and cognitive dysfunction.</p>",2021-05-02

Currently, known differences between these two states are mostly phenomenological, and none can adequately explain why the two states should differ in developmental priming. Gene occlusion is a mode of epigenetic inactivation that renders genes unresponsive to their cognate transcriptional activators. It plays a crucial role in lineage restriction. Here, we report that a defining feature distinguishing the two pluripotent states lies in the ability of naive but not primed cells to erase occlusion. This “deocclusion” capacity requires Esrrb, a gene expressed only in the naive but not primed state. Notably, Esrrb silencing in the primed state is itself due to occlusion. Collectively, our data argue that the Esrrb-dependent deocclusion capacity in naive cells is key for sustaining naive pluripotency, and the loss of this capacity in the primed state via the occlusion of Esrrb poises cells for differentiation.</p>",2021-05-04

Recent studies indicate that the composition and molecular organization of phase-separated organelles such as Stress Granules (SGs) and Processing Bodies (PBs) are highly variable and dynamic. A dense contact network involving both RNAs and proteins controls the formation of SGs and PBs and an intricate molecular architecture, at present poorly understood, guarantees that these assemblies sense and adapt to different stresses and environmental changes. Here, we investigated the physico-chemical properties of SGs and PBs components and studied the architecture of their interaction networks. We observed that proteins and RNAs establishing the largest amount of contacts have distinct structural characteristics. More specifically, we found that structural disorder is enriched in all protein-RNA, protein-protein and RNA-RNA interactions. Intriguingly, enrichment in the disorder of proteins is linked to increased number of interactions with single-stranded regions in RNAs. Our findings support the hypothesis that SGs and PBs can quickly assemble and disassemble thanks to the activity of unfolded domains in proteins and single-stranded regions in RNAs, guaranteeing the formation of dynamic contacts.</p>",2021-05-05

However, the extent to which these correlations are due to adaptive and non-adaptive evolution has not been studied in detail, at least not in hominids. We find that the rate of adaptive evolution is significantly positively correlated to the rate of recombination, protein length and gene expression level, and negatively correlated to gene age. The correlations remain significant when each factor is controlled for in turn, except when controlling for expression in an analysis of protein length; and they also remain significant, or marginally significant, when biased gene conversion is controlled for. However, the positive correlations could be an artefact of population size contraction. We also find that the rate of non-adaptive evolution is negatively correlated to each factor, and all these correlations survive controlling for each other and biased gene conversion. Finally, we examine the effect of gene function on rates of adaptive and non-adaptive evolution; we confirm that virus interacting proteins (VIPs) have higher rates of adaptive and lower rates of non-adaptive evolution, but we also demonstrate that there is significant variation in the rate of adaptive and non-adaptive evolution between GO categories when removing VIPs. We estimate that the VIP/non-VIP axis explains about 5-8x more of the variance in evolutionary rate than GO categories.</p>",2021-05-05

To test that hypothesis, we enrolled 114 participants within 3-7 days of receiving the first dose of the Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and collected oral mucosal fluid samples on days 5, 10, 15, and 20 after each vaccine dose. Of participants naive to SARS-CoV-2 (n = 89), 79 (85.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by time point 2 (10 days +/-2 days after first vaccine dose), and 100% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG by time point 3 (15 days +/- 2 days after first vaccine dose). Additionally, we collected paired oral mucosal fluid and anterior nares samples from 10 participants who had received both vaccine doses. We found that participants had an average SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody concentration of 2496.0 +/- 2698.0ng/mL in nasal mucosal fluid versus 153.4 +/- 141.0ng/mL in oral mucosal fluid. Here, we demonstrate detection and longitudinal persistence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in upper respiratory tract specimens following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination.

Interactions between clients and care workers are modelled using specially generated networks, with network parameters reflecting realistic patterns of care needs and visit allocation. These networks are then used to simulate and SEIR-type epidemic dynamics with different numbers of infectious and recovery stages. The results indicate that with the same overall capacity provided by care workers, the minimum peak proportion of infection, and the smallest overall size of infection are achieved for the highest proportion of overlap between visit allocation, i.e. when care workers have the highest chances of being allocated a visit to the same client they have visited before. An intuitive explanation of this is that while providing the required care coverage, maximising overlap in visit allocation reduces the possibility of an infectious care worker inadvertently spreading the infection to other clients.

One possible solution is to prescribe drugs in combination. Synergistic drug combinations could allow lower doses of each constituent drug, reducing adverse reactions and drug resistance. However, it is not feasible to sufficiently test every combination of drugs for a given illness to determine promising synergistic combinations. Since there is a finite amount of time and resources available for finding synergistic combinations, a model that can identify synergistic combinations from a limited subset of all available combinations could accelerate development of therapeutics. By applying recommender algorithms, such as the low-rank matrix completion algorithm Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF), it may be possible to identify synergistic combinations from partial information of the drug interactions. Here, we use PMF to predict the efficacy of two-drug combinations using the NCI ALMANAC, a robust collection of pairwise drug combinations of 104 FDA-approved anticancer drugs against 60 common cancer cell lines.

A conserved histidine triad in LASV GP1 has been reported to be responsible for receptor switch. To test the hypothesis that other non-conserved residues also contribute to receptor switch, we constructed a series of GP1 mutant proteins and tested them for binding to LAMP1.

Many insects are subject to a trade-off between reproduction and immune activity, meaning that infections can have indirect impacts on fecundity, even in the absence of overt symptoms. While eusocial insects have escaped a broader trade-off between reproduction and lifespan, our results suggest that honey bees, a model Hymenopteran, are susceptible to reproduction-immunity compromises. We report that natural viral infection is associated with decreased ovary mass and upregulation of heat-shock proteins (HSPs) which are part of the honey bee's antiviral response. Failed (poor quality) queens sampled from a wide geographic range have higher levels of viral infection, smaller ovaries, and altered ovarian protein composition, with over 20% of proteins differentially expressed. Significantly reduced levels of the yolk-protein precursor vitellogenin in the ovaries indicate a direct decline in fertility. We experimentally infected queens with Israeli acute paralysis virus and, as expected, infected queens exhibited significantly lower vitellogenin expression and higher HSP expression, confirming a causal relationship between viral infection and genes involved in fertility and immunity. The link between ovary size and queen failure could not be explained by other abiotic stressors. These findings suggest that viral infections occurring naturally in the field are compromising reproductive success, even among social insects.</p>",2021-05-04

While a reliable protein function assignment can be obtained by experimental characterization, this is expensive and time-consuming, and the number of such Gold Standard Proteins (GSP) with experimental support remains very low compared to proteins annotated by sequence homology, usually through automated pipelines. Even a GSP may give a misleading assignment when used as a reference: the homolog may be close enough to support isofunctionality, but the substrate of the GSP is absent from the species being annotated. In such cases the enzymes cannot be isofunctional. Here, we examine a variety of such issues in halophilic archaea (class Halobacteria), with a strong focus on the model haloarchaeon <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Annotated proteins of <italic>Hfx. volcanii</italic> were identified for which public databases tend to assign a function that is probably incorrect. In some cases, an alternative, probably correct, function can be predicted or inferred from the available evidence but this has not been adopted by public databases because experimental validation is lacking. In other cases, a probably invalid specific function is predicted by homology, and while there is evidence that this assigned function is unlikely, the true function remains elusive. We list 50 of those cases, each with detailed background information so that a conclusion about the most likely biological function can be drawn. For reasons of brevity and comprehension, only key aspects are listed in the main text, with detailed information being provided in a corresponding section of the Supplementary Material.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Compiling, describing and summarizing these open annotation issues and functional predictions will benefit the scientific community in the general effort to improve the evaluation of protein function assignments and more thoroughly detail them. By highlighting the gaps and likely annotation errors currently in the databases, we hope this study will provide a framework for experimentalists to sytematically confirm (or disprove) our function predictions or to uncover yet unexpected functions.</p></sec>",2021-05-03
