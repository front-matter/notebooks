Testis morphologies and spermatogenesis evolve rapidly in mammals, presumably due to the evolutionary pressure on males to be reproductively successful<sup>1,2</sup>. The rapid evolution of the testis was shown to be reflected at the molecular level based on bulk-tissue work<sup>3-8</sup>, but the molecular evolution of individual spermatogenic cell types across mammalian lineages remains largely uncharacterized. Here we report evolutionary analyses of single-nucleus transcriptome data for testes from eleven species that cover the three major mammalian lineages (eutherians, marsupials, egg-laying monotremes) and birds (the evolutionary outgroup), and include seven key primates. Our analyses reveal that the rapid evolution of the testis is driven by accelerated fixation rates of gene expression changes, amino acid altering substitutions, and newly emerged genes in late spermatogenic stages – likely facilitated by reduced pleiotropic constraints, haploid selection, and a transcriptionally permissive chromatin environment. We identify temporal expression changes of individual genes across species, which may have contributed to the emergence of species-specific phenotypes, but also conserved expression programs underlying ancestral spermatogenic processes. Sex chromosome analyses show that genes predominantly expressed in spermatogonia (i.e., germ cells fueling spermatogenesis) and Sertoli cells (i.e., somatic supporting cells) independently accumulated on X chromosomes across mammals during evolution, presumably due to male-beneficial selective forces. Further work uncovered that the process of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) also occurs in monotremes and hence is common to the different mammalian sex chromosome systems, contrary to previous inferences<sup>9</sup>. Thus, the general mechanism of meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC), which underlies MSCI, represents an ancestral mammalian feature. Together, our study illuminates the cellular and molecular evolution of mammalian spermatogenesis and associated selective forces, and provides a resource for investigating the biology of the testis across mammals.</p>",2021-11-08

The popular GCaMP indicators are based on the calcium-binding protein calmodulin and the RS20 peptide. These sensors report neural activity at timescales much slower than electrical signaling, limited by their biophysical properties and trade-offs between sensitivity and speed. We used large-scale screening and structure-guided mutagenesis to develop and optimize several fast and sensitive GCaMP-type indicators. The resulting ‘jGCaMP8’ sensors, based on calmodulin and a fragment of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, have ultra-fast kinetics (rise times, 2 ms) and still feature the highest sensitivity for neural activity reported for any protein-based sensor. jGCaMP8 sensors will allow tracking of larger populations of neurons on timescales relevant to neural computation.</p>",2021-11-08

Understanding the magnitude of diversity in root distribution within the soil, termed root system architecture (RSA), is fundamental to determining how this trait contributes to species adaptation in local environments. Roots are the interface between the soil environment and the shoot system and therefore play a key role in anchorage, resource uptake, and stress resilience. Previously, we presented the GLO-Roots (Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots) system to study the RSA of soil-grown Arabidopsis thaliana plants from germination to maturity. In this study, we present the automation of GLO-Roots using robotics and the development of image analysis pipelines in order to examine the natural variation of RSA in Arabidopsis over time.

Moreover, authors suggested more men from the BRE pool, even after correcting for men’s numerical over-representation. Although women editors were proportionally involved in the initial editorial process, they were under-engaged in editorial activities involving reviewers and authors. Additionally, converging evidence showed gender homophily in manuscripts assignment, such that men Senior Editors over-engaged men Reviewing Editors. This tendency was stronger in more gender-balanced scientific disciplines. Together, our findings confirm that gender disparities exist along the editorial process and suggest that merely increasing the proportion of women might not be sufficient to eliminate this bias.</p>",2021-11-10

This ability facilitates protein tagging, correction of pathogenic deletions, and many other exciting applications. However, it remains unclear what types of sequences prime editors can easily insert, and how to choose optimal reagents for a desired outcome. To characterize features that influence insertion efficiency, we designed a library of 2,666 sequences up to 69 nt in length and measured the frequency of their insertion into four genomic sites in three human cell lines, using different prime editor systems. We discover that insertion sequence length, nucleotide composition and secondary structure all affect insertion rates, and that mismatch repair proficiency is a strong determinant for the shortest insertions. Combining the sequence and repair features into a machine learning model, we can predict insertion frequency for new sequences with R = 0.69.

Cánovas'}, {'name': 'Bertrand Hirel'}, {'name': 'Francisco R. Cantón'}, {'name': 'Rafael A. Cañas'}]","<p>Glutamine synthetase (GS) is a key enzyme responsible for the incorporation of inorganic nitrogen in the form of ammonium into the amino acid glutamine. The genes encoding GS are among the oldest existing genes in living organisms. In plants, two groups of functional GS enzymes are found: eubacterial <italic>GSIIb</italic> (<italic>GLN2</italic>) and eukaryotic <italic>GSIIe</italic> (<italic>GLN1</italic>/<italic>GS</italic>). Phylogenetic analyses have shown that the <italic>GLN2</italic> group originated from bacteria following horizontal gene transfer. Only <italic>GLN1/GS</italic> genes are found in vascular plants, which suggests that they are involved in the final adaptation of plants to terrestrial life. The present phylogenetic study reclassifies the different GS of seed plants into three clusters: <italic>GS1a, GS1b</italic> and <italic>GS2</italic>. The presence of genes encoding GS2 has been expanded to Cycadopsida gymnosperms, which suggests the origin of this gene in a common ancestor of Cycadopsida, Ginkgoopsida and angiosperms. <italic>GS1a</italic> genes have been identified in all gymnosperms, basal angiosperms and some Magnoliidae species. Previous studies in conifers and the gene expression profiles obtained in ginkgo and magnolia in the present work could explain the absence of GS1a in more recent angiosperm species (e.g., monocots and eudicots) due to the redundant roles of GS1a and GS2 in photosynthetic cells. Altogether, the results provide a better understanding of the evolution of plant GS isoenzymes and their physiological roles, which is valuable for improving crop nitrogen use efficiency and productivity.</p>",2021-11-08

To address this challenge, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing of lung autopsies from 31 patients suffering from severe COVID-19 related complications and 10 uninfected controls. Using a metatranscriptome analysis of lung tissue samples we identified the existence of two distinct molecular signatures of lethal COVID-19. The dominant “classical” signature (n=23) showed upregulation of unfolded protein response, steroid biosynthesis and complement activation supported by massive metabolic reprogramming leading to characteristic lung damage. The rarer signature (n=8) potentially representing “Cytokine Release Syndrome” (CRS) showed upregulation of IL1 cytokines such CCL19 but absence of complement activation and muted inflammation. Further, dissecting expression of individual genes within enriched pathways for patient signature suggests heterogeneity in host response to the primary infection. We found that the majority of patients cleared the SARS-CoV-2 infection, but all suffered from acute dysbiosis with characteristic enrichment of opportunistic pathogens such as <italic>Gordonia bronchialis</italic> in “classical” patients and <italic>Staphylococcus warneri</italic> in CRS patients. Our results suggest two distinct models of lung pathology in severe COVID-19 patients that can be identified through the status of the complement activation, presence of specific cytokines and characteristic microbiome. This information can be used to design personalized therapy to treat COVID-19 related complications corresponding to patient signature such as using the identified drug molecules or mitigating specific secondary infections.</p>",2021-11-08

However, its impact on the biological age of organisms and their long-term health remains unknown. Here, we performed extended (3-month) HPB, followed by a 2-month detachment period of anastomosed pairs. Old detached mice exhibited improved physiological parameters and lived longer than control isochronic mice. HPB drastically reduced the biological age of blood and liver based on epigenetic analyses across several clock models on two independent platforms; remarkably, this rejuvenation effect persisted even after 2 months of detachment. Transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles of anastomosed mice showed an intermediate phenotype between old and young, suggesting a comprehensive multi-omic rejuvenation effect. In addition, old HPB mice showed transcriptome changes opposite to aging, but akin to several lifespan-extending interventions. Altogether, we reveal that long-term HPB can decrease the biological age of mice, in part through long-lasting epigenetic and transcriptome remodeling, culminating in the extension of lifespan and healthspan.</p>",2021-11-12

Dormancy may also benefit bacteria by serving as a refuge from parasitic infections. Here we focus on dormancy in the Firmicutes, where endospore development is transcriptionally regulated by the expression of sigma factors. A disruption of this process could influence the survivorship and reproduction of phages that infect spore-forming hosts with implications for coevolutionary dynamics. Here, we characterized the distribution and diversity of sigma factors in nearly 3,500 phage genomes. Homologs of sporulation-specific sigma factors were identified in phages that infect spore-forming hosts. Unlike sigma factors required for phage reproduction, the sporulation-like sigma factors were non-essential for lytic infection. However, when expressed in the spore-forming Bacillus subtilis, sigma factors from phages activated the bacterial sporulation gene network and reduced spore yield. Our findings suggest that the acquisition of host-like transcriptional regulators may allow phages to manipulate a complex and ancient trait in one of the most abundant cell types on Earth.</p>",2021-11-12

We solved cryo-EM structures of TMEM106B filaments from the brains of 22 individuals with neurodegenerative conditions, including sporadic and inherited tauopathies, Aβ-amyloidoses, synucleinopathies and TDP-43opathies, as well as from the brains of two neurologically normal individuals. We observed three different TMEM106B folds, with no clear relationship between folds and diseases. The presence of TMEM106B filaments correlated with that of a 29 kDa sarkosyl-insoluble fragment of the protein on Western blots.

In this work, we propose a modification of ISM that leverages the principles of compressed sensing to require only a constant number of forward passes, regardless of sequence length, when applied to models that contain operations with a limited receptive field, such as convolutions. Our method, named Yuzu, can reduce the time that ISM spends in convolution operations by several orders of magnitude and, consequently, Yuzu can speed up ISM on several commonly used architectures in genomics by over an order of magnitude.

Most time-of-day expression profiles are largely conserved across all eight species and suggest that large perturbations to the central clock are not required for CAM evolution. In contrast, transcriptional response to drought is highly lineage specific. Yucca and Beschorneria have CAM-like expression of PPC2, a copy of PPC that has never been shown to be recruited for CAM in angiosperms, and evidence of positive selection in PPC genes implicates mutations that may have facilitated the recruitment for CAM function early in the evolutionary history of the Agavoideae. Together the physiological and transcriptomic comparison of closely related C3 and CAM species reveals similar gene expression profiles, with the notable exception of differential recruitment of carboxylase enzymes for CAM function.</p>",2021-11-12

Here, we use a mouse model to demonstrate how maternal high-fat diet causes perinatal inflammation that influences sex-specific behavioral outcomes in offspring. In male high-fat diet offspring, increased macrophage toll like receptor 4 signaling results in excess phagocytosis of serotonin neurons in the developing dorsal raphe nucleus, decreasing serotonin bioavailability in the fetal and adult brain. Bulk sequencing from a large cohort of matched first trimester human fetal brain, placenta, and maternal decidua samples reveals sex-specific transcriptome-wide changes in placenta and brain tissue.

Previous genetic studies unveiled that migrations from East Asia contributed to the spread of Turko-Mongolian populations in Central Asia and the partial replacement of the Indo-Iranian population. However, little is known about the origin of the latter. To shed light on this, we compare the genetic data on two current-day populations– Yaghnobis and Tajiks – with genome-wide data from published ancient individuals. The present Indo-Iranian populations from Central Asia display a strong genetic continuity with Iron Age samples from Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. We model Yaghnobis as a mixture of 93% Iron Age individual from Turkmenistan and 7% from Baikal.

In contrast, language regions in the inferior frontal and posterior temporal cortex showed the same pattern of increased response to longer constituents - and similar overall response magnitudes - for word and pseudoword sequences.

Here we identify methodological and theoretical concerns with the Pallier et al. study and conduct a replication across two fMRI experiments. Our results do not support Pallier et al.'s critical claim of distinct neural specialization for abstract syntactic representations. Instead, we find that all language regions show a similar profile of sensitivity to both constituent length and lexicality (stronger responses to real-word than pseudoword stimuli).

Here we revisited this link between microsaccades and neural modulation by covert spatial attention in humans. We investigated spatial modulation of 8-12 Hz EEG alpha activity and microsaccades in a context with no incentive for overt gaze behaviour: when attention is directed internally within the spatial layout of visual working memory. In line with a common attentional origin, we show that spatial modulations of alpha activity and microsaccades co-vary: alpha lateralisation is stronger in trials with microsaccades toward compared to away from the memorised location of the to-be-attended item and occurs earlier in trials with earlier microsaccades toward this item. Critically, however, trials without attention-driven microsaccades nevertheless showed clear spatial modulation of alpha activity – comparable to the neural modulation observed in trials with attention-driven microsaccades. Thus, directional biases in microsaccades are correlated with neural signatures of covert spatial attention, but they are not a prerequisite for neural modulation by covert spatial attention to be manifest.</p>",2021-11-11

Nicolae'}, {'name': 'George-Lucian Moldovan'}]","<p>The inability to protect stalled replication forks from nucleolytic degradation drives genome instability and is associated with chemosensitivity in BRCA-deficient tumors. An emerging hallmark of BRCA deficiency is the inability to suppress replication-associated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps. Here, we report that ssDNA gaps on the lagging strand interfere with the ASF1-CAF-1 pathway of nucleosome assembly, and drive fork degradation in BRCA-deficient cells. We show that CAF-1 function at replication forks is lost in BRCA-deficient cells, due to its sequestration at inactive replication factories during replication stress. This CAF-1 recycling defect is caused by the accumulation of Polα-dependent lagging strand gaps, which preclude PCNA unloading, causing sequestration of PCNA-CAF-1 complexes on chromatin. Importantly, correcting PCNA unloading defects in BRCA-deficient cells restores fork stability in a CAF-1-dependent manner. We also show that the activation of a HIRA-dependent compensatory histone deposition pathway restores fork stability to BRCA-deficient cells upon CAF-1 loss. We thus define nucleosome assembly as a critical determinant of BRCA-mediated fork stability. We further reveal lagging strand ssDNA gaps as drivers of fork degradation in BRCA-deficient cells, which operate by inhibiting PCNA unloading and CAF-1-dependent nucleosome assembly.</p>",2021-11-08

According to the current model, FtsA initiates cell constriction by switching from an inactive polymeric conformation to an active monomeric form, which then stabilizes the Z-ring and recruits downstream proteins such as FtsN.

We could attribute these differences to a faster membrane exchange of FtsA R286W as well as its higher packing density below FtsZ filaments.

Our results show that housekeeping promoters and CpG island promoters have lower activity in K562 cells relative to HEK293, which likely reflects developmental differences between the cell lines.

Finally, we deconvolved the intrinsic and extrinsic components of promoter cell-to-cell variability and found that developmental promoters have a higher proportion of extrinsic noise compared to housekeeping promoters, which may reflect the responsiveness of developmental promoters to the cellular environment.

This also significantly influenced locus configuration dynamics by modulating promoter-enhancer loops associated with protein bridging. Importantly these simulations indicate that chromatin dynamics are sufficiently fast to sample all possible conformations of loci within minutes, generating wide dynamic variability of gene loci structure within single cells.

While our understanding of this new virus is rapidly increasing, gaps remain in our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 can effectively suppress host cell antiviral responses. Recent work on other viruses has demonstrated a novel mechanism through which viral proteins can mimic critical regions of human histone proteins. Histone proteins are responsible for governing genome accessibility and their precise regulation is critical for a cell’s ability to control transcription and respond to viral threats. Here, we show that the protein encoded by ORF8 (Orf8) in SARS-CoV-2 functions as a histone mimic of the ARKS motif in histone 3. Orf8 is associated with chromatin, binds to numerous histone-associated proteins, and is itself acetylated within the histone mimic site. Orf8 expression in cells disrupts multiple critical histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) including H3K9ac, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3 and promotes chromatin compaction while Orf8 lacking the histone mimic motif does not. Further, SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cell lines and postmortem patient lung tissue cause these same disruptions to chromatin. However, deletion of the Orf8 gene from SARS-CoV-2 largely blocks its ability to disrupt host-cell chromatin indicating that Orf8 is responsible for these effects. Finally, deletion of the ORF8 gene affects the host-cell transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in multiple cell types and decreases the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived lung alveolar type 2 (iAT2) pulmonary cells. These findings demonstrate a novel function for the poorly understood ORF8-encoded protein and a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 disrupts host cell epigenetic regulation.

Here, we used strictly curated, controlled cross-sectional human cohorts of postmenopausal women, urobiome whole genome (shotgun) metagenomic sequencing (WGMS), advanced urine culturing techniques, extensive biobanking of &gt;900 patient-derived urinary bacterial and fungal isolates, and mass spectrometry-based estrogen profiling to survey the urobiome in rUTI patients during infection relapse and remission as well as healthy comparators with no lifetime history of UTI. Our results suggest that a history of rUTI strongly shapes the taxonomic and functional ecology of the urobiome. We also find a putative protective commensal population, consisting of species known to convey protection against bacterial vaginosis such as <italic>Lactobacillus crispatus</italic>, within the urobiome of women who do not experience UTI. Integration of clinical metadata detected an almost exclusive enrichment of putative protective species belonging to the genus, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, in women taking estrogen hormone therapy (EHT). We further show that the urobiome taxonomic ecology is shaped by EHT, with strong enrichments of putatively protective lactobacilli, such as <italic>L. crispatu</italic>s and <italic>L. vaginalis</italic>. Integrating quantitative metabolite profiling of urinary estrogens with WGMS, we observed robust associations between urobiome taxa, such as <italic>Bifidobacterium breve</italic> and <italic>L. crispatus</italic>, and urinary estrogen conjugate concentrations, suggesting that EHT strongly alters the taxonomic composition of the female urobiome. We have further used functional metagenomic profiling and patient-derived isolate phenotyping to identify microbial metabolic pathways, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), and clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance phenotypes enriched between disease-states. Our data suggest distinct metabolic and ARG signatures of the urobiome associated with current rUTI status and history. Taken together, our data suggests that rUTI history and estrogen use strongly shape the functional and taxonomic composition of the urobiome in postmenopausal women.</p>",2021-11-08

The plasma lipid pool is maintained through regulation of tissue production, secretion, and uptake. A major challenge is establishing the tissues of origin and uptake for various plasma lipids, which is necessary to determine the lipid function. Using cold exposure as an acute stress, we performed global lipidomics on the plasma and nine tissues that may contribute to the circulating pool. We found that numerous species of plasma acylcarnitines (ACars) and ceramides were significantly changed with cold exposure. Through computational assessment, we identified the liver and brown adipose tissue (BAT) as major contributors and consumers of circulating ACars, in agreement with our previous work. We further identified the kidney and intestine as novel contributors to the circulating ACar pool and validated these findings with gene expression analysis. Regression analysis also identified that the BAT and kidney as regulators of the plasma ceramide pool.

The spike proteins of B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and AY.1 variants have several substitutions in the receptor binding domain (RBD), including L452R+E484Q, L452R+T478K, and K417N+L452R+T478K, respectively, that could potentially reduce effectiveness of therapeutic antibodies and current vaccines.

Pseudoviruses with the B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and AY.1 spike showed a modest 1.5 to 4.4-fold reduction in neutralization titer by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited sera. In comparison, similar modest reductions were also observed for pseudoviruses with C.37, P.1, R.1, and B.1.526 spikes, but seven- and sixteen-fold reduction for vaccine-elicited and convalescent sera, respectively, was seen for pseudoviruses with the B.1.351 spike. Four of twenty-three therapeutic neutralizing antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.2 pseudoviruses due to the L452R substitution, whereas six of twenty-three therapeutic neutralizing antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.1 pseudoviruses due to either the E484Q or L452R substitution. Against AY.1 pseudoviruses, the L452R and K417N substitutions accounted for the loss of neutralization by four antibodies and one antibody, respectively, whereas one antibody lost potency that could not be fully accounted for by a single RBD substitution. The modest resistance of B.1.617 variants to vaccine-elicited sera suggest that current mRNA-based vaccines will likely remain effective in protecting against B.1.617 variants, but the therapeutic antibodies need to be carefully selected based on their resistance profiles. Finally, the spike proteins of B.1.617 variants are more efficiently cleaved due to the P681R substitution, and the spike of Delta variants exhibited greater sensitivity to soluble ACE2 neutralization, as well as fusogenic activity, which may contribute to enhanced spread of Delta variants.</p>",2021-11-08

Here we report that instead transporting cargoes along microtubules into the oocyte, cortical dynein actively moves microtubules in nurse cells and from nurse cells to the oocyte via the cytoplasmic bridges, the ring canals. We demonstrate this microtubule movement is sufficient to drag even inert cytoplasmic particles through the ring canals to the oocyte. Furthermore, replacing dynein with a minus-end directed plant kinesin linked to the actin cortex is sufficient for transporting organelles and cytoplasm to the oocyte and driving its growth. These experiments show that cortical dynein can perform bulk cytoplasmic transport by gliding microtubules along the cell cortex and through the ring canals to the oocyte.

We demonstrate that upregulation of a functional serine synthesis pathway is a metabolic hallmark of B-cell activation and the germinal center reaction. Inhibition of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), the first and rate limiting enzyme in this pathway, leads to defective germinal formation and impaired high-affinity antibody production. In addition, overexpression of enzymes involved in serine synthesis is a characteristic of germinal center B-cell derived lymphomas, with high levels of expression being predictive of reduced overall survival in diffuse large B cell lymphoma.

Here we identify and distinguish between two discrete PSTN subpopulations, those that express tachykinin-1 (PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons) and those that express corticotropin-releasing hormone (PSTN<sup>CRH</sup> neurons), and use a panel of genetically encoded tools in mice to show that PSTN<sup>Tac1</sup> neurons play an essential role in appetite suppression.

Membrane tension and cortical tension both influence many cellular processes, including cell migration, division, and endocytosis. However, while actomyosin tension is regulated by substrate stiffness, how membrane tension responds to mechanical substrate properties is currently poorly understood. Here, we probed the effective membrane tension of neurons and fibroblasts cultured on glass and polyacrylamide substrates of varying stiffness using optical tweezers. In contrast to actomyosin-based traction forces, both peak forces and steady state tether forces of cells cultured on hydrogels were independent of substrate stiffness and did not change after blocking myosin II activity using blebbistatin, indicating that tether and traction forces are not directly linked with each other. Peak forces on hydrogels were about twice as high in fibroblasts if compared to neurons, indicating stronger membrane-cortex adhesion in fibroblasts. Finally, tether forces were generally higher in cells cultured on hydrogels compared to cells cultured on glass, which we attribute to substrate-dependent alterations of the actomyosin cortex and an inverse relationship between tension along stress fibres and cortical tension. Our results provide new insights into the complex regulation of membrane tension, and they pave the way for a deeper understanding of biological processes instructed by it.</p>",2021-11-11

Cap removal is thus an integral component of mRNA turnover that is carried out by cellular decapping enzymes, whose activity is tightly regulated and coupled to other stages of the mRNA decay pathway. The poxvirus vaccinia virus (VACV) encodes its own decapping enzymes, D9 and D10, that act on cellular and viral mRNA, but may be regulated differently than their cellular counterparts. Here, we evaluated the targeting potential of these viral enzymes using RNA sequencing from cells infected with wild-type and decapping mutant versions of VACV as well as in uninfected cells expressing D10. We found that D9 and D10 target an overlapping subset of viral transcripts but that D10 plays a dominant role in depleting the vast majority of human transcripts, although not in an indiscriminate manner. Unexpectedly, the splicing architecture of a gene influences how robustly its corresponding transcript is targeted by D10, as transcripts derived from intronless genes are less susceptible to enzymatic decapping by D10. As all VACV genes are intronless, preferential decapping of transcripts from intron-encoding genes provides an unanticipated mechanism for the virus to disproportionately deplete host transcripts and remodel the infected cell transcriptome.</p>",2021-11-10

Nitric oxide is a critical effector molecule produced as a component of the innate immune response during infection. Using a 3-dimensional cortical organoid model, we demonstrate that nitric oxide inhibits HCMV spread and simultaneously disrupts neural rosette structures resulting in tissue disorganization. Nitric oxide also attenuates HCMV replication in 2-dimensional cultures of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), a prominent cell type in cortical organoids that differentiate into neurons and glial cells. The multipotency factor SOX2 was decreased during nitric oxide exposure, suggesting early neural differentiation is affected.

Although such synonymous codons do not alter the encoded amino acid sequence, their selection can dramatically affect the expression of the resulting protein. Codon optimization of synthetic DNA sequences is important for heterologous expression. However, existing solutions are primarily based on choosing high-frequency codons only, neglecting the important effects of rare codons. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent-neural-network based codon optimization tool, ICOR, that aims to learn codon usage bias on a genomic dataset of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. We compile a dataset of over 7,000 non-redundant, high-expression, robust genes which are used for deep learning. The model uses a bidirectional long short-term memory-based architecture, allowing for the sequential context of codon usage in genes to be learned. Our tool can predict synonymous codons for synthetic genes toward optimal expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>.

ICOR is shown to improve the codon adaptation index by 41.69% and 17.25% compared to the original and Genscript’s GenSmart-optimized sequences, respectively.

In this study, we used genomic sequences of 253 tomato accessions to investigate the evolution of deleterious mutations and genomic structural variants (SVs) through tomato domestication history. Specifically, we used phylogeny-based methods to identify deleterious mutations in the cultivated tomato as well as its closely related semi-wild and wild populations.

We also detected an increase in proportions of nonsynonymous and deleterious alleles (relative to synonymous and neutral nonsynonymous alleles, respectively) during the initial stage of tomato domestication in Ecuador, although the final stage of tomato domestication in Mexico did not seem to involve such an increase.

These cues however are multifarious, irregular or conflicting, changing both in time and space. Here we find that single cells utilize a molecular mechanism akin to a working memory, to generate persistent directional migration when signals are disrupted by temporally memorizing their position, while still remaining adaptive to spatial and temporal changes of the signal source. Using dynamical systems theory, we derive that these information processing capabilities are inherent for protein networks whose dynamics is maintained away from steady state through organization at criticality. We demonstrate experimentally using the Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling network, that the memory is maintained in the prolonged activity of the receptor via a slow-escaping remnant, a dynamical ghost of the attractor of the polarized signaling state, that further results in memory in migration. As this state is metastable, it also enables continuous adaptation of the migration direction when the signals vary in space and time. We therefore show that cells implement real-time computations without stable-states to navigate in changing chemoattractant fields by memorizing position of disrupted signals while maintaining sensitivity to novel chemical cues.</p>",2021-11-12

We show that this stabilisation takes place by a dynamic binding mechanism, in which both the small molecule and the Aβ42 peptide remain disordered. This disordered binding mechanism involves enthalpically favourable local π-stacking interactions coupled with entropically advantageous global effects. These results indicate that small molecules can stabilise disordered proteins in their native states through transient non-specific interactions that provide enthalpic gain while simultaneously increasing the conformational entropy of the proteins.</p>",2021-11-11

We find that the injected dsRNA is directly transmitted into the egg and persists throughout embryogenesis.  Despite this depletion of dsRNA from the mother, we show that strong pRNAi can persist for months before waning at strain-specific rates.  In seeking the receptor proteins for cellular uptake of long dsRNA into the egg, we lastly present a phylogenomics profiling approach to ascertain macroevolutionary distributions of candidate proteins.  We demonstrate a visualization strategy based on taxonomically hierarchical assessment of orthology clustering data to rapidly assess gene age and copy number changes, refined by several lines of sequence-based evidence.  We use this approach to document repeated losses of SID-1-like channel proteins in the arthropods, including wholesale loss in the Heteroptera (true bugs), which are nonetheless highly sensitive to pRNAi.

The biophysical characteristic of Kv channels can be matched to the needs of different neurons by forming homotetrameric or heterotetrameric channels within one of four subfamilies. The cytoplasmic tetramerization (T1) domain plays a major role in dictating the compatibility of different Kv subunits. The only Kv subfamily missing a representative structure of the T1 domain is the Kv2 family. We used X-ray crystallography to solve the structure of the human Kv2.1 T1 domain. The structure is similar to other T1 domains but surprisingly formed a pentamer instead of a tetramer. In solution the Kv2.1 T1 domain also formed a pentamer as determined with in-line SEC-MALS-SAXS and negative stain EM. The Kv2.1 T1-T1 interface involves electrostatic interactions including a salt bridge formed by the negative charges in a previously described CDD motif, and inter-subunit coordination of zinc. We show that zinc binding is important for stability. In conclusion, the Kv2.1 T1 domain behaves differently from the other Kv T1 domains which may reflect the versatility of Kv2.1, the only Kv subfamily that can assemble with the regulatory KvS subunits and scaffold ER-plasma membrane contacts.</p>",2021-11-09

In this study, we conducted a quantitative structure-activity analysis of three alternative tetrapeptide analogs that differed with respect to aromatic side chain composition and sequence register, benchmarked against SS-31. Using NMR and molecular dynamics approaches, we obtained the first structural models for this class of compounds, showing that all analogs except for SS-31 form compact reverse turn conformations in the membrane-bound state. All peptide analogs bound cardiolipin-containing membranes, yet they had significant differences in equilibrium binding behavior and membrane interactions. Notably, the analogs had markedly different effects on membrane surface charge, supporting a mechanism in which modulation of membrane electrostatics is a key feature of their mechanism of action. All peptide analogs preserved survival and energy metabolism more effectively than SS-31 in cell stress models. Within our peptide set, the analog containing tryptophan side chains, SPN10, had the strongest impact on most membrane properties and showed greatest efficacy in cell culture studies. Taken together, these results show that side chain composition and register strongly influence the activity of these mitochondria-targeted peptides.

The observed waning of vaccine efficacy over time suggests that booster doses may be required to maintain population immunity especially in the most vulnerable groups. Here, using data and models for England, we consider the dynamics of COVID-19 over a two-year time-frame, and the role that booster vaccinations can play in mitigating the worst effects. We find that boosters are necessary to suppress the imminent wave of infections that would be generated by waning vaccine efficacy. Projecting further into the future, the optimal deployment of boosters is highly sensitive to their long-term action. If protection from boosters wanes slowly (akin to protection following infection) then a single booster dose to the over 50s may be all that is needed over the next two-years. However, if protection wanes more rapidly (akin to protection following second dose vaccination) then annual or even biannual boosters are required to limit subsequent epidemic peaks an reduce the pressure on public health services.</p>",2021-11-09

A comprehensive characterization of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between SARS-CoV-2 and human cells is a key to understanding the infection and preventing the disease. Here we present a novel approach to predict virus-host PPIs by multi-label machine learning classifiers of random forests and XGBoost using amino acid composition profiles of virus and human proteins. Our models harness a large-scale database of Viruses.STRING with &gt;80,000 virus-host PPIs along with evidence scores for multi-level evidence prediction, which is distinct from predicting binary interactions in previous studies. Our multi-label classifiers are based on 5 evidence levels binned from evidence scores. Our best model of XGBoost achieves 74% AUC and 68% accuracy on average in 10-fold cross validation. The most important amino acids are cysteine and histidine. In addition, our model predicts experimental PPIs with higher evidence level than text mining-based PPIs. We then predict evidence levels of ~2,000 SARS-CoV-2 virus-human PPIs from public experimental proteomics data. Interactions with SARS-CoV-2 Nsp7b show high evidence. We also predict evidence levels of all pairwise PPIs of ~550,000 between the SARS-CoV-2 and human proteomes to provide a draft virus-host interactome landscape for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans in a comprehensive and unbiased way in silico. Most human proteins from 140 highest evidence predictions interact with SARS-CoV-2 Nsp7, Nsp1, and ORF14, with significant enrichment in the top 2 pathways of vascular smooth muscle contraction (CALD1, NPR2, CALML3) and Myc targets (CBX3, PES1).

To address this lacuna, we constructed a novel large-scale, biophysically principled model of the subthalamopallidal [STN-Globus Pallidus externus (GPe)] network, and examined the mechanisms that modulate theta power and spiking in response to cortical input. Simulations confirmed that theta power does not emerge from intrinsic network dynamics but is robustly elicited in response to cortical input as burst events representing action selection dynamics. Rhythmic burst events of multiple cortical populations, representing a state of conflict where cortical motor plans vacillate in the theta range, led to prolonged STN theta and increased spiking, consistent with empirical literature. Notably, theta band signaling required NMDA, but not AMPA, currents, which were in turn related to a triphasic STN response characterized by spiking, silence and bursting periods. Finally, theta band resonance was also strongly modulated by architectural connectivity, with maximal theta arising when multiple cortical populations project to individual STN “conflict detector” units, due to an NMDA-dependent supralinear response.

Interestingly, CEP170, NUCKS1, and ZC3H11A cooperate to elicit oncogenic effects by collectively impairing the tumor suppressor activity of 8 miRNAs on several pro-metastatic target genes. Finally, this complex chromosome 1q ceRNA network is evident in other cancer types, suggesting ceRNA network deregulation is a common driver of cancer progression.</p>",2021-11-14

(ii) use of mature mRNA data, instead of nascent data, significantly increases the errors in parameter estimation and can mistakenly classify a gene as non-bursting. Furthermore, we show how to correctly adjust for measurement noise in sm-FISH at low nascent transcript numbers.

Deviations in the maturation of thalamocortical connectivity are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. There is a lack of early biomarkers to detect and localize neuromaturational deviations, which can be overcome with mapping through high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) assessed in sleep. Specifically, slow waves and spindles in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep are generated by the thalamocortical system, and their characteristics, slow wave slope and spindle density, are closely related to neuroplasticity and learning. Recent studies further suggest that information processing during sleep underlying sleep-dependent learning is promoted by the temporal coupling of slow waves and spindles, yet slow wave-spindle coupling remains unexplored in infancy. Thus, we evaluated three potential biomarkers: 1) slow wave slope, 2) spindle density, and 3) the temporal coupling of slow waves with spindles. We use hdEEG to first examine the occurrence and spatial distribution of these three EEG features in healthy infants and second to evaluate a predictive relationship with later behavioral outcomes. We report four key findings: First, infants’ EEG features appear locally: slow wave slope is maximal in occipital and frontal areas, whereas spindle density is most pronounced frontocentrally. Second, slow waves and spindles are temporally coupled in infancy, with maximal coupling strength in the occipital areas of the brain. Third, slow wave slope, spindle density, and slow wave-spindle coupling are not associated with concurrent behavioral status (6 months). Fourth, spindle density in central and frontocentral regions at age 6 months predicts later behavioral outcomes at 12 and 24 months. Neither slow wave slope nor slow wave-spindle coupling predict behavioral development. Our results propose spindle density as an early EEG biomarker for identifying thalamocortical maturation, which can potentially be used for early diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders in infants. These findings are complemented by our companion paper that demonstrates the linkage of spindle density to infant nighttime movement, framing the possible role of spindles in sensorimotor microcircuitry development. Together, our studies suggest that early sleep habits, thalamocortical maturation, and behavioral outcome are closely interwoven.

This study is a systematic evaluation of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in 3D heterotypic coculture models of PDAC with varying ratios of patient derived PCAFs that simulate heterogenous PDAC tumors with increasing stromal content. The efficacy of antibody-targeted PDT (photoimmunotherapy; PIT) using cetuximab photoimmunoconjugates (PICs) of benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD) is contrasted with that of liposomal BPD (Visudyne®), which is currently in PDT clinical trials for PDAC. We demonstrate that both Visudyne®-PDT and PIT were effective in heterotypic PDAC 3D spheroids with a low stromal content. However, as the stromal content increases above 50% in the 3D spheroids, the efficacy of Visudyne®-PDT is reduced by up to 10-fold, while PIT retains its efficacy. PIT was found to be 10-fold, 19-fold and 14-fold more phototoxic in spheroids with 50%, 75% and 90% PCAFs, respectively, as compared to Visudyne®-PDT. This marked difference in efficacy is attributed to the ability of PICs to penetrate and distribute within spheroids with a higher stromal content, whereas Visudyne® is restricted to the spheroid periphery. This study thus demonstrates how the stromal content in PDAC spheroids directly impacts their responsiveness to PDT and proposes PIT to be a highly suited treatment option for desmoplastic tumors with particularly high degrees of stromal content.</p>",2021-11-10

Although a significant amount of work has been done to understand the healing process of tendons and to develop potential therapeutics for tendon regeneration, there is still a significant gap in terms of assessing the direct effects of therapeutics on the functional and material quality specifically of the scar tissue, and thus, on the overall tendon healing process. In this study, we focused on characterizing the mechanical properties of only the scar tissue in flexor digitorum longus (FDL) tendons during the proliferative and remodeling healing phases and comparing these properties with the mechanical properties of the composite healing tissue. Our method was sensitive enough to identify significant differences in structural and material properties between the scar and tendon-scar composite tissues. To account for possible inaccuracies due to the small aspect ratio of scar tissue, we also applied inverse finite element analysis (iFEA) to compute mechanical properties based on simulated tests with accurate specimen geometries and boundary conditions. We found that the scar tissue linear tangent moduli calculated from iFEA were not significantly different from those calculated experimentally at all healing timepoints, validating our experimental findings, and suggesting the assumptions in our experimental calculations were accurate. Taken together, this study first demonstrates that due to the presence of uninjured stubs, testing composite healing tendons without isolating the scar tissue overestimates the material properties of the scar itself. Second, our scar isolation method promises to enable more direct assessment of how different treatment regimens (e.g., cellular ablation, biomechanical and/or biochemical stimuli, tissue engineered scaffolds) affect scar tissue function and material quality in multiple different types of tendons.</p>",2021-11-11

In particular, previous research has shown that the soil community often generates frequency-dependent feedback loops among plants that can either destabilize species interactions, or generate stabilizing niche differences that promote species coexistence. However, recent insights from modern coexistence theory have shown that microbial effects on plant coexistence depend not only on these stabilizing or destabilizing effects, but also on the degree to which they generate competitive fitness differences. While many previous experiments have generated the data necessary for evaluating microbially mediated fitness differences, these effects have rarely been quantified in the literature. Here we present a meta-analysis of data from 50 studies, which we used to quantify the microbially mediated (de)stabilization and fitness differences derived from a classic plant-soil feedback model. Across 518 pairwise comparisons, we found that soil microbes generated both stabilization (or destabilization) and fitness differences, but also that the microbially mediated fitness differences dominated. As a consequence, if plants are otherwise equivalent competitors, the balance of soil microbe-generated (de)stabilization and fitness differences drives species exclusion much more frequently than coexistence or priority effects.

Cell-wide or input-specific adaptations can be induced by pharmacological or genetic manipulations of activity, and by sensory deprivation. Reactive functional changes caused by deafferentation may partially share mechanisms with HSP. Acute hippocampal slices constitute a suitable model to investigate relatively rapid (hours) pathway-specific modifications occurring after denervation and explore the underlying mechanisms. As Schaffer collaterals constitute a major glutamatergic input to CA1 pyramidal neurons, we conducted whole-cell recordings of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) to evaluate changes over 12 hours after slice preparation and CA3 dissection. We observed an increment in mEPSCs amplitude and a decrease in decay time, suggesting synaptic AMPA receptor upregulation and subunit content modifications. Sorting mEPSC by rise time, a correlate of synapse location along dendrites, revealed amplitude raises at two separate domains. A specific frequency increase was observed in the same domains and was accompanied by a global, unspecific raise. Amplitude and frequency increments were lower at sites initially more active, consistent with local compensatory processes. Transient preincubation with a specific Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor either blocked or occluded amplitude and frequency upregulation in different synapse populations. Results are consistent with the concurrent development of different known CaMKII-dependent HSP processes. Our observations support that deafferentation causes rapid and diverse compensations resembling classical slow forms of adaptation to inactivity.

Trait heritability, which summarizes the relative importance of genetic effects, is estimated at the intraspecific level, but theory predicts that heritability could influence long-term evolution of quantitative traits. The phylogenetic signal concept bears resemblance to heritability and it has often been called species-level heritability. Under certain conditions, such as trait neutrality or contribution to phylogenesis, within-species heritability and between-species phylogenetic signal should be correlated. Here, we investigate the potential relationship between these two concepts by examining the evolution of multiple morphological traits for which heritability has been estimated in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Specifically, we analysed 42 morphological traits in both sexes on a phylogeny inferred from 22 nuclear genes for nine species of the <italic>melanogaster</italic> subgroup.

Pigmentation traits showed the strongest concordance with the phylogeny, but no correlation was found between phylogenetic signal and heritability estimates mined from the literature. We obtained data for multiple climatic variables inferred from the geographical distribution of each species. Phylogenetic regression of quantitative traits on climatic variables showed a significantly positive correlation with heritability. Convergent selection, the response to which depends on the trait heritability, may have led to the null association between phylogenetic signal and heritability for morphological traits in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

Because oxygen shortage leads to a reduction in cellular energy production, all eukaryotes studied so far conserve energy by suppressing their metabolism. However, the molecular physiology of animals that naturally and repeatedly experience anoxia is underexplored. One such animal is the marine nematode Laxus oneistus. It thrives, invariably coated by its sulfur-oxidizing symbiont Candidatus Thiosymbion oneisti, in anoxic sulfidic or hypoxic sand. Here, transcriptomics and proteomics showed that, whether in anoxia or not, L. oneistus mostly expressed genes involved in ubiquitination, energy generation, oxidative stress response, immune response, development, and translation. Importantly, ubiquitination genes were also upregulated when the nematode was subjected to anoxic sulfidic conditions, together with genes involved in autophagy, detoxification and ribosome biogenesis. We hypothesize that these degradation pathways were induced to recycle damaged cellular components (mitochondria) and misfolded proteins into nutrients. Remarkably, when L. oneistus was subjected to anoxic sulfidic conditions, lectin and mucin genes were also upregulated, potentially to promote the attachment of its thiotrophic symbiont. Furthermore, the nematode appeared to survive oxygen deprivation by using an alternative electron carrier (rhodoquinone) and acceptor (fumarate), to rewire the electron transfer chain. On the other hand, under hypoxia, genes involved in costly processes (e.g., amino acid biosynthesis, development, feeding, mating) were upregulated, together with the worm's Toll-like innate immunity pathway and several immune effectors (e.g., Bacterial Permeability Increasing proteins, fungicides). In conclusion, we hypothesize that, in anoxic sulfidic sand, L. oneistus upregulates degradation processes, rewires oxidative phosphorylation and by reinforces its coat of bacterial sulfur-oxidizers. In upper sand layers, instead, it appears to produce broad-range antimicrobials and to exploit oxygen for biosynthesis and development.</p>",2021-11-12

Using multiple functional localizers, we discovered regions in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) that were selectively involved in computing object-centered part relations. These regions exhibited task-dependent functional connectivity with ventral cortex, and were distinct from other dorsal regions, such as those representing allocentric relations, 3D shape, and tools. In a subsequent experiment, we found that the multivariate response of posterior IPS, defined on the basis of part-relations, could be used to decode object category at levels comparable to ventral object regions.

As such, deficits in sleep can result in a myriad of psychological and physical health issues. However, the mechanisms underlying the induction of sleep are relatively unknown. Interestingly, general anesthetics cause unconsciousness by positively modulating GABA-A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs). Based on this observation, it is hypothesized that GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs play a critical role in modulating circuits involved in sleep to promote unconsciousness. Recently, the lateral habenula (LHb) has been demonstrated to play a role in sleep physiology and sedation. Specifically, propofol has been shown to excite LHb neurons to promote sedation. However, the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Here, we utilize whole-cell voltage and current clamp recordings from LHb neurons obtained from 8-10 week old male mice to determine the physiological mechanisms for this phenomenon. We show that bath application of 1.5μM propofol is sufficient to increase LHb neuronal excitability involving synaptic transmission, but not through modulation of intrinsic properties. Additionally, although there is increased LHb neuronal excitability, GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs localized postsynaptically on LHb neurons are still responsive to propofol, as indicated by an increase in the decay time. Lastly, we find that propofol increases the synaptic drive onto LHb neurons involving enhanced presynaptic release of both glutamate and GABA. However, the greatest contributor to the potentiated synaptic drive is the increased release of glutamate which shifts the balance of synaptic transmission towards greater excitation. Taken together, this study is the first to identify the physiological basis for why LHb neurons are excited by propofol, rather than inhibited, and as a result promote sedation.</p>",2021-11-08

Here, we define an Mtb-orchestrated modulation of the ubiquitination mechanism of lipid accumulation markers to enhance lipid accretion during infection. We find that Mtb infection represses the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, ITCH, resulting in the sustenance of key lipid accrual molecules viz. ADRP and CD36, that are otherwise targeted by ITCH for proteasomal degradation. In line, overexpressing ITCH in Mtb-infected cells was found to suppress Mtb-induced lipid accumulation. Molecular analyses including loss-of-function and ChIP assays demonstrated a role for the concerted action of the transcription factor YY1 and the arginine methyl transferase PRMT5 in restricting the expression of <italic>Itch</italic> gene by conferring repressive symmetrical H4R3me2 marks on its promoter. Consequently, siRNA-mediated depletion of YY1 or PRMT5 rescued ITCH expression, thereby compromising the levels of Mtb-induced ADRP and CD36 and limiting FM formation during infection.

Furthermore, alignment-free methods present the only option for some emerging forms of data such as genome skims, which cannot be assembled. Despite the appeal, alignment-free methods have not been competitive with alignment-based methods in terms of accuracy. One limitation of alignment-free methods is that they typically rely on simplified models of sequence evolution such as Jukes-Cantor. It is possible to compute pairwise distances under more complex models by computing frequencies of base substitutions provided that these quantities can be estimated in the alignment-free setting. A particular limitation is that for many forms of genome-wide data, which arguably present the best use case for alignment-free methods, the strand of DNA sequences is unknown. Under such conditions, the so-called no-strand bias models are the most complex models that can be used. Here, we show how to calculate distances under a no-strain bias restriction of the General Time Reversible (GTR) model called TK4 without relying on alignments. The method relies on replacing letters in the input sequences, and subsequent computation of Jaccard indices between k-mer sets. For the method to work on large genomes, we also need to compute the number of k-mer mismatches after replacement due to random chance. We show in simulation that these alignment-free distances can be highly accurate when genomes evolve under the assumed models, and we examine the effectiveness of the method on real genomic data.</p>",2021-11-13

Physiological changes (e.g., plasma protein concentration, liver size, CP450 expression, hepatic blood flow) and portal vein shunt were incorporated into the LD model. The changes were implemented by using the Child-Pugh (CP) classification system. DEX was qualified using clinical data in healthy adults for both oral (PO) and intravenous (IV) administrations and similarly propranolol (PRO) and midazolam (MDZ) were qualified with PO and IV clinical data in healthy and LD adults. The qualified model was subsequently used to simulate a 6 mg PO and 20 mg IV dose of DEX in patients with varying degrees of LD, with and without shunting. The PBPK model was successfully qualified across DEX, MDZ and PRO. In contrast to healthy adults, the simulated systemic clearance of DEX decreased (35% - 60%) and the plasma concentrations increased (170% - 400%) in patients with LD. Moreover, at higher doses of DEX, the AUC ratio between healthy/LD individuals remained comparable to lower doses. The exposure of DEX in different stages of LD was predicted through PBPK modelling, providing a rational framework to predict PK in complex clinical scenarios related to COVID-19. Model simulations suggest dose adjustments of DEX in LD patients are not necessary considering the low dose administered in the COVID-19 protocol.</p>",2021-11-10

However, direct comparison of datasets derived from heterogeneous experimental conditions is not possible and their integration requires the application of specific meta-analysis techniques. The transcriptional response to hypoxia has been the focus of intense research due to its central role in tissue homeostasis and in prevalent diseases. Accordingly, a large number of studies have determined the gene expression profile of hypoxic cells. Yet, in spite of this wealth of information, little effort have been done to integrate these dataset to produce a robust hypoxic signature. Results: We applied a formal meta-analysis procedure to a dataset comprising 425 RNAseq samples derived from 42 individual studies including 33 different cell types, to derive a pooled estimate of the effect of hypoxia on gene expression. This approach revealed that a large proportion of the transcriptome (8556 genes out of 20888) is significantly regulated by hypoxia. However, only a small fraction of the differentially expressed genes (1265 genes, 15%) show an effect size that, according to comparisons to gene pathways known to be regulated by hypoxia, is likely to be biologically relevant. By focusing on genes ubiquitously expressed we identified a signature of 291 genes robustly and consistently regulated by hypoxia. Finally, by a applying a moderator analysis we found that endothelial cells show a characteristic gene expression pattern that is significantly different from other cell types. Conclusion: By the application of a formal meta-analysis to hypoxic gene profiles, we have developed a robust gene signature that characterizes the transcriptomic response to low oxygen. In addition to identifying a universal set of hypoxia-responsive genes, we found a set of genes whose regulation is cell-type specific and suggest a unique metabolic response of endothelial cells to reduced oxygen tension.</p>",2021-11-14

We used this assembly to understand how O. amberensis has adapted to the harsh Southern Ocean and compared it to another group of Antarctic fishes: the notothenioids. We showed that from a genome-wide perspective, selection has largely acted on different targets in eelpouts relative to notothenioids.

There is currently no structure available for the full-length MeCP2 in any of the databases, and only the structure of its MBD domain has been solved. We used this structure to build a full-length model of MeCP2 by completing the rest of the protein via <italic>ab initio</italic> modelling. Using a combination of all-atom and coarse-grained simulations, we characterized its structure and dynamics as well as the conformational space sampled by the ID and TRD domains in the absence of the rest of the protein. The present work is the first computational study of the full-length protein. Two main conformations were sampled in the coarse-grained simulations: a globular structure similar to the one observed in the all-atom force field and a two-globule conformation. Our all-atom model is in good agreement with the available experimental data, predicting amino acid W104 to be buried, amino acids R111 and R133 to be solvent accessible, and having 4.1% of α-helix content, compared to the 4% found experimentally. Finally, we compared the model predicted by AlphaFold to our Modeller model. The model was not stable in water and underwent further folding. Together, these simulations provide a detailed (if perhaps incomplete) conformational ensemble of the full-length MeCP2, which is compatible with experimental data and can be the basis of further studies, e.g., on mutants of the protein or its interactions with its biological partners.</p>",2021-11-08

Previously, we developed a light-gated immune receptor to probe the role of ligand kinetics in T cell antigen signaling. We found significant kinetic proofreading at the level of the signaling lipid diacylglycerol (DAG) but lacked the ability to determine where the multiple signaling steps required for kinetic discrimination originate in the upstream signaling cascade (Tischer and Weiner, 2019). Here we uncover where kinetic proofreading is executed by adapting our optogenetic system for robust activation of early signaling events. We find the strength of kinetic proofreading progressively increases from Zap70 recruitment to LAT clustering to downstream DAG generation. These data suggest a distributed kinetic proofreading mechanism, with proofreading steps both at the receptor and at downstream signaling events. Leveraging the ability of our system to rapidly disengage ligand binding, we measure slower reset rates for downstream signaling events.

Envelope formation compacted the underlying lattice, whereas lattice extension induced tau-envelope disassembly.

Models of cortical alpha rhythms (8 - 12 Hz) and their impact in visual sensory processing have been at the forefront of this effort, with the Jansen-Rit being one of the more popular models in this domain. The Jansen-Rit model, however, fails in reproducing key physiological observations including the level of inputs that cortical neurons receive and their responses to visual transients. To address these issues we generated a neural mass model that complies better with synaptic mediated dynamics, intrinsic alpha behavior, and produces realistic responses. The model is robust to many changes in parameter values but critically depends on the ratio of excitation to inhibition, producing response transients whose features are dependent on this ratio and alpha phase and power. The model is sufficiently flexible so as to be able to easily replicate the range of low frequency oscillations observed in different studies. Consistent with experimental observations, we find phase-dependent response dynamics to both visual and electrical stimulation using this model.

Moreover, it could lead us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of complex diseases and, subsequently, the discovery of new therapeutic targets. Given these challenges and benefits, it has become evident that a freely accessible and centralized platform for presenting gut microbiome interaction is essential to untangle the complexity and open multiple new paths and opportunities in disease- and drug-related research.

Reverse phase protein array (RPPA)-based analyses of &gt;110 total and phospho-proteins enabled the identification of sensitivities to standard, platinum-based as well as experimental, selumetinib-based therapy, and thereby the prediction of treatment-responder. Parallelized drug testing in OvCa PDM allowed functional validation of RPPA data and detection of on- and off-target treatment effects. Strikingly, clinical follow-up of corresponding patients confirmed significantly increased metastasis-free survival of identified carboplatin-responder.

To address these questions, we tested how hierarchical network interactions contribute to improvements in the performance of a visuo-spatial processing task by employing simultaneous PET/MR neuroimaging before and after a 4-week learning period. We combined functional PET with metabolic connectivity mapping (MCM) to infer directional interactions across brain regions and subsequently performed simulations to disentangle the role of functional network dynamics and glucose metabolism. As a result, learning altered the top-down regulation of the salience network onto the occipital cortex, with increases in MCM at resting-state and decreases during task execution. Accordingly, a higher divergence between resting-state and task-specific effects was associated with better cognitive performance, indicating that these adaptations are complementary and both required for successful skill learning. Simulations further showed that changes at resting-state were dependent on glucose metabolism, whereas those during task performance were driven by functional connectivity between salience and visual networks. Referring to previous work, we suggest that learning establishes a metabolically expensive skill engram at rest, whose retrieval serves for efficient task execution by minimizing prediction errors between neuronal representations of brain regions on different hierarchical levels.</p>",2021-11-12

We showed that the bacterial and viral communities associated with these White Sea sponges are species-specific and different from the surrounding water. Extensive mining of bacterial antiphage defense systems in the metagenomes revealed a variety of defense mechanisms. The abundance of defense systems was comparable in the metagenomes of the sponges and the surrounding water, thus distinguishing the White Sea sponges from those inhabiting the tropical seas. We developed a network-based approach for the combined analysis of CRISPR-spacers and protospacers.

Genetic mouse models require breeding efforts which are time-consuming and costly. To establish a new non-genetic model of inducible metabolic risk factors mimicking hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, or both and allowing to detect phenotypic differences dependent on the metabolic stressor(s). Methods and Results: Wild type mice were injected with gain-of-function PCSK9D377Y (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) mutant adeno-associated viral particles (AAV) and streptozotocin and fed either a high-fat diet (HFD) or high-cholesterol/high fat-diet (Paigen diet, PD). Combined hyperlipidemic and hyperglycemic (HGHCi) mice, but not hyperlipidemia (HCi) alone, display characteristic features of accelerated atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic plaques of HGHCi animals were larger, showed a less stable phenotype, contained more macrophages and less smooth muscle cells. These findings were observed both at early (12 weeks) and late (20 weeks) time points on both HFD or PD diet. Differences between the HGHCi and HCi model were confirmed using RNAseq analysis revealing that significantly more genes are dysregulated in mice with combined hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia as compared to the hyperlipidemia only group. The HGHCi-associated genes were related to pathways regulating inflammation, cellular metabolism and collagen degradation. PD accelerates atherosclerosis in mice and shows plaque formation already after 8 weeks, therefore, representing a fast direct inducible hyperglycemic atherosclerosis model. Conclusion: We established a non-genetic inducible mouse model allowing comparative analyses of atherosclerosis in HCi and HGHCi conditions and its modification by diet, allowing analyses of multiple metabolic hits in mice.</p>",2021-11-12

Other studies have reported that long-term antibiotic therapy in multiple sclerosis patients reduces relapse rate and gadolinium enhancing lesions as well as improves measures of disability. In addition, antibiotic treatment has been shown to ameliorate disease in the EAE mouse model of multiple sclerosis.

Hence, it remains unclear how the gut microbiota can be targeted for therapeutic purposes in multiple sclerosis patients. Here we characterized the gut microbiome of untreated and vancomycin treated EAE mice over time to identify bacteria with neuroimmunomodulatory potential. We observed alterations in the gut microbiota composition following EAE induction. We found that vancomycin treatment ameliorates EAE and that this protective effect is mediated via the microbiota. Notably, we observed increase abundance of bacteria known to be strong inducers of regulatory T cells including members of Clostridium clusters XIVa and XVIII in vancomycin-treated mice during the presymptomatic phase of EAE as well as at disease peak.

How tumor-induced bone formation enhances PCa progression is not known. We have previously shown that PCa-induced bone originates from endothelial cells (EC) that have undergone endothelial-to-osteoblast (EC-to-OSB) transition by tumor-secreted BMP4. Here, we show that EC-to-OSB transition leads to changes in the tumor microenvironment that increases the metastatic potential of PCa cells. We found that conditioned medium (CM) from EC-OSB hybrid cells increases the migration, invasion and survival of PC3-mm2 and C4-2B4 PCa cells. Quantitative mass spectrometry (iTRAQ) identified Tenascin C (TNC) as one of the major proteins secreted from EC-OSB hybrid cells. TNC expression in tumor-induced osteoblasts was confirmed by immunohistochemistry of MDA-PCa118b xenograft and human bone metastasis specimens. Mechanistically, BMP4 increases TNC expression in EC-OSB cells through the Smad1-Notch/Hey1 pathway. How TNC promotes PCa metastasis was next interrogated by in vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro studies showed that a TNC neutralizing antibody inhibits EC-OSB-CM-mediated PCa cell migration and survival. TNC knockdown decreased, while addition of recombinant TNC or TNC overexpression increased migration and anchorage-independent growth of PC3 or C4-2b cells. When injected orthotopically, PC3-mm2-shTNC clones decreased metastasis to bone, while C4-2b-TNC overexpressing cells increased metastasis to lymph nodes. TNC enhances PCa cell migration through α5β1 integrin-mediated YAP/TAZ inhibition. These studies elucidate that tumor-induced stromal reprogramming generates TNC that enhances PCa metastasis and suggest that TNC may be a target for PCa therapy.</p>",2021-11-08

At a systems level, however, the underlying neural circuitry is not well defined. Rodent fear conditioning (FC) provides a translational model to study the networks underlying associative memory retrieval. In the current study, functional connectivity among regions related to the cue associative fear network were investigated using functional ultrasound (fUS), a novel imaging technique with great potential for detecting regional neural activity through cerebral blood flow. Behavioral fear expression and fUS imaging were performed one and thirty-one days after FC to assess recent and remote memory recall. Cue-evoked increases in functional connectivity were detected throughout the amygdala, with the lateral (LA) and central (CeA) amygdalar nuclei emerging as major hubs of connectivity, though CeA connectivity was reduced during remote recall. The hippocampus and sensory cortical regions displayed heightened connectivity with the LA during remote recall, whereas interconnectivity between the primary auditory cortex and temporal association areas was reduced. Subregions of the prefrontal cortex exhibited variable connectivity changes, where prelimbic connectivity with the amygdala was refined while specific connections between the infralimbic cortex and amygdalar subregions emerged during remote memory retrieval. Moreover, freezing behavior positively correlated with functional connectivity between hubs of the associative fear network, suggesting that emotional response intensity reflected the strength of the cue-evoked functional network. Overall, our data provide evidence of the functionality of fUS imaging to investigate the neural dynamics of memory encoding and retrieval, applicable in the development of innovative treatments for affective disorders.</p>",2021-11-14

Cognitive psychology suggests that cognitive control mechanisms play a key role when facing such complex task conditions. However, in value-based decision-making, it still remains unclear to what extent cognitive control mechanisms become essential when the task condition is complex. In this study, we investigated decision-making behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms using a multifactor gambling task where participants simultaneously considered probability and delay. Decision-making behavior in the multifactor task was modulated by both probability and delay. The behavioral effect of probability was stronger than delay, consistent with previous studies. Furthermore, in a subset of conditions that recruited fronto-parietal activations, reaction times were paradoxically elongated despite lower probabilistic uncertainty. Notably, such a reaction time elongation did not occur in control tasks involving single factors. Meta-analysis of brain activations suggested an association between the paradoxical increase of reaction time and strategy switching.
