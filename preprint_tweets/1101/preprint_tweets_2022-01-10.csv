Early reports have also suggested that Omicron may result in less severe clinical disease in humans. Here we show that Omicron is less pathogenic than prior SARS-CoV-2 variants in Syrian golden hamsters. Infection of hamsters with the SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020, Alpha, Beta, or Delta strains led to 4-10% weight loss by day 4 and 10-17% weight loss by day 6, as expected<sup>2,3</sup>. In contrast, infection of hamsters with two different Omicron challenge stocks did not result in any detectable weight loss, even at high challenge doses. Omicron infection still led to substantial viral replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts and pulmonary pathology, but with a trend towards higher viral loads in nasal turbinates and lower viral loads in lung parenchyma compared with WA1/2020 infection. These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant may result in more robust upper respiratory tract infection but less severe lower respiratory tract clinical disease compared with prior SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>",2022-01-03

Invasion of the brain by SARS-CoV-2 has been observed in humans and is postulated to be involved in post COVID condition. Brain infection is particularly pronounced in the K18-<italic>hACE2</italic> mouse model of COVID-19. Here, we show that treatment of K18-<italic>hACE2</italic> mice with melatonin and two melatonin-derived marketed drugs, agomelatine and ramelteon, prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry in the brain thereby reducing virus-induced damage of small cerebral vessels, immune cell infiltration and brain inflammation. Brain entry of SARS-CoV-2 through endothelial cells is prevented by melatonin through allosteric binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which interferes with the cell entry receptor function of ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2. Our findings open new perspectives for the repurposing of melatonergic drugs in the prevention of brain infection by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19-related long-term neurological symptoms.</p>",2022-01-03

A public class of IGHV3-53-using SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies<sup>5,6</sup> typically fails to neutralize variants carrying mutations in the receptor-binding motif<sup>7–11</sup>, including Omicron. As antibodies from this class are likely elicited in most people following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination, their subsequent affinity maturation is of particular interest. Here, we isolated IGHV3-53-using antibodies from an individual seven months after infection and identified several antibodies capable of broad and potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, extending to Omicron without loss of potency. By introducing select somatic hypermutations into a germline-reverted form of one such antibody, CAB-A17, we demonstrate the potential for commonly elicited antibodies to develop broad cross-neutralization through affinity maturation. Further, we resolved the structure of CAB-A17 Fab in complex with Omicron spike at an overall resolution of 2.6 Å by cryo-electron microscopy and defined the structural basis for this breadth. Thus, public SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies can, without modified spike vaccines, mature to cross-neutralize exceptionally antigenically diverged SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>",2022-01-04

It has been demonstrated that Omicron’s high number of Spike mutations lead to partial immune evasion from even polyclonal antibody responses, allowing frequent re-infection and vaccine breakthroughs. However, it seems unlikely these antigenic differences alone explain its rapid growth; here we show Omicron replicates rapidly in human primary airway cultures, more so even than the previously dominant variant of concern, Delta. Omicron Spike continues to use human ACE2 as its primary receptor, to which it binds more strongly than other variants. Omicron Spike mediates enhanced entry into cells expressing several different animal ACE2s, including various domestic avian species, horseshoe bats and mice suggesting it has an increased propensity for reverse zoonosis and is more likely than previous variants to establish an animal reservoir of SARS-CoV-2. Unlike other SARS-CoV-2 variants, however, Omicron Spike has a diminished ability to induce syncytia formation. Furthermore, Omicron is capable of efficiently entering cells in a TMPRSS2-independent manner, via the endosomal route. We posit this enables Omicron to infect a greater number of cells in the respiratory epithelium, allowing it to be more infectious at lower exposure doses, and resulting in enhanced intrinsic transmissibility.</p>",2022-01-03

Modern scientific discovery relies on making comparisons between new maps (e.g. task activations, group structural differences) and these reference maps. Although recent data sharing initiatives have increased the accessibility of such brain maps, data are often shared in disparate coordinate systems (or ``spaces''), precluding systematic and accurate comparisons among them. Here we introduce the neuromaps toolbox, an open-access software package for accessing, transforming, and analyzing structural and functional brain annotations. We implement two registration frameworks to generate high-quality transformations between four standard coordinate systems commonly used in neuroimaging research. The initial release of the toolbox features &gt;40 curated reference maps and biological ontologies of the human brain, including maps of gene expression, neurotransmitter receptors, metabolism, neurophysiological oscillations, developmental and evolutionary expansion, functional hierarchy, individual functional variability, and cognitive specialization. Robust quantitative assessment of map-to-map similarity is enabled via a suite of spatial autocorrelation-preserving null models.

Here, we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of human CCAN. We highlight unique features such as the pseudo GTPase CENP-M and report how a crucial CENP-C motif binds the CENP-LN complex. The CCAN structure has also important implications for the mechanism of specific recognition of the CENP-A nucleosome. A supported model depicts the interaction as fuzzy and identifies the disordered CCAN subunit CENP-C as only determinant of specificity.

In most cases these domains are derived from native immune receptors, composed of signaling motif combinations selected by evolution. To explore if non-natural combinations of signaling motifs could drive novel cell fates of interest, we constructed a library of CARs containing ∼2,300 synthetic costimulatory domains, built from combinations of 13 peptide signaling motifs. The library produced CARs driving diverse fate outputs, which were sensitive to motif combinations and configurations. Neural networks trained to decode the combinatorial grammar of CAR signaling motifs allowed extraction of key design rules. For example, the non-native combination of TRAF- and PLCγ1-binding motifs was found to simultaneously enhance cytotoxicity and stemness, a clinically desirable phenotype associated with effective and durable tumor killing. The neural network accurately predicts that addition of PLCγ1-binding motifs improves this phenotype when combined with TRAF-binding motifs, but not when combined with other immune signaling motifs (e.g. PI3K-or Grb2-binding motifs). This work shows how libraries built from the minimal building blocks of signaling, combined with machine learning, can efficiently guide engineering of receptors with desired phenotypes.</p><sec><title>Graphical Abstract</title><fig id=""ufig1"" position=""float"" fig-type=""figure"" orientation=""portrait""><graphic xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""474985v2_ufig1"" position=""float"" orientation=""portrait"" /></fig></sec>",2022-01-04

Knowledge about the burden and predictors could aid in their prevention and management. Most of the studies are from high-income countries and focus on severe cases. We did this study to estimate the prevalence and identify the characteristics and predictors of Long COVID among our patients. 
Methodology: We recruited adult (≥18 years) patients who were diagnosed as Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR) confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection and were either hospitalized or tested on outpatient basis.  Eligible participants were followed up telephonically after four weeks of diagnosis of SARS-COV-2 infection to collect data on sociodemographic, clinical history, vaccination history, Cycle threshold (Ct) values during diagnosis and other variables. Characteristic of Long COVID were elicited, and multivariable logistic regression was done to find the predictors of Long COVID. 
Results: We have analyzed 487 individual data with a median follow-up of 44 days (Inter quartile range (IQR): 39,47). Overall, Long COVID was reported by 29.2% (95% Confidence interval (CI): 25.3%,33.4%) participants. Prevalence of Long COVID among patients with mild/moderate disease (n = 415) was 23.4% (95% CI: 19.5%,27.7%) as compared to 62.5% (95% CI: 50.7%,73%) in severe/critical cases(n=72). The most common Long COVID symptom was fatigue (64.8%) followed by cough (32.4%). Statistically significant predictors of Long COVID were - Pre-existing medical conditions (Adjusted Odds ratio (aOR)=2.00, 95% CI: 1.16,3.44), having a more significant number of symptoms during acute phase of COVID-19 disease (aOR=11.24, 95% CI: 4.00,31.51), two doses of COVID-19 vaccination (aOR=2.32, 95% CI: 1.17,4.58), the severity of illness (aOR=5.71, 95% CI: 3.00,10.89) and being admitted to hospital (Odds ratio (OR)=3.89, 95% CI: 2.49,6.08).
Conclusion: A considerable proportion of COVID-19 cases reported Long COVID symptoms. More research is needed in Long COVID to objectively assess the symptoms and find the biological and radiological markers.</p>",2022-01-08

Gardner'}]","<p>The human visual ability to recognize objects and scenes is widely thought to rely on representations in category-selective regions of visual cortex. These representations could support object vision by specifically representing objects, or, more simply, by representing complex visual features regardless of the particular spatial arrangement needed to constitute real world objects. That is, by representing visual textures. To discriminate between these hypotheses, we leveraged an image synthesis approach that, unlike previous methods, provides independent control over the complexity and spatial arrangement of visual features. We found that human observers could easily detect a natural object among synthetic images with similar complex features that were spatially scrambled. However, observer models built from BOLD responses from category-selective regions, as well as a model of macaque inferotemporal cortex and Imagenet-trained deep convolutional neural networks, were all unable to identify the real object. This inability was not due to a lack of signal-to-noise, as all of these observer models could predict human performance in image categorization tasks. How then might these texture-like representations in category-selective regions support object perception? An image-specific readout from category-selective cortex yielded a representation that was more selective for natural feature arrangement, showing that the information necessary for object discrimination is available.

Contrarily, we demonstrate that observer models based on category-selective regions, models of macaque inferotemporal cortex and Imagenet-trained deep convolutional neural networks do not preferentially represent natural images, even while they are able to discriminate image categories. This suggests the need to reconceptualize the role of category-selective cortex as representing a basis set of complex texture-like features, useful for a myriad of visual behaviors.</p></sec>",2022-01-05

Organismal anatomy is not a collection of randomly assembled and independent ""parts"", but instead a set of dependent and hierarchically nested entities resulting from ontogeny and phylogeny. How do we make sense of these dependent and at times redundant characters? One promising approach is using ontologies---structured controlled vocabularies that summarize knowledge about different properties of anatomical entities, including developmental and structural dependencies. Here we assess whether the proximity of ontology-annotated characters within an ontology predicts evolutionary patterns. To do so, we measure phylogenetic information across characters and evaluate if it is hierarchically structured by ontological knowledge---in much the same way as phylogeny structures across-species diversity. We implement an approach to evaluate the Bayesian phylogenetic information (BPI) content and phylogenetic dissonance among ontology-annotated anatomical data subsets. We applied this to datasets representing two disparate animal groups: bees (Hexapoda: Hymenoptera: Apoidea, 209 chars) and characiform fishes (Actinopterygii: Ostariophysi: Characiformes, 463 chars). For bees, we find that BPI is not substantially structured by anatomy since dissonance is often high among morphologically related anatomical entities. For fishes, we find substantial information for two clusters of anatomical entities instantiating concepts from the jaws and branchial arch bones, but among-subset information decreases and dissonance increases substantially moving to higher-level subsets in the ontology. We further applied our approach to addressing particular evolutionary hypotheses with an example of morphological evolution in miniature fishes. While we show that ontology does indeed structure phylogenetic information, additional relationships and processes, such as convergence, likely play a substantial role in explaining BPI and dissonance, and merit future investigation. Our work demonstrates how complex morphological datasets can be interrogated with ontologies by allowing one to access how information is spread hierarchically across anatomical concepts, how congruent this information is, and what sorts of processes may structure it: phylogeny, development, or convergence.</p>",2022-01-06

Agos bind small RNAs (sRNAs) including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) to form the functional core of the RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC). The sRNA is used as a guide to target mRNAs containing either partially or fully complementary sequences, ultimately leading to down regulation of the corresponding proteins. It was previously shown that the kinase CK1α phosphorylates a cluster of residues in the eukaryotic insertion (EI) of Ago, leading to the alleviation of miRNA-mediated repression through an undetermined mechanism. We show that binding of miRNA-loaded human Ago2 to target RNA with complementarity to the seed and 3′ supplemental regions of the miRNA primes the EI for hierarchical phosphorylation by CK1α. The added negative charges electrostatically promote target release, freeing Ago to seek out additional targets once it is dephosphorylated.

For each group, participants were randomly assigned at 1:1 ratio to receive either a heterologous boost of NVSI-06-07 or a homologous booster dose of BBIBP-CorV. The primary outcome was to comparatively assess the immunogenicity between heterologous and homologous boosts at 14 and 28 days post-boosting immunization, by evaluation of the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of IgG and neutralizing antibodies as well as the corresponding seroconversion rate (≥4-fold rise in antibody titers). The secondary outcomes were the safety profile of the boosting strategies within 30 days post vaccination.

No vaccine-related serious adverse event (SAE) and no adverse events of special interest (AESI) were reported. 184 (20·47%) participants in the heterologous boost groups and 177 (19·64%) in the homologous boost groups reported at least one adverse reaction within 30 days. Most of the local and systemic adverse reactions reported were grades 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate), and there was no significant difference in the overall safety between heterologous and homologous boosts. Immunogenicity assays showed that the seroconversion rates in neutralizing antibodies against prototype SARS-CoV-2 elicited by heterologous boost were 89·96% - 97·52% on day 28 post-boosting vaccination, which was much higher than what was induced by homologous boost (36·80% - 81·75%). Similarly, in heterologous NVSI-06-07 booster groups, the neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs) against the prototype strain increased by 21·01 - 63·85 folds from baseline to 28 days post-boosting vaccination, whereas only 4·20 - 16·78 folds of increases were observed in homologous BBIBP-CorV booster group. For Omicron variant, the neutralizing antibody GMT elicited by the homologous boost of BBIBP-CorV was 37·91 (95%CI, 30·35-47·35), however, a significantly higher level of neutralizing antibodies with GMT 292·53 (95%CI, 222·81-384·07) was induced by the heterologous boost of NVSI-06-07, suggesting that it may serve as an effective boosting strategy combating the pandemic of Omicron. The similar results were obtained for other VOCs, including Alpha, Beta and Delta, in which the neutralizing response elicited by the heterologous boost was also significantly greater than that of the homologous boost. In the participants primed with BBIBP-CorV over 6 months, the largest increase in the neutralizing GMTs was obtained both in the heterologous and homologous boost groups, and thus the booster vaccination with over 6 months intervals was optimal.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Our findings indicated that the heterologous boost with NVSI-06-07 was safe, well-tolerated and immunogenic in adults primed with a full regimen of BBIBP-CorV.

The heterologous BBIBP-CorV/NVSI-06-07 prime-boosting vaccination may be valuable in preventing the pandemic of Omicron.

The adenovirus-vector and mRNA heterologous prime-boost vaccination was found to be well tolerated and immunogenic. In individuals primed with adenovirus-vector vaccine, mRNA booster vaccination led to greater immune response than homologous boost. However, varied results were obtained on whether heterologous boost was immunogenically superior to the homologous mRNA prime-boost vaccination. Besides that, A preprint trial in population previously immunized with inactivated vaccines (CoronaVac, Sinovac Biotech) showed that the heterologous boost with adenovirus-vector vaccine (Convidecia, CanSino Biologicals) was safe and induced higher level of live-virus neutralizing antibodies than by the homogeneous boost. A pilot study reported that boosting with BNT162b2 in individuals primed with two doses of inactivated vaccines (BBIBP-CorV) was significantly more immunogenic than homologous vaccination with two-dose of BNT162b2. In addition, a preprint paper demonstrated that heterologous boost of ZF2001, a recombinant protein subunit vaccine, after CoronaVac or BBIBP-CorV vaccination potently improved the immunogenicity. But only a small size of samples was tested in this study and the live-virus neutralization was not detected.

Its immunoreactivity is similar to that of homologous vaccination with BBIBP-CorV.

Due to no Omicron-specific vaccine available currently, the BBIBP-CorV/NVSI-06-07 heterologous prime-boost might serve as an effective strategy combating Omicron variant. Besides that, BBIBP-CorV has been widely inoculated in population, and thus further boosting vaccination with NVSI-06-07 is valuable in preventing the COVID-19 pandemic.

Niles'}, {'name': 'Juan Pablo Alperin'}]","<p>Review, promotion, and tenure (RPT) processes at universities typically assess candidates along three dimensions: research, teaching, and service. In recent years, some have argued for the inclusion of a controversial fourth criterion: collegiality. While collegiality plays a role in the morale and effectiveness of academic departments, it is amorphic and difficult to assess, and could be misused to stifle dissent or enforce homogeneity. Despite this, some institutions have opted to include this additional element in their RPT documents and processes, but it is unknown the extent of this practice and how it varies across institution type and disciplinary units. This study is based on two sets of data: survey data collected as part of a project that explored the publishing decisions of faculty and how these related to perceived importance in RPT processes, and 864 RPT documents collected from 129 universities from the United States and Canada. We analysed these RPT documents to determine the degree to which collegiality and related terms are mentioned, if they are defined, and if and how they may be assessed during the RPT process. Results show that when collegiality and related terms appear in these documents they are most often just briefly <italic>mentioned</italic>. It is less common for collegiality and related terms to be <italic>defined</italic> or <italic>assessed</italic> in RPT documents. Although the terms are <italic>mentioned</italic> across all types of institutions, there is a statistically significant difference in how prevalent they are at each. Collegiality is more commonly mentioned in the documents of doctoral research-focused universities (60%), than of master’s universities and colleges (31%) or baccalaureate colleges (15%). Results from the accompanying survey of faculty also support this finding: individuals from R-Types were more likely to perceive collegiality to be a factor in their RPT processes. We conclude that collegiality likely plays an important role in RPT processes, whether it is explicitly acknowledged in policies and guidelines or not, and point to several strategies in how it might be best incorporated in the assessment of academic careers.</p>",2022-01-05

Abscission is thus triggered by tension release, but how ICB tension is controlled is unknown. Here, we report that caveolae, which are known to control membrane tension upon mechanical stress in interphase cells, are located at the midbody, at the abscission site and at the ICB/cell interface in dividing cells. Functionally, the loss of caveolae delays ESCRT-III recruitment during cytokinesis and impairs abscission. This is the consequence of a 2-fold increase of ICB tension measured by laser ablation, associated with a local increase in myosin II activity at the ICB/cell interface. We thus propose that caveolae buffer membrane tension and limit contractibility at the ICB to promote ESCRT-III assembly and cytokinetic abscission. Altogether, this work reveals an unexpected connection between caveolae and the ESCRT machinery and the first role of caveolae in cell division.</p><sec><title>TEASER</title><p>Caveolae limit the tension in the intercellular bridge during cytokinesis to enable ESCRT-III assembly and successful abscission.</p></sec>",2022-01-04

The cerebellum is considered a learning machine essential for time interval estimation underlying motor coordination and other behaviors. Theoretical work has proposed that the cerebellar input recipient structure, the granule cell layer (GCL), performs pattern separation of inputs that facilitates learning in Purkinje cells (P-cells). However, the relationship between input reformatting and learning outcomes has remained debated, with roles emphasized for pattern separation features from sparsification to decorrelation. We took a novel approach by training a minimalist model of the cerebellar cortex to learn complex time-series data from naturalistic inputs, in contrast to traditional classification tasks. The model robustly produced temporal basis sets from naturalistic inputs, and the resultant GCL output supported learning of temporally complex target functions. Learning favored surprisingly dense granule cell activity, yet the key statistical features in GCL population activity that drove learning differed from those seen previously for classification tasks. Moreover, different cerebellar tasks were supported by diverse pattern separation features that matched the demands of the tasks. These findings advance testable hypotheses for mechanisms of temporal basis set formation and predict that population statistics of granule cell activity may differ across cerebellar regions to support distinct behaviors.</p>",2022-01-06

Here, we identify a transcription factor associated with the widespread CBASS bacterial immune system, that we term CapW. CapW forms a homodimer and binds a palindromic DNA sequence in the CBASS promoter region. Two crystal structures of CapW reveal how the protein switches from a DNA binding-competent state to a ligand-bound state that cannot bind DNA due to misalignment of dimer-related DNA binding domains. We show that CapW strongly represses CBASS gene expression in uninfected cells, and that CapW disruption likely results in toxicity due to uncontrolled CBASS expression.

Post-zygotic development of the Paramecium somatic genome requires elimination of thousands of transposon remnants (IESs) and transposable elements that are scattered throughout the germline genome (Garnier et al. 2004). The elimination process is guided by Piwi-associated small RNAs and leads to precise cleavage at IES boundaries (Bouhouche et al. 2011; Furrer et al. 2017). Previous research suggests that small RNAs induce heterochromatin formation within IESs, which, in turn, is required for DNA elimination (Liu et al. 2007). Here we show that IES recognition and precise excision is facilitated by recruitment of a homolog of a chromatin remodeler ISWI, which depletes target genomic regions of nucleosomes, making the chromatin accessible for DNA cleavage. ISWI knockdown in Paramecium leads to pronounced inhibition of DNA elimination. Furthermore, nucleosome profiling indicates that ISWI is required for IES elimination in nucleosome-dense genomic regions, while other IESs do not require small RNAs or ISWI for excision. ISWI silencing notably also reduces DNA elimination precision, resulting in aberrant excision at alternative IES boundaries. In summary, we demonstrate that chromatin remodeling that increases DNA accessibility together with small RNAs are necessary for efficient and precise DNA elimination in Paramecium.</p>",2022-01-05

In addition, social groups within each population also differed in diet and, to a lesser extent, in gut microbial composition and diversity. Individuals at low elevation consumed a larger variety of plant taxa than those at high elevation, consistent with the notion that dietary choice is constrained by food availability that changes with elevation. Despite no detectable correlation between the diet and gut microbiome in richness or evenness, dietary and gut microbial composition covaried significantly. As we did not find evidence for an effect of genetic relatedness on the composition of the gut microbiome of Grauer’s gorillas, this pattern is likely a result of long-term social, ecological, and geographic factors acting on both diet and microbiome.

Pathogenic trypanosomes often have broad host niches that preclude identification of host specific adaptations. In contrast, some non-pathogenic species of the genus Trypanosoma have highly specific hosts and vectors. Trypanosoma theileri, a non-pathogenic parasite of bovines, has a predicted surface protein architecture that likely aids survival in its mammalian host, distinct from the dominant variant surface glycoprotein coat of pathogenic African trypanosomes. In both species, their surface proteins are encoded by genes which account for ~10% of their genome. A non-pathogenic parasite of sheep, Trypanosoma melophagium, is transmitted by the sheep ked and is closely related to T. theileri. To explore host and vector specificity between these closely related species, we sequenced the T. melophagium genome and transcriptome and an annotated draft genome was assembled. T. melophagium was compared to 43 kinetoplastid genomes, including T. theileri. T. melophagium and T. theileri have an AT biased genome, the greatest bias of publicly available trypanosomatids. This trend may result from selection acting to decrease the genome nucleotide cost. The T. melophagium genome is 6.3Mb smaller than T. theileri and large families of proteins, characteristic of the predicted surface of T. theileri, were found to be absent or greatly reduced in T. melophagium. Instead, T. melophagium has modestly expanded protein families associated with the avoidance of complement-mediated lysis. The genome of T. melophagium contains core genes required for development, glycolysis, RNA interference, and meiotic exchange, each being shared with T. theileri. Comparisons between T. melophagium and T. theileri provide insight into the specific adaptations of these related trypanosomatids to their distinct mammalian hosts and arthropod vectors.</p>",2022-01-05

The interaction between POLV, AGO4, DMS3, DRD1, RDM1 and DRM2 promotes DRM2-mediated de novo DNA methylation.

In silico exploration of Arabidopsis RBR protein partners revealed that several members of the RdDM pathway contain a motif that confers high affinity binding to  RBR, including the largest subunits of POLIV and POLV (NRPD1 and NRPE1), the shared second largest subunit of POLIV and POLV (NRPD/E2), RDR1, RDR2, DCL3, DRM2 and SUVR2.

Here, we developed a systematic and comprehensive approach using dotplot matrices and dimensionality reduction to define LCR relationships proteome-wide and to create a map of LCR sequences capable of integrating any LCR features. As a proof of concept of the importance of LCR relationships, we demonstrate the biological significance of LCR copy number for higher order assembly of the nucleolar protein RPA43 both in vitro and in vivo.

Results: We evaluated the function, selective pressures, and sequence variation across core and derived components of human complex enhancers. We find that both components are older than expected from the genomic background, and cores are enriched for derived sequences of similar evolutionary ages. Both components show strong evidence of biochemical activity in massively parallel report assays (MPRAs). However, core and derived sequences have distinct transcription factor (TF) binding preferences that are largely stable across evolutionary origins. Given these signatures of function, both core and derived sequences have substantial evidence of purifying selection. Nonetheless, derived sequences exhibit weaker purifying selection than adjacent cores. Derived sequences also tolerate more common genetic variation and are enriched compared to cores for eQTL associated with gene expression variability in human populations. Conclusions: Both core and derived sequences have strong evidence of gene regulatory function, but derived sequences have distinct constraint profiles, TF binding preferences, and tolerance to variation compared with cores. We propose that the step-wise integration of younger derived and older core sequences has generated regulatory substrates with robust activity and the potential for functional variation.

The effects obtained from MR studies are often interpreted as the lifetime effect of the exposure in question. However, the causal effects of many exposures are thought to vary throughout an individual’s lifetime and there may be periods during which an exposure has more of an effect on a particular outcome. Multivariable MR (MVMR) is an extension of MR that allows for multiple, potentially highly related, exposures to be included in an MR estimation. MVMR estimates the direct effect of each exposure on the outcome conditional on all of the other exposures included in the estimation. We explore the use of MVMR to estimate the direct effect of a single exposure at different time points in an individual’s lifetime on an outcome. We use simulations to illustrate the interpretation of the results from such analyses and the key assumptions required. We show that causal effects at different time periods can be estimated through MVMR when the association between the genetic variants used as instruments and the exposure measured at those time periods varies, however this estimation will not necessarily identify exact time periods over which an exposure has the most effect on the outcome.

Profilin is essential for many neuronal cell processes through its regulation of lipids, nuclear signals, and cytoskeletal dynamics, including actin filament assembly. Direct interactions between profilin and actin monomers inhibit actin filament polymerization. In contrast, profilin can also stimulate polymerization by simultaneously binding actin monomers and proline-rich tracts found in other proteins. Whether the ALS-associated mutations in profilin compromise these actin assembly functions is unclear. We performed a quantitative biochemical comparison of the direct and formin-mediated impact for the eight ALS-associated profilin variants on actin assembly using classic protein-binding and single-filament microscopy assays. We determined that the binding constants of each profilin for actin monomers generally correlates with the actin nucleation strength associated with each ALS-related profilin. In the presence of formin, the A20T, R136W, Q139L, and C71G variants failed to activate the elongation phase of actin assembly. This diverse range of formin-activities is not fully explained through profilin-PLP interactions, as all ALS-associated variants bind a formin-derived PLP peptide with similar affinities. However, chemical denaturation experiments suggest that the folding stability of these profilins impact some of these effects on actin assembly. Thus, changes in profilin protein stability and alterations in actin filament polymerization may both contribute to the profilin-mediated actin disruptions in ALS.</p>",2022-01-05

The Australian B. pertussis population was found to be composed of mostly ptxP3 strains carrying different fim3 alleles, with ptxP3-fim3A genotype expanded far more than ptxP3-fim3B. Within the former, there were six co-circulating epidemic lineages (EL1 to EL6). The multiple ELs emerged, expanded, and then declined at different time points over the two epidemics, likely driven by immune selection from pertussis vaccination and natural infection in addition to local and global transmission events. Both hard and soft selective sweeps through vaccine selection pressures determined the current B. pertussis population dynamics. Relative risk analysis found that once a new B. pertussis lineage emerged, it was more likely to spread locally within the first 1.5 years. However, after 1.5 years, any new lineage was likely to expand to a wider region and became no longer spatially structured across the country. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the expansion of ptxP3 strains was also associated with replacement of the type III secretion system allele bscI1 with bscI3.

To explore this hypothesis, we used real-time imaging of transcriptional events at the onset of each interphase. Endogenously tagged RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) abruptly formed clusters before nascent transcripts accumulated, indicating recruitment prior to transcriptional engagement. Injection of inhibitors of DNA replication prevented RNAPII clustering, blocked formation of foci of the pioneer factor Zelda, and largely prevented expression of transcription reporters. Knockdown of Zelda or the histone acetyltransferase CBP prevented RNAPII cluster formation except at the replication-dependent (RD) histone gene locus. We suggest a model in which the passage of replication forks allows Zelda and a distinct pathway at the RD histone locus to reconfigure chromatin to nucleate RNAPII clustering and promote transcriptional initiation. The replication dependency of these events defers initiation of transcription and ensures that RNA polymerases transcribe behind advancing replication forks.

Here we present an integrative analysis of the timing and intensity of the genome-wide alterations in cucumber plants infected with Hop stunt viroid (HSVd). Differential host transcriptome, sRNAnome and methylome were integrated to determine the temporal response to viroid-infection. Our results support that HSVd promotes a dynamic redesign of the cucumber regulatory pathways predominantly affecting specific regulatory layers at different infection phases.

In this study, we investigated patterns of recombination, transposable element abundance and coding sequence evolution across the genomes of 1,445 individuals from three sunflower species, as well as within nine inversions segregating within species. We also analyzed the effects of inversion genotypes on 87 phenotypic traits to test for overdominance. We found significant negative correlations of long terminal repeat retrotransposon abundance and deleterious mutations with recombination rates across the genome in all three species. However, we failed to detect an increase in these features in the inversions, except for a modest increase in the proportion of stop codon mutations in several very large or rare inversions. Moreover, there was little evidence of phenotypic overdominance in inversion heterozygotes, consistent with observations of minimal deleterious load. On the other hand, significantly greater load was observed for inversions in populations polymorphic for a given inversion compared to populations monomorphic for one of the arrangements, suggesting that the local state of inversion polymorphism affects deleterious load. These seemingly contradictory results can be explained by the geographic structuring and consequent excess homozygosity of inversions in wild sunflowers. Inversions contributing to local adaptation often exhibit geographic structure; such inversions represent ideal recombination modifiers, acting to facilitate adaptive divergence with gene flow, while largely averting the accumulation of deleterious mutations due to recombination suppression.</p>",2022-01-06

However, a quantitative analysis of the per nucleotide mutation rate measured by mutational profiling, from which SHAPE reactivities are derived, reveals a global five-fold rate increase in the presence of molar excess of NSP2. We demonstrate that the standard normalization procedure used in deriving SHAPE reactivities from mutation rates can mask an important global effect of an RNA chaperone activity. Further analysis of the mutation rate in the context of structural classification reveals a larger effect on stems rather than loop elements. Together, these data provide the first experimentally derived secondary structure model of the RV transcriptome and reveal that NSP2 acts by globally increasing RNA backbone flexibility in a concentration-dependent manner, consistent with its promiscuous RNA-binding nature.</p>",2022-01-04

It has been demonstrated that lineage specification is governed by both chemical and mechanical cues. Among all the different mechanical cues known to control hMSCs fate, substrate stiffness is the most well-studied. It has been shown that the naive mesenchymal stem cells when cultured on soft gel, they commit towards adipogenic lineage while when cultured on stiff gel they become osteogenic. Soft substrates also cause less cell spreading, less traction, less focal adhesion assembly and stress fibre formation. Furthermore, chromatin condensation increases when cells are cultured on soft substrates. As the nucleus has been postulated to be mechanosensor and mechanotransducer, in this paper we asked the question how mechanosensing and mechanoresponse process will be influenced if we change the chromatin condensation by using an external chemical stimulus. To address this question, we treated hMSCs cultured on soft polyacrylamide (PA) gels with a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) called Valproic Acid (VA) which decondense the chromatin by hyperacetylation of histone proteins. We found that the treatment with VA overrides the effect of soft substrates on hMSCs morphology, cellular traction, nuclear localization of mechnosensory protein YAP, and differentiation. VA treated cells behaved as if they are on stiff substrates in all aspects tested here. Furthermore, we have shown that VA controls hMSCs differentiation via activation of ERK/MAPK pathway by increasing the p-ERK expression which inhibits adipogenic differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells.

We study the process of phagocytosis by considering a simplified coarse grained model of a three-dimensional vesicle, having uniform adhesion interaction with a rigid particle, in the presence of curved membrane proteins and active cytoskeletal forces. Complete engulfment is achieved when the bending energy cost of the vesicle is balanced by the gain in the adhesion energy. The presence of curved (convex) proteins reduces the bending energy cost by self-organizing with higher density at the highly curved leading edge of the engulfing membrane, which forms the circular rim of the phagocytic cup that wraps around the particle. This allows the engulfment to occur at much smaller adhesion strength. When the curved proteins exert outwards protrusive forces, representing actin polymerization, at the leading edge, we find that engulfment is achieved more quickly and at lower protein density. We consider spherical as well as non-spherical particles, and find that non-spherical particles are more difficult to engulf in comparison to the spherical particles of the same surface area. For non-spherical particles, the engulfment time crucially depends upon the initial orientation of the particles with respect to the vesicle.

Here we show that eATP that accumulates in wounded leaves and is sensed by the purinoreceptor kinase P2K is required for the activation of the ROS wave during wounding. Application of eATP to unwounded leaves triggered the ROS wave, and the activation of the ROS wave by wounding or eATP application was suppressed in mutants deficient in P2K (i.e., p2k1-3, p2k2, and p2k1-3p2k2). In addition, the expression of several systemic wound response transcripts was suppressed in mutants deficient in P2K during wounding. Our findings reveal that in addition to sensing glutamate via GLRs, eATP sensed by P2Ks is playing a key role in the triggering of systemic wound responses in plants.</p>",2022-01-06

Modularity has been linked with a wide range of cognitive abilities such as intelligence, memory, and learning. However, much of this work has (1) considered modularity while a participant is at rest rather than during tasks conditions and/or (2) relied primarily on lab-based cognitive assessments. Thus, the extent to which modularity can provide information about real-word behavior remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether functional modularity during resting-state and task-based fMRI was associated with academic learning (measured by GPA) and ability (measured by PSAT) in a large sample of high school students. Additional questions concerned the extent to which modularity differs between rest and task conditions, and across spatial scales. Results indicated that whole-brain modularity during task conditions was significantly associated with academic learning. In contrast to prior work, no such associations were observed for resting-state modularity. We further showed that differences in modularity between task conditions and resting-state varied across spatial scales. Taken together, the present findings inform how functional brain network modularity - during task conditions and while at rest - relate to a range of cognitive abilities.</p>",2022-01-06

While the vg toolkit (Garrison et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2018) is a popular aligner of short reads, GraphAligner (Rautiainen and Marschall, Genome Biology, 2020) is the state-of-the-art aligner of long reads. GraphAligner works by finding candidate read occurrences based on individually extending the best seeds of the read in the variation graph. However, a more principled approach recognized in the community is to co-linearly chain multiple seeds. We present a new algorithm to co-linearly chain a set of seeds in an acyclic variation graph, together with the first efficient implementation of such a co-linear chaining algorithm into a new aligner of long reads to variation graphs, GraphChainer. Compared to GraphAligner, at a normalized edit distance threshold of 40%, it aligns 9% to 12% more reads, and 15% to 19% more total read length, on real PacBio reads from human chromosomes 1 and 22. On both simulated and real data, GraphChainer aligns between 97% and 99% of all reads, and of total read length. At the more stringent normalized edit distance threshold of 30%, GraphChainer aligns up to 29% more total real read length than GraphAligner.

In the present work, we virtually screened 688 naphthoquinoidal compounds and derivatives against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2.

Schaefer'}, {'name': 'Isabelle Trier'}, {'name': 'Alice L. Zhang'}, {'name': 'Lilian Kabeche'}, {'name': 'Candice E. Paulsen'}]","<p>The wasabi receptor, TRPA1, is a non-selective homotetrameric cation channel expressed in primary sensory neurons of the pain pathway, where it is activated by diverse chemical irritants. A direct role for TRPA1 in human health has been highlighted by the discovery of genetic variants associated with severe pain disorders. One such TRPA1 mutant was identified in a father-son pair with cramp fasciculation syndrome (CFS) and neuronal hyperexcitability-hypersensitivity symptoms that may be caused by aberrant channel activity, though the mechanism of action for this mutant is unknown. Here, we show the CFS-associated R919* TRPA1 mutant is functionally inactive when expressed alone in heterologous cells, which is not surprising since it lacks the 201 C-terminal amino acids that house critical channel gating machinery including the pore-lining transmembrane helix. Interestingly, the R919* mutant confers enhanced agonist sensitivity when co-expressed with wild type (WT) TRPA1. This channel hyperactivation mechanism is conserved in distant TRPA1 species orthologues and can be recapitulated in the capsaicin receptor, TRPV1. Using a combination of ratiometric calcium imaging, immunostaining, surface biotinylation, pulldown assays, fluorescence size exclusion chromatography, and proximity biotinylation assays, we show that the R919* mutant co-assembles with WT subunits into heteromeric channels. Within these heteromers, we postulate that R919* TRPA1 subunits contribute to hyperactivation by lowering energetic barriers to channel activation contributed by the missing regions. Additionally, we show heteromer activation can originate from the R919* TRPA1 subunits, which suggests an unexpected role for the ankyrin repeat and coiled coil domains in concerted channel gating. Our results demonstrate the R919* TRPA1 mutant confers gain-of-function thereby expanding the physiological impact of nonsense mutations, reveals a novel and genetically tractable mechanism for selective channel sensitization that may be broadly applicable to other receptors, and uncovers new gating insights that may explain the molecular mechanism of temperature sensing by some TRPA1 orthologues.</p>",2022-01-05

Recent single-cell sequencing (scRNAseq) studies have revealed the context-dependent diversity in microglial properties and gene expression, but the cues promoting this diversity are not well defined. Here, we ask how interactions with apoptotic neurons shape microglial state, including lysosomal and lipid metabolism gene expression and independence from Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) for survival. Using early postnatal mouse retina, a CNS region undergoing significant developmental remodeling, we performed scRNAseq on microglia from mice that are wild-type, lack neuronal apoptosis (Bax KO), or are treated with CSF1R inhibitor (PLX3397). We find that interactions with apoptotic neurons drives multiple microglial remodeling states, subsets of which are resistant to CSF1R inhibition. We find that TAM receptor Mer and complement receptor 3 are required for clearance of apoptotic neurons, but that Mer does not drive expression of remodeling genes. We show TAM receptor Axl is negligible for phagocytosis or remodeling gene expression but is consequential for microglial survival in the absence of CSF1R signaling. Thus, interactions with apoptotic neurons shift microglia towards distinct remodeling states and through Axl, alters microglial dependence on survival pathway, CSF1R.</p>",2022-01-06

But do highly accurate codes require fine tuning of the response properties? We address this question with the use of a benchmark model: a neural network with random synaptic weights which result in output cells with irregular tuning curves. Irregularity enhances the local resolution of the code but gives rise to catastrophic, global errors. For optimal smoothness of the tuning curves, when local and global errors balance out, the neural network compresses information from a high-dimensional representation to a low-dimensional one, and the resulting distributed code achieves exponential accuracy. An analysis of recordings from monkey motor cortex points to such 'compressed efficient coding'.

However, HY5 has not been characterized from plants known to synthesize important secondary metabolites. In this study, based on homology search and phylogenetic analysis, HY5 has been identified from Nicotiana tobaccum, and characterized for its role in secondary plant product biosynthesis and stress response through developing overexpressing lines and CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout mutant plants. NtHY5 was able to complement the Arabidopsis thaliana hy5 mutant at molecular, morphological and biochemical levels. Overexpression of NtHY5 in tobacco led to the up-regulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway genes and enhanced the flavonoid content, whereas mutant plants had the opposite effect. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) suggested that NtHY5 interacts with the promoter of NtMYB12, a transcription factor known to regulate flavonoid biosynthesis. In addition, NtHY5 enhanced the abiotic stress tolerance as evident by the salt tolerance ability of HY5 overexpressing lines by diminishing the ROS accumulation after salt treatment. These data provide credible evidence about the potential role of NtHY5 in light-mediated flavonoid biosynthesis, plant growth and abiotic stress tolerance in tobacco.

A simple in vitro model system using cell lines highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection are critical to facilitate the study of the virus cycle and to discover effective antivirals against the virus. Human lung alveolar A549 cells are regarded as a useful and valuable model for respiratory virus infection. However, SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 as receptor for viral entry and the TMPRSS2 to prime the Spike protein, both of which are negligibly expressed in A549 cells. Here, we report the generation of a robust human lung epithelial cell-based model by transducing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 into A549 cells and show that the ACE2 enriched A549<sup>ACE2/TMPRSS2</sup> cells (ACE2plus) and its single-cell-derived subclone (ACE2plusC3) are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These engineered ACE2plus showed higher <italic>ACE2</italic> and <italic>TMPRSS2</italic> mRNA expression levels than currently used Calu3 and commercial A549<sup>ACE2/TMPRSS2</sup> cells. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins were also highly and ubiquitously expressed in ACE2plusC3 cells. Additionally, antiviral drugs like Camostat mesylate, EIDD-1931, and Remdesivir strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication. Notably, multinucleated syncytia, a clinical feature commonly observed in severe COVID-19 patients was induced in ACE2plusC3 cells either by virus infection or by overexpressing the Spike proteins of different variants of SARS-CoV-2. Syncytial process was effectively blocked by the furin protease inhibitor, Decanoyl-RVKR-CMK. Taken together, we have developed a robust human A549 lung epithelial cell-based model that can be applied to probe SARS-CoV-2 replication and to facilitate the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.</p>",2022-01-03

This pattern has yet to be examined in other NHP, like bonobos (Pan paniscus). We compared FGMC to 16S rRNA amplicons for 201 bonobo fecal samples collected in the wild across five months to evaluate the impact of stress, measured with FGMC, on the gut microbiota. Simpsons index was the only alpha diversity index to have a significant linear relationship with FGMC [R2 = 0.9643, F(4, 210) = 28.56, p = 0.0023]. FGMC level explained 1.63% of the variation in beta diversity for Jensen-Shannon Distance, 2.49% for Weighted UniFrac, and 3.53% for Unweighted UniFrac using PERMANOVAs. Differential abundance models showed seventeen taxa that were significantly correlated with FGMC. We found that genus SHD-231 in the family Anaerolinaceae was significant in our differential abundance model results, similar to western lowland gorilla abundance model results. These results suggest bonobos exhibit different patterns than gorillas in alpha and beta diversity measures and that members of the family Anaerolinaceae may be differentially affected by host stress across great apes.

Given the association of Wnt5A signaling with immune homeostasis, we evaluated the utility of Wnt5A in antigen processing, cross-presentation, and CD8 T cell activation. Using mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells as antigen-presenting cells and ovalbumin as a model antigen we found that Wnt5A mediated regulation of actin and proteasome dynamics is inherently associated with antigen processing. A Wnt5A-Actin-Protasome axis also contributes to antigen cross-presentation and antigen responsive CD8 T cell expansion. In concurrence with these observations, we demonstrated impaired activation of ovalbumin-specific CD8 T cells in ovalbumin immunized Wnt5A heterozygous mice as illustrated by their poor CD8 T cell recall response to ovalbumin when compared to similarly immunized wild type cohorts.

In this study, we investigate four properties: introns, upstream regulatory motifs, 5’ UTRs and protein domains, in 23135 human proto-genes. We found that proto-genes contain introns, whose number and position correlates with the genomic position of proto-gene emergence. The origin of these introns is debated, as our result suggest that 41% proto-genes might have captured existing introns, as well as the fact that 13.7% of them do not splice the ORF. We show that proto-genes which emerged via overprinting tend to be more enriched in core promotor motifs, while intergenic and intronic ones are more enriched in enhancers, even if the motif TATA is most expressed upstream these genes. Intergenic and intronic 5’ UTRs of protogenes have a lower potential to stabilise mRNA structures than exonic proto-genes and established human genes. Finally, we confirm that proto-genes gain new putative domains with age. Overall, we find that regulatory motifs inducing transcription and translation of previously non-coding sequences may facilitate proto-gene emergence. Our paper demonstrates that introns, 5’UTRs, and domains have specific properties in proto-genes.

Unlike nNOS (-) cells, nNOS (+) neurons fail to generate reactive oxygen species in response to NMDAR activation, a key divergent step in the excitotoxic cascade. However, additional mechanisms underlying the reduced vulnerability of nNOS (+) neurons to NMDAR-driven neuronal death have not been explored. Using functional, genetic, and molecular analysis in striatal cultures, we demonstrate that nNOS (+) neurons possess distinct NMDAR properties. These specific features are primarily driven by the peculiar redox milieu of this subpopulation. In addition, we found that nNOS (+) neurons exposed to a pharmacological maneuver set to mimic chronic excitotoxicity alter their responses to NMDAR-mediated challenges.

Here we took an advantage of single cell neuronal Ca2+ imaging and intrahippocampal kainic acid (KA)-induced chronic epilepsy in mice to investigate progressive changes in key cardiorespiratory brainstem circuits during chronic epilepsy. Following induction of status epilepticus (SE), we observed that the adaptive ventilatory responses to hypercapnia were reduced in mice with chronic epilepsy for 5 weeks post-SE. These changes were paralleled by reduced chemosensitivity of neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), an important centre for respiratory chemosensitivity. Over the same period, chemosensory responses of the presympathetic RVLM neurons showed a slower decrease. Mice with chronic epilepsy were more sensitive to chemoconvulsants and exhibited a greatly reduced latency to seizure induction compared to naive mice. This enhanced sensitivity to seizures, which invade the RTN, puts the chemosensory circuits at further risk and increases the chances of terminal apnoea.

A key question is how this diversity of reproductive modes arose and whether reproductive diversification underlies species diversification? To test these questions, we evaluate the most basal jawed vertebrates, Chondrichthyans, which have one of the greatest ranges of reproductive and ecological diversity among vertebrates. We reconstructed the sequence of reproductive mode evolution across a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of 610 chondrichthyans. We find that egg-laying is ancestral, and that live-bearing evolved at least seven times. Matrotrophy (i.e. additional maternal contributions) evolved at least 15 times, with evidence of one reversal. In sharks, transitions to live-bearing and matrotrophy are more prevalent in larger-bodied species in the tropics. Further, the evolution of live-bearing is associated with a near-doubling of the diversification rate, but, there is only a small increase in diversification associated with the appearance of matrotrophy. The chondrichthyan diversification and radiation, particularly throughout the shallow tropical shelf seas and oceanic pelagic habitats, appears to be associated with the evolution of live-bearing and the proliferation of a wide range of maternal investment in their developing offspring.</p>",2022-01-06

Here, we report that LIX1 is S-palmitoylated on cysteine 84 and localized in mitochondria. LIX1 knock-down affects the mitochondrial ultrastructure, resulting in decreased respiration and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. This is sufficient to downregulate YAP1/TAZ and reprogram KIT- positive GIST cells towards the smooth muscle cell lineage with reduced proliferative and invasive capacities.

The apical cap cytoskeleton was recently demonstrated to govern the stability of the apical complex, which controls parasite motility, invasion, and egress. While this role was determined by individually assessing the apical cap proteins AC9, AC10, and the MAP kinase ERK7, how the three proteins collaborate to stabilize the apical complex is unknown. In this study, we use a combination of deletion analyses and yeast-2-hybrid experiments to establish that these proteins form an essential complex in the apical cap.

As part of an extended, multi-stage courtship ritual, male plethodontid salamanders deliver rapidly evolving protein pheromones that modify female behavior and improve male reproductive success. Despite great interest in this set of pre-mating reproductive barriers, limited characterization of plethodontid gametes has prohibited investigation of post-mating pre-zygotic barriers such as sperm-egg recognition.

Vhs causes a number of changes to the infected cell environment that favour translation of late (L) virus proteins: cellular mRNAs are degraded, immediate-early (IE) and early (E) viral transcripts are sequestered in the nucleus with polyA binding protein (PABPC1), and dsRNA is degraded to help dampen the PKR-dependent stress response. To further our understanding of the cell biology of vhs, we constructed a virus expressing vhs tagged at its C-terminus with GFP. When first expressed, vhs-GFP localised to juxtanuclear clusters, and later it colocalised and interacted with its binding partner VP16, and was packaged into virions. Despite vhs-GFP maintaining activity when expressed in isolation, it failed to degrade mRNA or relocalise PABPC1 during infection, while viral transcript levels were similar to those seen for a vhs knockout virus. PKR phosphorylation was also enhanced in vhs-GFP infected cells, in line with a failure to degrade dsRNA. Nonetheless, mRNA FISH revealed that as in Wt but not Δvhs infection, IE and E, but not L transcripts were retained in the nucleus of vhs-GFP infected cells at late times. Moreover, a representative cellular transcript which is ordinarily highly susceptible to vhs degradation, was also retained in the nucleus.

Here we describe a virus expressing vhs tagged at its C-terminus with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and show that the vhs-GFP fusion protein retains the physical properties of native vhs, but does not induce the degradation of mRNA. Nonetheless, vhs-GFP maintains the ability to trap the infected cell transcriptome in the nucleus, proving for the first time that mRNA degradation is not a prerequisite for vhs effects on the nuclear transcriptome. This virus has therefore uncoupled the nuclear retention and degradation activities of vhs, providing new understanding of vhs during infection.</p></sec>",2022-01-05

The Ñeembucú Wetlands Complex is the largest wetland in Paraguay, lying within the Paraguay-Paraná-La Plata River system. This study aims to use remotely sensed data to map land cover between 2006 and 2021, quantify wetland change over the 15-year study period and thus identify land cover types vulnerable to change in the Ñeembucú Wetlands Complex. Forest, dryland vegetation, vegetated wetland and open water were identified using Random Forest supervised classifications trained on visual inspection data and field data. Annual change of −0.34, 4.95, −1.65, 0.40 was observed for forest, dryland, vegetated wetland and open water, respectively. Wetland and forest conversion is attributed to agricultural and urban expansion. With ongoing pressures on wetlands, monitoring will be a key tool for addressing change and advising decision-making around development and conservation of valuable ecosystem goods and services in the Ñeembucú Wetlands Complex.</p>",2022-01-03

Mucorales fungi are notorious for presenting resistance to most antifungal drugs. The absence of effective means to treat these infections results in mortality rates approaching 100% in cases of disseminated infection.

Here, I used a simulation-based approach to investigate what epidemiological processes influence the results of clustering and TBL analyses, and whether difference in transmission can be detected with these methods. I simulated MTB epidemics with different dynamics (latency, infectious period, transmission rate, basic reproductive number R<sub>0</sub>, sampling proportion, and molecular clock), and found that all these factors, except the length of the infectious period and R<sub>0</sub>, affect the results of clustering and TBL distributions. I show that standard interpretations of this type of analyses ignore two main caveats: 1) clustering results and TBL depend on many factors that have nothing to do with transmission, 2) clustering results and TBL do not tell anything about whether the epidemic is stable, growing, or shrinking. An important consequence is that the optimal SNP threshold for clustering depends on the epidemiological conditions, and that sub-populations with different epidemiological characteristics should not be analyzed with the same threshold. Finally, these results suggest that different clustering rates and TBL distributions, that are found consistently between different MTB lineages, are probably due to intrinsic bacterial factors, and do not indicate necessarily differences in transmission or evolutionary success.</p>",2022-01-03

Although individual protein products translated in mitochondria have been monitored, the lack of techniques that address the variation in overall mitochondrial protein synthesis in cell populations poses analytic challenges.

It is also unknown whether conventional cancer drug development methods, including cancer cell line derived xenograft (CDX) and patient cancer cell derived xenograft (PDX), generate cytocapsular tubes (CCTs). It is also unclear whether xenografts can be created that contain CCTs for efficient cancer drug development. Here, we investigated CCT functions related to cancer drug resistance, CCTs in CDX and PDX and CCT xenograft (CCTX). Using clinical cancer tissues, we discovered that CCTs potently shielded against multiple chemotherapy treatments with diverse conventional cancer drugs. Next, our quantitative analyses show that CCT biomembrane drug barriers significantly increase cancer drug resistance by 6.6-folds to14-folds. We found that conventional CDX and PDX animal models do not generate CCTs in these xenografts. By mimicking in vivo cancer cell environments for cancer patient cancer cell culturing, we have successfully isolated CH-5high/CH-6high subpopulations of patient breast cancer cells and pancreas cancer cells that are propertied with cytocapsular tube generation capacities and engender large quantities of CCTs in mouse xenografts. Biochemical and immunohistochemistry analyses demonstrated that CCTs in these xenografts are similar to those in clinical cancer tissues. In summary, our research has identified that CCTs and networks function as physical superdefence freeway systems conducting conventional cancer drug pan-resistant tumor metastasis, and developed a CCTX platform for highly efficient cancer drug development, which pave avenues for more efficient development of effective and precise cancer drugs for tumor cure at both personal and broad-spectrum levels.</p>",2022-01-06

Consistent with these findings, inhibition of integrins or FAK/PYK2 signaling diminishes leukemia burden in multiple organs and confers a survival advantage in a mouse model of T-ALL.

The most prominent arguments focus on either evolvability, genetic diversity, or mutational robustness to justify why the benefit of recombination overcomes its costs, with partially contradicting results.

In this study, we focus on finite populations evolving on neutral networks, which already display remarkably complex behavior. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of recombination by jointly considering different measures of evolvability, genetic diversity, and mutational robustness over a broad parameter range, such that many evolutionary regimes are covered. We find that several of these measures vary non-monotonically with the rates of mutation and recombination. Moreover, the presence of lethal genotypes that introduce inhomogeneities in the network of viable states qualitatively alters the effects of recombination. We conclude that conflicting trends induced by recombination can be explained by an emerging trade-off between evolvability and genetic diversity on the one hand, and mutational robustness and fitness on the other.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether ejaculated sperm, which are suspended in the secretions of the AGs, elicit a different  endometrial transcriptomic response than epididymal sperm, which have never been exposed to AG factors. To this end, bovine endometrial explants collected from heifers in oestrus were incubated alone (control), or with epididymal or ejaculated sperm.

Here, the concentration of soluble gas in xylem sap was estimated in vivo using well-watered Citrus plants under varying levels of air temperature and photoperiodic exposure, and compared to modelled data. The gas concentration in xylem sap showed non-equilibrium curves, with a minimum over-or undersaturation of 5% compared to gas solubility based on Henry's law. A similar diurnal pattern was obtained from the gas concentration in the cut-open conduits and discharge tube, and oversolubility was strongly associated with decreasing xylem water potentials during transpiration. Although our model did not explain the daily changes in gas solubility for an anisobaric situation, oversolubility characterises nanoconfined liquids, such as sap inside cell walls.

Variable patterns of activation have previously been attributed to insufficient statistical power. We therefore sought to clarify the neural correlates of error awareness in a large event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. Four hundred and two healthy participants undertook the Error Awareness Task, a motor Go/No-Go response inhibition paradigm in which participants were required to indicate their awareness of commission errors. Compared to unaware errors, aware errors were accompanied by significantly greater activity in a network of regions including the insula cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and midline structures such as the anterior cingulate cortex and supplementary motor area. Error awareness activity was related to indices of task performance and dimensional measures of psychopathology in select regions including the insula, supramarginal gyrus and supplementary motor area.

We test this hypothesis using a phenomenological network model to simulate interactions between neural mass potentials (resonating at 40Hz) in the structural connectome. Crucially, we identify a critical regime where metastable oscillatory modes emerge spontaneously in the delta (0.5-4Hz), theta (4-8Hz), alpha (8-13Hz) and beta (13-30Hz) frequency bands from weak synchronization of subsystems, closely approximating the MEG power spectra from 89 healthy individuals.

Here, we provide evidence from studies of an authentic mouse model of the lysosomal storage disease Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) that has reduced lysosomal Ca2+ levels, and genetically modified mice in which the two-pore lysosomal Ca2+ release channel family are deleted that lysosomal Ca2+ signaling is required for normal pro-inflammatory responses. We demonstrate that production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta via the NLRP3 inflammasome is significantly reduced in murine Niemann-Pick Type C, the inhibition is selective because secretion of TNF alpha is not diminished, and it is a consequence of inefficient inflammasome priming.  Synthesis of precursor ProIL-1 beta is significantly reduced in macrophages genetically deficient in the lysosomal protein Npc1, which is mutated in most clinical cases of NPC, and in wild type cells in which Npc1 activity is pharmacologically inhibited. Comparable reductions in ProIL-1 beta generation were measured in vitro and in vivo by macrophages genetically altered to lack expression of the two-pore lysosomal Ca2+ release channels Tpcn1 or Tpcn2.

In this paper, we propose a computational method to estimate the rate of switching between expression states, given data from a Luria-Delbrück style fluctuation test that is experimentally simple and feasible.

We have previously isolated M<sub>s</sub> from tauopathy brains, but it is unknown if disease begins with M<sub>s</sub> formation followed by fibril assembly, or if M<sub>s</sub> derives from fibrils and is an epiphenomenon. Consequently, we studied a tauopathy mouse model (PS19) that expresses full-length human (1N4R) tau containing a disease-associated mutation (P301S). Using tau repeat domain biosensor cells, we detected insoluble tau seeding activity at 2 months. We found insoluble tau protein assemblies by immunoblot at 3 months. We next immunopurified monomer from mice aged 1-6 weeks using size exclusion chromatography. We detected soluble seeding activity at 4 weeks, before insoluble material or larger assemblies, with assemblies ranging from n=1-3 tau units. By 5 and 6 weeks, large soluble assemblies had formed. This indicated the first detectable pathological forms of tau were M<sub>s</sub>. We next tested for post-translational modifications of tau monomer from 1-6 weeks. We detected no phosphorylation unique to M<sub>s</sub> in PS19 or Alzheimer’s disease brain. We conclude that tauopathy begins with formation of M<sub>s</sub> monomer, whose activity is phosphorylation-independent. M<sub>s</sub> self-assembles to form oligomers before it forms insoluble fibrils. The conversion of tau monomer from M<sub>i</sub> to M<sub>s</sub> thus constitutes the first detectable step in the initiation of tauopathy in this mouse model, with obvious implications for origins of disease in humans.</p>",2022-01-03

These asymmetries are shaped by membrane binding, diffusion and transport. Theoretical studies have revealed a general requirement for non-linear positive feedback to spontaneously amplify and/or stabilize asymmetries against dispersion by diffusion and dissociation. But how specific molecular sources of non-linearity shape polarization dynamics remains poorly understood. Here we study how oligomerization of peripheral membrane proteins shapes polarization dynamics in simple feedback circuits. We show that size dependent binding avidity and mobility of membrane bound oligomers endow polarity circuits generically with several key properties. Size-dependent binding avidity confers a form of positive feedback in which the effective rate constant for subunit dissociation decreases with increasing subunit  density. This combined with additional weak linear positive feedback is sufficient for spontaneous emergence of stably polarized states. Size-dependent oligomer mobility makes symmetry-breaking and stable polarity more robust with respect to variation in subunit diffusivities and cell sizes, and slows the approach to a final stable spatial distribution, allowing cells to ""remember"" polarity boundaries imposed by transient external cues. Together, these findings reveal how oligomerization of peripheral membrane proteins can provide powerful and highly tunable sources of non-linear feedback in biochemical circuits that govern cell-surface polarity. Given its prevalence and widespread involvement in cell polarity, we speculate that self-oligomerization may have provided an accessible path to evolving simple polarity circuits.</p>",2022-01-05

Most fungi with multiple metaxin-like proteins contain two proteins, designated MTXa and MTXb. Amino acid sequence alignments show a high degree of homology among MTXa proteins, with over 60% amino acid identities, and also among MTXb proteins of fungi in the same division.

IL-27p28 subunit, also known as IL-30, was initially discovered as an IL-27-specific subunit, and its expression has thus been used as a surrogate for IL-27.

The HBV DNA in placenta was detected by qPCR using primers for X and core ORF. Expression of NTCP in placenta was analyzed by qRT-PCR and further investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) along with HBV replication biomarkers, HBeAg, and HBcAg.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>HBsAg positive subjects were divided in two groups on the basis of viral load [High Viral Load (HVL) Group; viral load ≥ 2000IU/ml, Low Viral Load (LVL) Group; viral load &lt;2000IU/ml] according to INASL guidelines 2018. HBV infected females showed increased expression of NTCP in trophoblasts of placenta compared to control group (HVL 3.69±0.13 Vs Control 1.74±0.15, p=0.0117). Furthermore, significant difference in NTCP expression was also observed between HVL and LVL group (HVL 3.69±0.13 Vs LVL 1.98±0.17, p=0.022) and positively correlated with the maternal HBV DNA load. Membranous and/or cytoplasmic immunostaining of NTCP, and cytoplasmic staining of HBeAg and HBcAg in trophoblasts along with presence of HBV DNA indicated that trophoblasts are not only susceptible to HBV infection but may also be a site for viral replication.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the pioneer study, which demonstrates expression of NTCP on placenta which may facilitate the entry of HBV. Furthermore, the study establishes the presence of HBeAg in placenta of patients without circulating HBeAg, indicating these cells may act as replication host/reservoir. This pioneering finding hints at the possibility of exploring the potential of NTCP blocking strategies in preventing vertical transmission of HBV.</p></sec>",2022-01-05
