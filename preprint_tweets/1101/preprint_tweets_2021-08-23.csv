Comparative analyses can shed light on the diversity of mutagenesis across species and on long-standing hypotheses regarding the evolution of somatic mutation rates and their role in cancer and ageing. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing of 208 intestinal crypts from 56 individuals to study the landscape of somatic mutation across 16 mammalian species. We found somatic mutagenesis to be dominated by seemingly endogenous mutational processes in all species, including 5-methylcytosine deamination and oxidative damage. With some differences, mutational signatures in other species resembled those described in humans, although the relative contribution of each signature varied across species. Remarkably, the somatic mutation rate per year varied greatly across species and exhibited a strong inverse relationship with species lifespan, with no other life-history trait studied displaying a comparable association. Despite widely different life histories among the species surveyed, including ~30-fold variation in lifespan and ~40,000-fold variation in body mass, the somatic mutation burden at the end of lifespan varied only by a factor of ~3. These data unveil common mutational processes across mammals and suggest that somatic mutation rates are evolutionarily constrained and may be a determinant of lifespan.</p>",2021-08-19

With NH residents’ poor initial vaccine response, the rise of NH breakthrough infections and outbreaks, characterization of the durability of immunity to inform public health policy on the need for boosting is needed. We report on humoral immunity from 2 weeks to 6-months post-vaccination in 120 NH residents and 92 ambulatory healthcare worker controls with and without pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, and serum neutralization titers, were assessed using a bead-based ELISA method and pseudovirus neutralization assay. Anti-spike, anti-RBD and neutralization levels dropped more than 80% over 6 months’ time in all groups irrespective of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. At 6 months post-vaccine, 72% of the infection-naive NH residents had neutralization titers at or below the lower limit of detection compared to 16% at 2 weeks after full vaccination. These data demonstrate a significant reduction in levels of antibody in all groups. In particular, those infection-naive NH residents had lower initial post-vaccination humoral immunity immediately and exhibited the greatest declines 6 months later. Healthcare workers, given their younger age and relative good-health, achieved higher initial antibody levels and better maintained them, yet also experienced significant declines in humoral immunity. Based on the rapid spread of the delta variant and reports of vaccine breakthrough in NH and among younger community populations, boosting NH residents may be warranted.</p>",2021-08-18

It has been proposed that extensive LCD-LCD interactions culminating in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of TFs is the dominant mechanism underlying transactivation. Here, we investigated how tuning the amount and localization of LCD-LCD interactions <italic>in vivo</italic> affects transcription of endogenous human genes. Quantitative single-cell and single-molecule imaging reveals that the oncogenic TF EWS/FLI1 requires a finely tuned range of LCD-LCD interactions to efficiently activate target genes. Modest or more dramatic increases in LCD-LCD interactions toward putative LLPS repress EWS/FLI1-driven transcription in patient cells. Likewise, ectopically creating LCD-LCD interactions to sequester EWS/FLI1 into a bona fide LLPS compartment, the nucleolus, inhibits EWS/FLI1-driven transcription and oncogenic transformation.

Nitrospira are thought to be well-adapted to substrate limitation owing to their high affinity for nitrite and capacity to use alternative energy sources. Here, we demonstrate that the canonical nitrite oxidizer Nitrospira moscoviensis oxidizes hydrogen (H2) below atmospheric levels using a high-affinity group 2a nickel-iron hydrogenase [Km(app) = 32 nM]. Atmospheric H2 oxidation occurred under both nitrite-replete and nitrite-deplete conditions, suggesting low-potential electrons derived from H2 oxidation promote nitrite-dependent growth and enable survival during nitrite limitation. Proteomic analyses confirmed the hydrogenase was abundant under both conditions and indicated extensive metabolic changes occur to reduce energy expenditure and growth under nitrite-deplete conditions. Respirometry analysis indicates the hydrogenase and nitrite oxidoreductase are bona fide components of the aerobic respiratory chain of N. moscoviensis, though they transfer electrons to distinct electron carriers in accord with the contrasting redox potentials of their substrates. Collectively, this study suggests atmospheric H2 oxidation enhances the growth and survival of NOB in amid variability of nitrite supply. These findings also extend the phenomenon of atmospheric H2 oxidation to a seventh phylum (Nitrospirota) and reveal unexpected new links between the global hydrogen and nitrogen cycles.</p>",2021-08-20

Here we present MultiVI, a probabilistic framework that leverages deep neural networks to jointly analyze scRNA, scATAC and multiomic (scRNA + scATAC) data. MultiVI creates an informative low-dimensional latent space that accurately reflects both chromatin and transcriptional properties of the cells even when one of the modalities is missing. MultiVI accounts for technical effects in both scRNA and scATAC-seq while correcting for batch effects in both data modalities. We use public datasets to demonstrate that MultiVI is stable, easy to use, and outperforms current approaches for the joint analysis of paired and unpaired data.

We measured vaccination coverage as the percent of the total population fully vaccinated as of July 15, 2021, with the exception of 11 Texas counties, where the cutoff date was July 14, 2021. We measured COVID-19 incidence as the number of confirmed cases per 100,000 population during the 14-day period ending August 12, 2021. We measured hospitalization rates as the number of confirmed COVID-19 admissions per 100,000 population during the same 14-day period. COVID-19 incidence was significantly higher among counties in the lower half of the distribution of vaccination coverage (incidence 543.8 per 100,000 among 56 counties with mean coverage 42.61%) than among counties in the upper half of the distribution of coverage (incidence 280.7 per 100,000 among 56 counties with mean coverage 57.37%, p &lt; 0.0001). Hospital admissions were also significantly higher among counties in the lower half of the distribution (55.37 per 100,000) than in the upper half of the distribution (20.48 per 100,000, p &lt; 0.0001). In log-linear regression models, a 10-percentage-point increase in vaccination coverage was associated with a 28.3% decrease in COVID-19 incidence (95% confidence interval, 16.8 - 39.7%), a 44.9 percent decrease in the rate of COVID-19 hospitalization (95% CI, 28.8 - 61.0%), and a 16.6% decrease in COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100 cases (95% CI, 8.4 - 24.8%).

Here, we asked whether such infra-slow oscillations arise as a noise-related epiphenomenon of limited processing capacity or, alternatively, represent a structured mechanism of perceptual inference. Using two large-scale datasets, we found that humans and mice waver between alternating intervals of externally- and internally-oriented modes of sensory analysis. During external mode, perception was more sensitive to external sensory information, whereas internal mode was characterized by enhanced biases toward perceptual history. Computational modeling indicated that dynamic changes in mode are governed by two interlinked factors: (i), the integration of subsequent stimuli over time and, (ii), infra-slow anti-phase oscillations in the perceptual impact of external sensory information versus internal predictions that are provided by perceptual history. Between-mode fluctuations may benefit perception by enabling the generation of stable representations of the environment despite an ongoing stream of noisy sensory inputs.</p>",2021-08-20

Here, we investigate whether reduced efficacy of selection increased mutation load in founder populations, or whether recessive deleterious mutations exposed to selection in homozygous genotypes were purged. Comparing the accumulation of synonymous and non-synonymous mutations across pairs of globally sampled genomes reveals that the most significant outliers are high latitude North Atlantic genomes, which have accumulated significantly fewer non-synonymous mutations than all other populations. Comparisons with the genome of a 7.5-Kyr-old North Atlantic killer whale, inferred to be closely related to the population directly ancestral to present-day Icelandic and Norwegian populations, calibrates the timing of the action of selection on non-synonymous mutations predominantly to the mid-late Holocene. Non-synonymous mutations purged in modern Norwegian killer whale genomes are found as globally shared standing variation in heterozygote genotypes more often than expected, suggesting overdominance. Taken together, our findings are consistent with purging of recessive non-synonymous mutations exposed to selection in founder-associated homozygous genotypes.</p>",2021-08-21

Wheeler'}, {'name': 'Arian F.A. Smit'}]","<p>The construction of a high-quality multiple sequence alignment (MSA) from copies of a transposable element (TE) is a critical step in the characterization of a new TE family. Most studies of MSA accuracy have been conducted on protein or RNA sequence families where structural features and strong signals of selection may assist with alignment. Less attention has been given to the quality of sequence alignments involving neutrally evolving DNA sequences such as those resulting from TE replication. Such alignments play an important role in understanding and representing TE family history. Transposable element sequences are challenging to align due to their wide divergence ranges, fragmentation, and predominantly-neutral mutation patterns. To gain insight into the effects of these properties on MSA accuracy, we developed a simulator of TE sequence evolution, and used it to generate a benchmark with which we evaluated the MSA predictions produced by several popular aligners, along with Refiner, a method we developed in the context of our RepeatModeler software. We find that MAFFT and Refiner generally outperform other aligners for low to medium divergence simulated sequences, while Refiner is uniquely effective when tasked with aligning high-divergent and fragmented instances of a family. As a result, consensus sequences derived from Refiner-based MSAs are more similar to the true consensus.</p>",2021-08-18

We then analyze the implications of this framework, uncovering how behavioural activity and experience replays can play complementary roles when learning the representation of the environment, how we can learn relations over behavioural timescales with synaptic plasticity acting on the range of milliseconds, and how the learned representation can be flexibly encoded by allowing state-dependent delay discounting through neuromodulation and altered firing rates.</p>",2021-08-17

We suggest that studies could be enriched by exploiting the possibilities afforded by a systematic analysis of PPG waveforms. To do this we initially require a robust and automated means of characterising it, thereby allowing us to examine variations across individuals and between different physiological and psychological contexts. We present a psychophysiologically-relevant model, the Hybrid Excess and Decay (HED) Model, which characterises pulse wave morphology in terms of three underlying pressure waves and a decay function. We show that these parameters capture PPG data with a high degree of precision and, moreover, are sensitive to specific, physiologically-relevant changes within individuals. We present the theoretical and practical basis for the model and demonstrate its performance when applied to a pharmacological dataset of 105 participants receiving intravenous administrations of the sympathomimetic drug isoproterenol (Isoprenaline).

We previously found suggestive evidence that OFC and PL could compensate for each other in this task, and we more directly assessed this potential compensation here. In Experiment 1, rats received OFC, PL, combined OFC+PL, or sham lesions and then completed our devaluation task. The OFC+PL lesion group exhibited impaired devaluation. In Experiment 2, rats received cholera-toxin-b (CTb) into OFC and either neurotoxic or sham PL lesions. Rats were then sacrificed on the last training day to double-label for Arc and CTb. We found increased Arc+CTb in mediodorsal thalamus (MD) and increased Arc+ neurons in OFC when PL was lesioned, suggesting that PL lesions lead to a compensatory increased activation of the MD→OFC circuit.

Neural compensation is commonly observed in human research but only a few models of neural compensation exist, and few identify compensation within the prefrontal cortex. This research is among the first to show neural compensation between prefrontal cortex regions and implicate a thalamocortical circuit in modulating this compensation. Not only will this model provide a way to behaviorally identify subtle neurological shifts, it can also elucidate basic neurological mechanisms that mediate how circuits interact with each other and how dysfunction in one circuit can affect connectivity in other brain areas.</p></sec>",2021-08-19

Established multiple alignment-based algorithms are inefficient for large scale metagenomic sequence data because of their high requirement of inter-sequence correlation and high computational complexity. In this paper, we present SeqDistK, a novel tool for alignment-free phylogenetic analysis. SeqDistK computes the dissimilarity matrix for phylogenetic analysis, incorporating seven k-mer based dissimilarity measures, namely d2, d2S, d2star, Euclidean, Manhattan, CVTree, and Chebyshev. Based on these dissimilarities, SeqDistK constructs phylogenetic tree using the Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean algorithm. Using a golden standard dataset of 16S rRNA and its associated phylogenetic tree, we compared SeqDistK to Muscle – a multi sequence aligner. We found SeqDistK was not only 38 times faster than Muscle in computational efficiency but also more accurate. SeqDistK achieved the smallest symmetric difference between the inferred and ground truth trees with a range between 13 to 18, while that of Muscle was 62. When measures d2, d2star, d2S, Euclidean, and k-mer size k=5 were used, SeqDistK consistently inferred phylogenetic tree almost identical to the ground truth tree. We also performed clustering of 16S rRNA sequences using SeqDistK and found the clustering was highly consistent with known biological taxonomy. Among all the measures, d2S (k=5, M=2) showed the best accuracy as it correctly clustered and classified all sample sequences.

Two challenges in identifying the immunodominant epitopes needed to generate a universal T cell influenza vaccine are: A lack of cell models susceptible to influenza infection which present population-prevalent HLA allotypes, and an absence of a reliable in-vitro method of identifying class II HLA peptides. Here we present a mass spectrometry-based proteomics strategy for identifying viral peptides derived from the A/H3N2/X31 and A/H3N2/Wisconsin/67/2005 strains of influenza. We compared the HLA-I and -II immunopeptidomes presented by ex-vivo influenza challenged human lung tissues. We then compared these with directly infected immortalised macrophage-like cell line (THP1) and primary dendritic cells fed apoptotic influenza-infected respiratory epithelial cells. In each of the three experimental conditions we identified novel influenza class I and II HLA peptides with motifs specific for the host allotype. Ex-vivo infected lung tissues yielded few class-II HLA peptides despite significant numbers of alveolar macrophages, including directly infected ones, present within the tissues. THP1 cells presented HLA-I viral peptides derived predominantly from internal proteins. Primary dendritic cells presented predominantly viral envelope-derived HLA class II peptides following phagocytosis of apoptotic infected cells. The most frequent viral source protein for HLA-I and -II was matrix 1 protein (M1). This work confirms that internal influenza proteins, particularly M1, are a rich source of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of two ex-vivo fully human infection models which enable direct HLA-I and -II immunopeptide identification without significant viral tropism limitations. Application of this epitope discovery strategy in a clinical setting will provide more certainty in rational vaccine design against influenza and other emergent viruses.</p><sec><title>Author Summary</title><p>Influenza infections present a significant global health challenge. High rates of mutation require reformulation of vaccines annually. Vaccines are designed to induce antibody responses to the surface proteins of the influenza virus, but the contribution of T cells to overall immunity is unclear. Here, we used several totally human laboratory models to show how the viral proteins are presented to the T cells to induce immunity. We found that CD8 T cells, which kill infected cells, and CD4 T cells which support the CD8 T cells as well as the antibody-producing B cells, mainly see proteins from inside the viral particle, not the surface ones which are targeted by antibodies. These internal viral proteins are more similar between different viral strains than the surface proteins, and therefore suggest that vaccines designed to induce T cell responses could be better protective if they target internal viral proteins.</p></sec>",2021-08-17

The process of recognition and internalization of the particulates may trigger changes in the function of phagocytes. Some of these changes, especially the ability of a particle-loaded phagocyte to take up and neutralize pathogens, remains poorly studied. Herein, we demonstrate that the uptake of non-stimulatory cargo-free particles enhances the phagocytic ability of monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. The enhancement in phagocytic ability was independent of particle properties, such as size or the base material constituting the particle. Additionally, we show that the increased phagocytosis was not a result of cellular activation or cellular heterogeneity but was driven by changes in cell membrane fluidity and cellular compliance.

To assess the mechanisms underlying these differences, we generated isogenic fibroblast lines expressing either PAX-FOXO1 paralog.

Altogether, our results argue that the diversity of rhabdomyosarcoma manifestation arises, in part, from the divergence between the transcriptional activities of PAX3-FOXO1 and PAX7-FOXO1.

Here we optimize an in vitro experimental model allowing us to record SD without focal stimulation. This method uses electrophysiological recordings and intrinsic optical imaging in slices. The method is also relatively easy and inexpensive. Acute hippocampal slices from mice or rats were prepared and used for extracellular and whole-cell recordings. Recordings were made in a submerged-style chamber with flow of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) above and below the slices. Flow was fast (&gt; 5ml/min), and temperature was 32°C. As soon as slices were placed in the chamber, aCSF containing 0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and 5 mM K<sup>+</sup> (0 Mg<sup>2+</sup>/5 K<sup>+</sup> aCSF) was used.

How promoter directionality is controlled remains poorly understood. We show that the chromatin remodelling complex RSC and general regulatory factors (GRFs) dictate promoter directionality by attenuating divergent transcription. Depletion of RSC increased divergent noncoding transcription and decreased protein-coding transcription at promoters with strong directionality. Consistent with RSC’s role in regulating chromatin, RSC depletion impacts nucleosome occupancy upstream of the nucleosome depleted region where divergent transcription initiates, suggesting that nucleosome positioning at the 5’ border of gene promoters physically blocks the recruitment of the transcription machinery and inhibits initiation of divergent transcription. Highly directional promoters were also enriched for the binding of GRFs such as Reb1 and Abf1. Furthermore, ectopic targeting of divergent transcription initiation sites with GRFs or the dCas9 protein can suppress divergent transcription. Our data suggest that RSC-mediated nucleosome positioning and GRFs play a pervasive role in repressing divergent transcription. We propose that any DNA binding factor, when stably associated with cryptic transcription start sites, can form a barrier for repressing divergent transcription.

Studies focus on pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and complications during the early phase of the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Long-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients who discharge intensive care unit (ICU) are unclear. 
Objectives
We investigated the effect of COVID-19 on lung structure, pulmonary functional, exercise capacity and quality of life in patients discharge from ICU and medical ward.
Methods
A prospective single-centre study conducted in PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients who has been discharged from University of Health Sciences, Dr. Suat Seren Chest Disease and Thoracic Surgery Teaching and Research Hospital between 15 January and 5 March 2021. Patients who followed up for more than 48 hours in ICU and more than 72 hours in medical ward were included the study. Computed tomography scores, pulmonary functional tests (PFT), 6-min walking distance and health related quality of life by SF-36 were compared between ICU and medical ward patients at 6 months after discharge.
Results	
	Seventy patients were included final analyses and 31 of them discharged from ICU. ICU patients had higher CT scores than non-ICU patients at admission (17 vs 11) and follow up visit (6 vs 0). Two-three of ICU patients had at least one abnormal finding at control CT. Advanced age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.15) and higher CT score at admission (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.27) were risk factors for having radiological abnormalities at control CT.  
Conclusion
	A number of COVID-19 survivors especially with severe disease could not fully recover after 6 months of hospital discharge.</p>",2021-08-20

Due to its vasodilatory effect and short half-life, the use of NO as an exogenous inhaled medication (iNO) to target the pulmonary vasculature, in conditions with increased pulmonary vascular resistance, has been studied. 
The use of iNO in patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 has therapeutic importance in improving oxygenation. It also has potential anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic properties.
Herein, we want to share our experience of use of iNO in hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID 19 pneumonia. We hypothesized that iNO may be beneficial at preventing intubation, decreasing invasive mechanical ventilation duration, and consequently improve outcomes including hospital mortality.

Methods: This is a descriptive hypothesis generating study of patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia who received iNO for hypoxemic respiratory failure, at a single tertiary care center. We collected information on patient demographics, co-morbidities, iNO treatment, need for intubation, arterial blood gas analysis, laboratory values, hospital length of stay, and mortality. Patients were divided into two groups based on the timing of iNO administration: group 1 - pre-intubation (i.e. iNO started at least 1 day prior to endotracheal intubation, if any) and group 2 - post-intubation (i.e. iNO started on the same day as or after endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation). 

Result: A total of 45 (group 1, n=26 [57.8%] vs group2, n=19 [42.2%]) COVID 19 patients who had iNO use. The mean time from hospital admission to iNO administration(days) in group 1 was 2.1 (1.8, SD) vs 4.2 (5.9, SD) in group 2. The mean hospital length of stay from the beginning of iNO treatment until discharge or death was 18.3 vs 26.2 days, with 8 deaths (30.8%) vs 9 deaths (47.4%) in group 1 vs group 2, respectively. 
Discussion:
Our study is unable to demonstrate comparably outcomes benefit of iNO. Although there was a trend towards decreased  need for  invasive mechanical ventilation in group 1[Only 11 (42.3 %) patients were intubated out of 26 who received iNO early after hospital admission (2.3 days)], no statistical significance could be achieved because of small sample size. 
Our study demonstrated that iNO administration pre-intubation did not appear harmful and appears to be safe, complementary to HFNC,  signalling the domain where systematic investigation is required to confirm or not the potential for iNO to improve patient outcomes in the management of COVID  19-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure.
Conclusion:

This promise, however, may be undermined by defaunation driven by ubiquitous wildlife trapping in the region, particularly for forest birds that are part of the multi-million-dollar pet trade. To date, quantification of the impacts of trade-driven trapping on rates of biodiversity recovery from forest restoration has been limited. Here, we use a unique long-term survey dataset to ask how trade-driven trapping may interfere with the expected recovery of avian community under forest restoration, at a flagship ecosystem restoration site in the lowland rainforests of Sumatra, Indonesia. We show that tropical forest restoration is associated with the increases in the abundance of 88% of bird species over time. However, impacts of trapping within more accessible areas of the forest meant that this recovery was dampened for 74% of bird species, relative to levels expected as a result of the magnitude of forest recovery observed. Most species (80%) showed increasingly positive relationships between abundance and site remoteness over the period, a pattern that was found for both species targeted for the pet trade (85% of species) and those trapped opportunistically or as 'bycatch' (78% of species). We emphasize the urgency of tackling the emerging threat of pet trade to Southeast Asia's avian diversity, not least to ensure the effectiveness of efforts towards forest restoration.</p>",2021-08-20

The SARS-CoV-2 surface Spike (S) glycoprotein represents a prime target for vaccine development because antibodies that block viral attachment and entry, i.e. neutralizing antibodies, bind almost exclusively to the receptor binding domain (RBD). Here, we develop computational models for a large subset of S proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2, implemented through coarse-grained elastic network models and normal mode analysis. We then analyze local protein domain dynamics of the S protein systems and their thermal stability to characterize structural and dynamical variability among them.

While transcription induction of many metal transport systems, purines, biotin, PhoPQ and SPI-2 regulons was common in both intracellular SPA and STM, we identified 234 differentially expressed genes that showed distinct expression patterns in intracellular SPA vs. STM. Surprisingly, clear expression differences were found in SPI-1, motility and chemotaxis, and carbon (mainly citrate, galactonate and ethanolamine) utilization pathways, indicating that these pathways are regulated and possibly function differently, during their intracellular phase. Moreover, we show that the induction of flagella genes by intracellular SPA leads to cytosolic motility, a conserved trait specific to SPA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a flagellum-dependent intracellular motility of any Salmonella serovar in living host cells. Importantly, we demonstrate that the elevated expression of SPI-1 and motility genes by intracellular SPA results in increased invasiveness of SPA, following exit from host cells. We propose that such changes prime SPA towards new cycles of host cell infection and contribute to the ability of SPA to disseminate beyond the intestinal lamina propria of the human host, during enteric fever.</p>",2021-08-18

These signatures can quantify therapeutically-relevant as well as accidental radiation exposures. The prodromal symptoms of Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) overlap some viral infections. We recently showed that these radiation signatures produced unexpected false positive misclassification of influenza and dengue infected samples. The present study investigates these and other confounders, and then mitigates their effects on signature accuracy.
Methods: This study investigated recall by previous and novel radiation signatures independently derived from multiple Gene Expression Omnibus datasets on common and rare non-malignant blood disorders and blood-borne infections (thromboembolism, S. aureus bacteremia, malaria, sickle cell disease, polycythemia vera, and aplastic anemia). Normalized expression levels of signature genes are used as input to machine learning-based classifiers to predict radiation exposure in other hematological conditions. 
Results: Except for aplastic anemia, these confounders modify the normal baseline expression values, leading to false-positive misclassification of radiation exposures in 8 to 54% of individuals. Shared changes were predominantly in DNA damage response and apoptosis-related gene transcripts in radiation and confounding hematological conditions compromise the utility of these signatures for radiation assessment. These confounding conditions are known to induce neutrophil extracellular traps, initiated by chromatin decondensation, fragmentation and often, programmed cell death. Ribovirus infections are proposed to deplete RNA binding proteins, inducing R-loops in chromatin which collide with replication forks resulting in DNA damage and apoptosis. To mitigate the effects of confounders, we evaluated predicted radiation positive samples with novel gene expression signatures derived from radiation-responsive transcripts of secreted blood plasma proteins whose expression levels are unperturbed in these confounding conditions. 
Conclusions: This approach identifies and eliminates misclassified samples with underlying hematological or infectious conditions, leaving only samples with true radiation exposures. Diagnostic accuracy is significantly improved by selecting genes that maximize both sensitivity and specificity in the appropriate tissue using combinations of the best signatures for each of these classes of signatures.</p>",2021-08-19

Yet where nests commonly receive more than one cuckoo egg, hosts might benefit by instead accepting parasite eggs. This is because cuckoos remove an egg from the nest before adding their own, and keeping cuckoo eggs in the nest reduces the odds that further host eggs are removed by subsequent cuckoos. This ‘clutch dilution effect’ has been proposed as a precondition for the evolution of cuckoo nestling eviction by hosts, but no previous studies have tested this in a host that rejects cuckoo nestlings. We tested the clutch dilution hypothesis in large-billed gerygones (<italic>Gerygone magnirostris</italic>), which are multiply parasitized by little bronze-cuckoos (<italic>Chalcites minutillus</italic>).

Yet gerygones were also flexible in their egg acceptance, with 35% abandoning cuckoo-egg-only clutches.

Methods: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using a nationwide healthcare claims database of South Korea as of May 15, 2020. Confirmed COVID-19 infection in hospitalized individuals aged 40 years or older were included for analysis. We defined exposure variable by using inpatient and outpatient prescription records of immunosuppressants from the database. Our primary outcome was a composite endpoint of all-cause death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation use. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted logistic regression analyses were used, to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals, comparing immunosuppressants users and non-users.
 
Findings: We identified 4,349 patients, for which 1,356 were immunosuppressants users and 2,903 were non-users. Patients who used immunosuppressants were at increased odds of the primary outcome of all-cause death, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation use (IPTW OR 1.32; 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.63).

We describe the advantages of existing methods to analyze heterogeneous datasets,  using Parkinson's Disease (PD) as a case study. Parkinson's disease is associated with both genetic and neuroimaging factors, however such imaging genetics associations are at an early investigation stage. Therefore it is desirable to have a  free and open source workflow that integrates different analysis flows  in order to recover potential genetic biomarkers in PD, as in other complex diseases.</p>",2021-08-19

Modern machine learning approaches, however, have the potential to automate a variety of tasks, which until recently could only be performed manually. Unfortunately, the application of such methods by researchers outside the field is hampered by technical difficulties, some of which, we believe, can be avoided. Here, we present GinJinn2, a user-friendly toolbox for deep learning-based object detection and instance segmentation on image data. Besides providing a convenient command-line interface to existing software libraries, it comprises several additional tools for data handling, pre- and postprocessing, and building advanced analysis pipelines. We demonstrate the application of GinJinn2 for biological purposes using four exemplary analyses, namely the evaluation of seed mixtures, detection of insects on glue traps, segmentation of stomata, and extraction of leaf silhouettes from herbarium specimens. GinJinn2 will enable users with a primary background in biology to apply deep learning-based methods for object detection and segmentation in order to automate feature extraction from image data.</p>",2021-08-20

The highly conserved C-terminal (CCT) domains of SPAK and OSR1 bind to RFx[V/I] peptide sequences from their upstream With No Lysine Kinases (WNKs), facilitating their activation via phosphorylation. Thus, the inhibition of SPAK and OSR1 binding, via their CCT domains, to WNK kinases is a plausible strategy for inhibiting SPAK and OSR1 kinases. To facilitate structure-guided drug design of such inhibitors, we expressed and purified human SPAK and OSR1 CCT domains and solved their crystal structures. We also employed a biophysical strategy and determined the affinity of SPAK and OSR1 CCT domains to an 18-mer peptide derived from WNK4. Together, the crystal structures and affinity data reported herein provide a robust platform to facilitate the design of CCT domain specific small molecule inhibitors of SPAK-activation by WNK kinases, potentially leading to new improved treatments for hypertension and ischemic stroke.</p>",2021-08-19

Previous studies show that the Wnt pathway regulates proliferation, promotes medial compartment formation in the cochlea, differentiation of the mechanosensory hair cells and axon guidance of Type II afferent neurons. WNT ligand expressions are highly dynamic throughout development but are insufficient to explain the roles of the Wnt pathway. We address a potential way for how WNTs specify the medial compartment by characterizing the expression of Porcupine (PORCN), an O-acyltransferase that palmitoylates WNT ligands for secretion. We show PORCN expression across embryonic ages (E)12.5 - E14.5, E16.5, and postnatal day (P)1.  Our results showed enriched PORCN in the medial domains during early stages of development, indicating that WNTs have a stronger influence on patterning of the medial compartment. PORCN was rapidly downregulated after E14.5, following the onset of sensory cell differentiation; residual expression remained in some hair cells and supporting cells. On E14.5 and E16.5, we also examined the spatial expression of Gsk3β, an inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling to determine its potential role in radial patterning of the cochlea. Gsk3β was broadly expressed across the radial axis of the epithelium; therefore, unlikely to control WNT-mediated medial specification. In conclusion, the spatial expression of PORCN enriches WNT secretion from the medial domains of the cochlea to influence the specification of cell fates in the medial sensory domain.</p>",2021-08-20

Close connection and mutual influence in this communication allow to talk about the self-adjusting “plant-rhizosphere community” system, which should be be studied in connection. Diversity estimation is one of the ways of describing both bacterial and plant communities. Based on the literature, there are two assumptions of how the diversity of plant communities related to the diversity of bacterial communities: 1) an increase in the species richness of plants leads to an increase in the number of available micro-niches, and increasing of microbial diversity, 2) an increase in the species richness of plants is accompanied by the predominant development of bacteria from highly productive specific taxa and decreasing in the diversity of microorganisms. Experimental studies show controversial results.</p><p>We analyzed field sites (rye crop field and two fallow sites), using DNA isolation of both the plant root mass (followed by sequencing of the ITS1 region) and rhizosphere microorganisms (followed by sequencing of the 16s rDNA V4 region).

Alpha-diversity connection should be explored in similar plant communities, such as synusia. We hypothesize, that the significant differences in plant abundances lead to significant changes in exudation profiles, and the loss of diversity connection. The beta-diversity between rhizosphere communities and plant communities is highly correlated, in particular in terms of the abundance of taxa. This can be explained by a potential correlation (as reported in the literature) or by the presence of statistical artifacts.</p>",2021-08-19

Lack of GAK/Aux promotes autophagic induction, disrupts lysosome acidification, and blocks glial clearance of substrates. Aux regulates Atg9 trafficking to autophagosomes and lysosomes for autophagosome biogenesis and autolysosome maturation, respectively, via Atg9 phosphorylation at newly identified residues T62 and T69.

Auguste'}, {'name': 'Lucas Cheadle'}]","<p>Cytokine signaling between microglia and neurons is required for synapse elimination during brain development, but the mechanisms by which neurons respond to microglia-derived cytokines remain to be fully defined. Here, we demonstrate that microglia are necessary for sensory experience-dependent synapse elimination in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the mouse, a process previously shown to be mediated by the microglia-derived cytokine TWEAK and its neuronal receptor Fn14. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing in mice lacking Fn14 or TWEAK at the height of experience-dependent refinement revealed that TWEAK-Fn14 signaling coordinates robust programs of gene expression in excitatory thalamocortical neurons of the dLGN. Gene targets of TWEAK and Fn14 are enriched for regulators of synapse and chromatin remodeling, suggesting that TWEAK-Fn14 signaling coordinates neuronal transcription to promote circuit refinement and epigenomic maturation in response to experience. We further find that Fn14 expression is not restricted to the dLGN but extends to other brain regions as well, both during development and in the adult. Consistent with the expression of Fn14 outside of the visual system, Fn14 knockout mice show significant impairments in multiple tests of memory task proficiency. At baseline, loss of Fn14 does not affect macroscopic neural activity measured by electroencephalogram recordings <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, mice lacking Fn14 displayed worse seizure outcomes and were less likely to survive when seizures were pharmacologically induced. Thus, TWEAK-Fn14 signaling coordinates neuronal transcription during development and contributes to cognitive function in the adult.

TEPS generates sequences of peaks and statistically scores them according to: 1) peak time coherence across channels; 2) peak prominence; 3) temporal regularity; and 4) number of skipped beats. TEPS was tested on 31 records of three channel capacitive electrode data from the UnoViS automobile database. TEPS showed a sensitivity (SE) of 91.3% and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 3.0% compared to an SE and FDR of 75.3% and 65.0% respectively for a conventional single channel detector (OSEA) applied separately to the three channels. The peak matching window was 30ms. The percentage of 5 second segments with average heart rates within 5 beats/minute of reference was also measured. In 6 of the 31 records, TEPS’ percentage was at least 30% greater than OSEA’s. TEPS was also applied to synthetic data comprising a known signal corrupted with calibrated amounts of noise. At a fixed SE of 85%, increasing the number of channels from one to two resulted in an improvement of approximately 5dB in noise resistance, while increasing the number of channels from two to four resulted in an improvement of approximately 3dB in noise resistance.
