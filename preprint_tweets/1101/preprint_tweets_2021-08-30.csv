Nash'}, {'name': 'Yang Xu'}, {'name': 'Job Dekker'}, {'name': 'Rachel Patton McCord'}]","<p>Layers of genome organization are becoming increasingly better characterized, but less is known about how these structures respond to perturbation or shape changes. Low-salt swelling of isolated chromatin fibers or nuclei has been used for decades to investigate the structural properties of chromatin. But, visible changes in chromatin appearance have not been linked to known building blocks of genome structure or features along the genome sequence. We combine low-salt swelling of isolated nuclei with genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and imaging approaches to probe the effects of chromatin extension genome-wide. Photoconverted patterns on nuclei during expansion and contraction indicate that global genome structure is preserved after dramatic nuclear volume swelling, suggesting a highly elastic chromosome topology. Hi-C experiments before, during, and after nuclear swelling show changes in average contact probabilities at short length scales, reflecting the extension of the local chromatin fiber. But, surprisingly, during this large increase in nuclear volume, there is a striking maintenance of loops, TADs, active and inactive compartments, and chromosome territories. Subtle differences after expansion are observed, suggesting that the local chromatin state, protein interactions, and location in the nucleus can affect how strongly a given structure is maintained under stress. From these observations, we propose that genome topology is robust to extension of the chromatin fiber and isotropic shape change, and that this elasticity may be beneficial in physiological circumstances of changes in nuclear size and volume.</p>",2021-08-23

We found that sera from Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine remain high reactivity toward the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Delta variant while it drops dramatically toward that of Lambda variant. Interestingly, the overall titer of antibodies of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinated individuals drops 3-fold after 6 months, which could be one of major reasons for breakthrough infections, emphasizing the importance of potential third boost shot. While a therapeutic antibody, Bamlanivimab, decreases binding affinity to Delta variant by ~20 fold, it fully lost binding to Lambda variant. Structural modeling of complexes of RBD with human receptor, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), and Bamlanivimab suggest the potential basis of the change of binding.

Luedeke'}, {'name': 'Leslie Brown'}, {'name': 'Aaron M. Zorn'}]","<p>WNT/ß-catenin signaling regulates gene expression across numerous biological contexts including development, stem cell homeostasis and tissue regeneration, and dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in many diseases including cancer. One fundamental question is how distinct WNT target genes are activated in a context-specific manner, given the dogma that most, if not all, WNT/ß-catenin responsive transcription is mediated by TCF/LEF transcription factors (TFs) that have similar DNA-binding specificities. Here we show that the SOX family of TFs direct lineage-specific WNT/ß-catenin responsive transcription during the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into definitive endoderm (DE) and neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs). Using time-resolved multi-omics analyses, we show that ß-catenin association with chromatin is highly dynamic, colocalizing with distinct TCFs and/or SOX TFs at distinct stages of differentiation, indicating both cooperative and competitive modes of genomic interactions. We demonstrate that SOX17 and SOX2 are required to recruit ß-catenin to hundreds of lineage-specific WNT-responsive enhancers, many of which are not occupied by TCFs. At a subset of these TCF-independent enhancers, SOX TFs are required to both establish a permissive chromatin landscape and recruit a WNT-enhanceosome complex that includes ß-catenin, BCL9, PYGO and transcriptional coactivators to direct SOX/ß-catenin-dependent transcription. Given that SOX TFs are expressed in almost every cell type, these results have broad mechanistic implications for the specificity of WNT responses across many developmental and disease contexts.</p>",2021-08-26

McEntee'}, {'name': 'J. Gordon Burleigh'}, {'name': 'Renée A. Duckworth'}]","<p>A long-standing hypothesis in evolutionary biology is that the evolution of resource specialization can lead to an evolutionary dead end, where specialists have low diversification rates and limited ability to evolve into generalists. However, in recent years, advances in comparative methods investigating trait-based differences associated with diversification have enabled more robust tests of this idea and have found mixed support. Here we test the evolutionary dead end hypothesis by estimating net diversification rate differences associated with nest site specialization among 3,224 species of passerine birds. In particular, we test whether the adoption of hole-nesting, a nest site specialization that decreases predation, results in reduced diversification rates relative to nesting outside of holes. Further, we examine whether evolutionary transitions to the specialist hole-nesting state have been more frequent than transitions out of hole-nesting. Using diversification models that accounted for background rate heterogeneity and different extinction rate scenarios, we found that hole-nesting specialization was not associated with diversification rate differences. Furthermore, contrary to the assumption that specialists rarely evolve into generalists, we found that transitions out of hole-nesting occur more frequently than transitions into hole-nesting. These results suggest that interspecific competition may limit adoption of hole-nesting, but that such competition does not result in limited diversification of hole-nesters. In conjunction with other recent studies using robust comparative methods, our results add to growing evidence that evolutionary dead ends are not a typical outcome of resource specialization.</p>",2021-08-25

Although severe COVID-19 has been shown to be associated with immune activation at the maternal-fetal interface even in the absence of active viral replication, the immune response to asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 remains unknown. Here, we assessed immunological adaptations in both blood and term decidua from 9 SARS-exposed pregnant women with asymptomatic/mild disease and 15 pregnant SARS-naive women. In addition to selective loss of tissue-resident decidual macrophages, we report attenuation of antigen presentation and type I IFN signaling but upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in blood monocyte derived decidual macrophages. On the other hand, infection was associated with remodeling of the T cell compartment with increased frequencies of activated CD69+ tissue-resident T cells and decreased abundance of Tregs. Interestingly, frequencies of cytotoxic CD4 and CD8 T cells increased only in the blood, while CD8 effector memory T cells were expanded in the decidua. In contrast to decidual macrophages, signatures of type I IFN signaling were increased in decidual T cells. Finally, T cell receptor diversity was significantly reduced with infection in both compartments, albeit to a much greater extent in the blood. The resulting aberrant immune activation in the placenta, even with asymptomatic disease may alter the exquisitely sensitive developing fetal immune system, leading to long-term adverse outcomes for offspring.</p>",2021-08-23

The model was designed to predict brain activity measured using functional MRI (fMRI) by weighted linear summations of the spatiotemporal visual features that appear in the video stimuli (video features). Two types of video features were used: (1) motion-energy features designed based on neurophysiological findings, and (2) features derived from a space-time vision transformer (TimeSformer). To utilize the features of various video domains, the features of the TimeSformer models pre-trained using several different movie sets were combined. Through these model building and validation processes, results showed that there is a certain correspondence between the hierarchical representation of the TimeSformer model and the hierarchical representation of the visual system in the brain. The motion-energy features are effective in predicting brain activity in the early visual areas, while TimeSformer-derived features are effective in higher-order visual areas, and a hybrid model that uses motion energy and TimeSformer features is effective for predicting whole brain activity.</p>",2021-08-23

It mostly functions in restricting expression of repeats, mobile elements such as transposons and other regions. The establishment, maintenance and spreading of heterochromatin requires several factors including chromatin modifiers. However, how exactly heterochromatin formation is avoided in protein-coding domains is poorly understood. Here we show that a plant specific paralogue of RNA polymerase (pol) II, named pol IV, is involved in avoidance of facultative heterochromatic marks in protein coding genes, in addition to silencing the repeats and transposons forming constitutive heterochromatin. In its absence, H3K27 trimethylation mark intrudes the protein coding genes, more profoundly in genes embedded with repeats. In a subset of genes that lack the compensatory silencing, spurious transcriptional activity results in small(s)RNA production leading to post-transcriptional gene silencing. We show that such effects are significantly pronounced in rice, a plant with larger genome with distributed heterochromatin when compared to Arabidopsis.

Tracheal tube fusion in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is mediated by tip cells that transform into lumenized toroids to connect adjacent tubes. This process depends on the Munc13-4 orthologue Staccato (Stac), which localizes to tip-cell-specific lysosome-related organelles (LROs) that display features of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). We show that the tracheal lumen contains membranous extracellular vesicles (EVs), a subset of which carries Stac/Munc13-4 and is associated with tracheal anastomosis sites. The presence of LROs and luminal Stac-EVs depends on the tip-cell-specific GTPase Arl3, suggesting that Stac-EVs derive from fusion of MVBs with the luminal membrane in tip cells during anastomosis formation. The GTPases Rab27 and Rab35 cooperate downstream of Arl3 to promote Stac-MVB formation and tube fusion. We propose that Stac-MVBs act as membrane reservoirs that facilitate lumen fusion in tip cells, in a process regulated by Arl3, Rab27, Rab35, and Stac/Munc13-4.</p>",2021-08-23

Koch'}, {'name': 'Endao Han'}, {'name': 'Joshua W. Shaevitz'}, {'name': 'Zemer Gitai'}]","<p>The ability of eukaryotic cells to differentiate substrate stiffness is fundamental for many processes such as the development of stem cells into mature tissue. Here, we establish that bacteria feel their microenvironment in a similar manner. We show that <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> actively probes and measures substrate stiffness using type IV pili (TFP). The activity of the major virulence factor regulator Vfr is peaked with stiffness in a physiologically important range between 0.1 kPa (mucus) and 1000 kPa (cartilage). The local concentration of PilA at the base of dynamic TFP changes during extension and retraction in a surface dependent manner due to slow PilA diffusion in the cell membrane. Traction force measurements reveal that TFP retraction deforms even stiff substrates. Modeling of the measured substrate deformation and optical tweezers experiments suggest that TFP adhere at the tip only. Informed by these experimental results, we developed a model that describes substrate stiffness dependent dynamics of the polar PilA concentration which are quantitatively consistent with the transcriptional response to stiffness. Manipulating the ATPase activity of the TFP motors changes the TFP extension and retraction velocities and consequently the PilA concentration dynamics in a manner that is predictive of the experimental stiffness response. This work points to the use of a competition between PilA diffusion and TFP extension-retraction as a molecular shear rheometer. Our results highlight that stiffness sensing is a conserved property between the kingdoms of life.</p>",2021-08-26

However, demographic parameters and biogeographic distributions do not preserve directly in the archaeological record. Rather than attempting to estimate human abundance at some specific time in the past, a principled approach to making inferences at this scale is to ask what the human demography and biogeography of a hypothetical planet Earth would look like if populated by ethnographic hunter-gatherer societies.

We found that iPSC-microglia lacking TREM2 (TREM2 KO) show exaggerated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in response to purinergic agonists such as ADP that shape microglial injury responses. This ADP hypersensitivity, driven by increased expression of P2Y12 and P2Y13 receptors, results in sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and alters cell motility and process extension in TREM2 KO microglia. In a “Ca<sup>2+</sup> clamp” assay using iPSC-microglia expressing the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe, Salsa6f, we found that cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> tunes motility to a greater extent in TREM2 KO microglia. Despite showing greater overall displacement, TREM2 KO microglia exhibit reduced directional chemotaxis along ADP gradients. Accordingly, the chemotactic defect in TREM2 KO microglia was rescued by reducing cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> using a P2Y12 receptor antagonist. Our results show that loss of TREM2 confers a defect in microglial Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to purinergic signals, suggesting a window of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling for optimal microglial motility.</p>",2021-08-24
