AAVs are widely used in research and are the basis of multiple FDA-approved gene therapies. Here, we find that the immune response to AAV’s genome reduces dendritic complexity in mammalian cortex. Dendritic loss associated with AAV-mediated gene delivery occurs at experimentally-relevant titers, cannot be explained by responses to transgene expression or surgery, and is not restricted to a particular capsid serotype, encoded transgene, promoter, or production facility. AAV-associated dendritic loss is accompanied by a decrease in the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and upregulation of immune molecules that can limit dendritic complexity and synaptic transmission. Blocking detection of unmethylated CpG-rich DNA via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) protects dendritic complexity, suggesting that immunodetection of a core feature of the AAV genome triggers dendritic loss. These results reveal previously unsuspected impacts of AAV on neuronal structure and function and identify TLR9 inhibitors as important tools to improve the safety and efficacy of AAV-mediated gene delivery in the nervous system.</p>",2021-09-30

Here, we used untargeted metabolomics to examine novel metabolic pathways related to SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 clinical severity using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (CE-TOF-MS) in plasma samples. We included 27 patients with confirmed COVID-19 early after symptom onset who were prospectively followed and 29 healthcare workers heavily exposed to SARS-CoV-2 but with low susceptibility to infection (‘nonsusceptible’). We found that the metabolite profile was predictive of the study group. We identified a total of 55 metabolites as biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility or COVID-19 clinical severity. We report the discovery of new plasma biomarkers for COVID-19 that provide mechanistic explanations for the clinical consequences of SARS-CoV-2, including mitochondrial and liver dysfunction as a consequence of hypoxemia (citrulline, citrate, and BAIBA), energy production and amino acid catabolism (L-glycine, L-alanine, L-serine, L-proline, L-aspartic acid and L-histidine), endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis (citrulline, L-ADMA, 2-AB, and Neu5Ac), and we found interconnections between these pathways.

When only one copy of a killer meiotic driver is found in a genome, the driver is expected to be transmitted to only half of the gametes (e.g. eggs or sperm).

Previous work showed that <italic>wtf</italic> meiotic drivers encode a poison protein that is transmitted to all spores and an antidote protein that rescues only spores that inherit the locus.

We also demonstrate that <italic>wtf4</italic> exploits an essential gene expression pathway, making it difficult for the genome to prevent this locus from being expressed and killing.

We show how these new sources of variation help understand the heterogeneity of the clinical behavior of MPM and drug responses measured in cell lines. These findings unearth the interplay between MPM functional biology and its genomic history, and ultimately, inform classification, prognostication and treatment.</p><sec><title>Graphical abstract</title><fig id=""ufig1"" position=""float"" orientation=""portrait"" fig-type=""figure""><graphic xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""461908v1_ufig1"" position=""float"" orientation=""portrait"" /></fig></sec>",2021-09-29

However, the methods typically used to assign regions to these networks typically force non- or minimal overlap between the networks, losing information about how particular regions may connect to multiple networks. However, new methods are emerging that allow networks to overlap. Here, we examined the reliability and validity of one such assignment method, the mixed membership algorithm, and the utility of overlapping assignment for identifying potential gaps in existing network models of behavior. Analyses were conducted on resting state data from a large set of participants. First, we split the data into two halves and generated group-level overlapping networks for each subgroup. We then used a bootstrapped Dice similarity analysis to demonstrate that the binarized network topographies showed good agreement between subgroups. Next, we generated nonoverlapping networks in the combined data using a typical k-means clustering method. Using the same Dice Similarity analysis, we compared these nonoverlapping networks both with previously published nonoverlapping networks (Yeo et al, 2011) and with overlapping networks likewise generated for the combined data. The nonoverlapping networks generally recapitulated known networks in the literature, and the overlapping networks captured large portions of one to three nonoverlapping network topographies. Following this, we used a relative entropy analysis to assess the uniformity of each region’s distribution of connections across the overlapping networks. While many regions were indeed assigned to one network, more were assigned to multiple networks. Furthermore, regions assigned to multiple networks did not necessarily show stronger connection to one network over the others. Finally, we assessed the network membership of regions of the fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular networks of the Dual-Networks model of cognitive control. In combination, the regions were members of all of the overlapping networks, and the majority were assigned to multiple networks. Together, these results indicate that overlapping assignment produces consistent and biologically plausible network topographies, and that a complete network model of cognitive control, or indeed any network model of behavior needs to be updated to account for multiple-network membership and the complex interactions that occur between the relevant networks as a function of their overlapping nature.</p>",2021-09-30

Next, participants were asked to verbally recall the movie events, taking into account the new “twist” information. Most participants updated their recall to incorporate the twist. Two additional groups recalled the movie without having to update their memories during recall: one group never saw the twist; another group was exposed to the twist prior to the beginning of the movie, and thus the twist information was incorporated both during encoding and recall. We found that providing participants with information about the twist beforehand altered neural response patterns during movie-viewing in the default mode network (DMN). Moreover, presenting participants with the twist at the end of the movie changed the neural representation of the previously-encoded information during recall in a subset of DMN regions. Further evidence for this transformation was obtained by comparing the neural activation patterns during encoding and recall and correlating them with behavioral signatures of memory updating.

We present a barcoding strategy that enables phenotypic screens of blood-feeding insects against small molecules in microtiter plate-based arrays and apply this to discovery of novel systemic insecticides and compounds that block malaria parasite development in the mosquito vector. Encoding of the bloodmeals was achieved through recombinant DNA-tagged <italic>Asaia</italic> bacteria that successfully colonized <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. An arrayed screen of a collection of pesticides showed that chemical classes of avermectins, phenylpyrazoles and neonicotinoids were enriched for compounds with systemic adulticide activity against <italic>Anopheles</italic>. Using a luminescent <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> reporter strain, barcoded screens identified 48 drug-like transmission blocking compounds from a 400-compound antimicrobial library. The approach significantly increases the throughput in phenotypic screening campaigns using adult insects, and identifies novel candidate small molecules for disease control.</p>",2021-09-30

Here we show that Neurofibromin-1 (Nf1) is not required in muscle fibers, but specifically in early postnatal myogenic progenitors (MPs), where Nf1 loss led to cell cycle exit and differentiation blockade, depleting the MP pool resulting in reduced myonuclear accrual as well as reduced muscle stem cell numbers. This was caused by precocious induction of stem cell quiescence coupled to metabolic reprogramming of MPs impinging on glycolytic shutdown, which was conserved in muscle fibers. We show that a Mek/Erk/NOS pathway hypersensitizes Nf1-deficient MPs to Notch signaling, consequently, early postnatal Notch pathway inhibition ameliorated premature quiescence, metabolic reprogramming and muscle growth. This reveals an unexpected role of Ras/Mek/Erk signaling supporting postnatal MP quiescence in concert with Notch signaling, which is controlled by Nf1 safeguarding coordinated muscle growth and muscle stem cell pool establishment. Furthermore, our data suggest transmission of metabolic reprogramming across cellular differentiation, affecting fiber metabolism and function in NF1.</p>",2021-09-30

As neurons primarily utilize glucose as their primary metabolic energy source, we generated mice with increased glycolysis in cholinergic neurons by specific deletion of the fructose-2,6-phosphatase protein TIGAR. Steady-state and stable isotope flux analyses demonstrated increased rates of glycolysis, acetyl-CoA production, acetylcholine levels and density of neuromuscular synaptic junction clusters with enhanced acetylcholine release. The increase in cholinergic signaling reduced blood pressure and heart rate with a remarkable resistance to cold-induced hypothermia. These data directly demonstrate that increased cholinergic signaling through the modulation of glycolysis has several metabolic benefits particularly to increase energy expenditure and heat production upon cold exposure.</p><sec><title>Highlights</title><list list-type=""order""><list-item><p>Deficiency of a negative regulator of glycolysis (TIGAR) in cholinergic neurons increases the biosynthesis and content of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Increased cholinergic tone reduces blood pressure and heart rate while enhancing signaling at neuromuscular junction.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Upregulation of neuromuscular junction activation provides protection against the paralytic curare and cold-induced hypothermia.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Modulation of cholinergic neuron glycolysis may provide a novel therapeutic approach for treatment of diseases stemming from reduced acetylcholine signaling such as myasthenia gravis and sarcopenic pre-synaptic dysfunction.</p></list-item></list></sec>",2021-09-30
