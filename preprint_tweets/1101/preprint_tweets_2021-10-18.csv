This emerging phenomenon was undeniable yet understudied. We investigated menstrual bleeding patterns among currently and formerly menstruating people, with a research design based off our expectations that these bleeding changes related to changes in clotting or inflammation, affecting normal menstrual repair. In this sample, 42% of people with regular menstrual cycles bled more heavily than usual, while 44% reported no change, after being vaccinated. Among people who typically do not menstruate, 71% of people on long-acting reversible contraceptives, 39% of people on gender-affirming hormones, and 66% of post-menopausal people reported breakthrough bleeding. We found increased/breakthrough bleeding was significantly associated with age, other vaccine side effects (fever, fatigue), history of pregnancy or birth, and ethnicity. Changes to menstrual bleeding are not uncommon nor dangerous, yet attention to these experiences is necessary to build trust in medicine.</p><sec><title>Teaser</title><p>Increased bleeding can occur post SARS-CoV-2 vaccines; this study characterizes patterns to enable future hypothesis testing.</p></sec>",2021-10-12

In this study, we determined the whole genomes of nine Japanese wolves from the 19<sup>th</sup>- early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries and 11 Japanese dogs and analyzed them along with both modern and ancient wolves and dogs. Genomic analyses indicate that the Japanese wolf was a unique subspecies of the gray wolf that was genetically distinct from both modern and ancient gray wolves, lacking gene flow with other gray wolves. A Phylogenetic tree that minimizes the effects of introgression shows that Japanese wolves are closest to the dog monophyletic group among the gray wolves. Moreover, Japanese wolves show significant genetic affinities with East Eurasian dogs. We estimated the level of introgression from the ancestor of the Japanese wolves to the ancestor of East Eurasian dogs that had occurred in the transitional period from the Pleistocene to the Holocene, at an early stage after divergence from West Eurasian dog lineages. Because of this introgression, Japanese wolf ancestry has been inherited by many dogs through admixture between East Eurasian dog lineages. As a result of this heredity, up to 5.5% of modern dog genomes throughout East Eurasia are derived from Japanese wolf ancestry.</p>",2021-10-11
2,10.1101/2021.10.16.464636,88,bioRxiv,Plant Biology,False,Automatic identification and annotation of MYB gene family members in plants,[{'name': 'Boas Pucker'}],"<p>Background: MYBs are among the largest transcription factor families in plants. Consequently, members of this family are involved in a plethora of processes including development and specialized metabolism. The MYB families of many plant species were investigated in the last two decades since the first investigation looked at Arabidopsis thaliana. This body of knowledge and characterized sequences provide the basis for the identification, classification, and functional annotation of candidate sequences in new genome and transcriptome assemblies.
Results: A pipeline for the automatic identification and functional annotation of MYBs in a given sequence data set was implemented in Python. MYB candidates are identified, screened for the presence of a MYB domain and other motifs, and finally placed in a phylogenetic context with well characterized sequences. In addition to technical benchmarking based on existing annotation, the transcriptome assembly of Croton tiglium and the annotated genome sequence of Castanea crenata were screened for MYBs. Results of both analyses are presented in this study to illustrate the potential of this application. The analysis of one species takes only a few minutes depending on the number of predicted sequences and the size of the MYB gene family. This pipeline, the required bait sequences, and reference sequences for a classification are freely available on github: https://github.com/bpucker/MYB_annotator.
Conclusions: This automatic annotation of the MYB gene family in novel assemblies makes genome-wide investigations consistent and paves the way for comparative studies in the future. Candidate genes for in-depth analyses are presented based on their orthology to previously characterized sequences which allows the functional annotation of the newly identified MYBs with high confidence. The identification of orthologs can also be harnessed to detect duplication and deletion events.</p>",2021-10-16

Maslon'}, {'name': 'Albert Jordan'}, {'name': 'Javier F.

In addition, it has been long proposed that histone H1 exerts context-specific effects on gene expression. Here, we have identified a new function of histone H1 in chromatin structure and transcription using a range of genomic approaches. We show that histone H1-depleted cells accumulate nascent non-coding RNAs on chromatin, suggesting that histone H1 prevents non-coding RNA transcription and regulates non-coding transcript turnover on chromatin. Accumulated non-coding transcripts have reduced levels of m6A modification and cause replication-transcription conflicts. Accordingly, altering the m6A RNA methylation pathway rescues the replicative phenotype of H1 loss. This work unveils unexpected regulatory roles of histone H1 on non-coding RNA turnover and m6A deposition, highlighting the intimate relationship between chromatin conformation, RNA metabolism and DNA replication to maintain genome performance.</p>",2021-10-12

Rono'}],"<p>The emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants may potentially have enhanced transmissibility and virulence of the virus, and impacts on performance of diagnostic tools and efficacy of vaccines. Genomic surveillance provides an opportunity to detect and characterize new mutations early enough for effective deployment of control strategies. Here, genomic data from Germany and United Kingdom were examined for genetic diversity by assessing gene mutations and inferring phylogeny. Delta variant sublineages were grouped into seven distinct clusters of spike mutations located in N-terminal domain of S1 region (T95I, D138H, *D142G, Y145H and A222V) and S2 region (T719I and *N950D). The most predominant cluster was T95I mutation, with the highest frequencies (71.1% - 83.9%) in Wales, England and Scotland, and the least frequencies (8.9% - 12.1%) in Germany. Two mutations, *D142G and *N950D here described as *reverse mutations and T719I mutation, were largely unique to Germany. In a month, frequencies of D142G had increased from 55.6% to 67.8 % in Germany. Additionally, a cluster of D142G+T719I/T mutation went up from 27.7% to 34.1%, while a T95I+ D142G+N950D/N cluster rose from 19.2% to 26.2%. Although, two distinct clusters of T95I+D138H (2.6% - 3.8%) and T95I+Y145H+A222V (2.5% - 8.5%) mutations were present in all the countries, they were most predominant in Wales and Scotland respectively. Results suggest divergent evolutionary trajectories between the clusters of D142G mutation and those of T95I mutation. These findings provide insights into underlying dynamics of evolution of the delta variant. Future studies may evaluate the epidemiological and biological implications of these sublineages.</p>",2021-10-12

Short-read polishing tools can use short reads to fix these errors, but most rely on short-read alignment which is unreliable in repeat regions. Errors in such regions are therefore challenging to fix and often remain after short-read polishing. Here we introduce Polypolish, a new short-read polisher which uses all-per-read alignments to repair errors in repeat sequences that other polishers cannot. In benchmarking tests using both simulated and real reads, we find that Polypolish performs well, and the best results are achieved by using Polypolish in combination with other short-read polishers.</p>",2021-10-16

Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling can coordinate tissue-level responses in developing and wounded epithelia in tissue explants and invertebrates[1, 2, 3, 4]. However, its role in the homeostatic, regenerative basal layer of the skin epithelium is unknown due to significant challenges in studying signaling dynamics in a spatially complex tissue context in live mice. Here we combine <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of dynamic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling at the single cell level across thousands of cells with a novel computational approach, Geometric Scattering Trajectory Homology (GSTH).

We discover local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling patterns are orchestrated so that signals flow in a coordinated and directed manner across the tissue, distinct from topographically uncoordinated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in excitatory tissues. Directed Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is regulated by the major gap junction protein in the epidermal stem cell layer, Connexin 43 (Cx43). Cx43 gap junctions are dissociated as cells progress through the cell cycle out of G1 and play an essential role in the progression of stem cells from G2 towards mitosis. Finally, G2 cells display related signaling patterns and are essential for tissue-level signaling coordination. Together, our results provide insight into how such a ubiquitous signaling pathway regulates highly specific behaviors and outcomes at a tissue-wide level to maintain proper homeostasis.</p>",2021-10-13

Cap’n’collar (CNC) transcription factors including Nuclear Factor Erythroid-2 Related Factor 1 (NFE2L1/NRF1) and NFE2L2 (NRF2) are important regulators of oxidative stress responses. Here, we report that NFE2L1 expression inhibits ferroptosis, independent of NFE2L2. NFE2L1 inhibits ferroptosis by promoting expression of the key anti-ferroptotic lipid hydroperoxidase glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). NFE2L1 abundance and function are regulated post-translationally by N-glycosylation. Functional maturation of NFE2L1 requires deglycosylation by cytosolic peptide:N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1). We find that loss of NGLY1 or NFE2L1 enhances ferroptosis sensitivity. Expression of wild-type NGLY1 but not a disease-associated NGLY1 mutant inhibits ferroptosis, and this effect is dependent on the presence of NFE2L1. Enhanced ferroptosis sensitivity in NFE2L1 and NFE2L2 knockout cells can be potently reverted by expression of an NFE2L1 mutant containing eight asparagine-to-aspartate protein sequence substitutions, which mimic NGLY1-catalyzed sequence editing. Enhanced ferroptosis sensitivity in NGLY1/NFE2L1 pathway mutants could also be reversed by overexpression of NFE2L2. These results suggest that ferroptosis sensitivity is regulated by NGLY1-catalyzed NFE2L1 deglycosylation, and highlight a broad role for CNC transcription factors in ferroptosis regulation.</p><sec><title>Significance Statement</title><p>Ferroptosis is an oxidative form of cell death whose biochemical regulation remains incompletely understood. NFE2L1/NRF1 is a cap’n’collar (CNC) transcription factor whose role in ferroptosis regulation is unclear. Unlike the CNC family member NFE2L2/NRF2, NFE2L1 is an N-glycoprotein whose abundance is regulated by post-translational deglycosylation catalyzed by the enzyme peptide:N-glycanase 1 (NGLY1). Our results indicate that NGLY1-mediated NFE2L1 deglycosylation, resulting in ‘editing’ of the NFE2L1 amino acid sequence, is necessary for NFE2L1 to inhibit ferroptosis. Mechanistically, NFE2L1 inhibits ferroptosis by via the anti-ferroptotic protein GPX4. This work demonstrates that CNC transcription factors beyond NFE2L2 can regulate ferroptosis. This work may suggest a role of misregulation of ferroptosis in NGLY1 deficiency, an ultrarare genetic disorder.</p></sec>",2021-10-12

In order to account for low counts in single-cell data, our method uses a Generalized Fused Lasso with Binomial likelihood for partitioning groups of cells by AI signal, and a hierarchical Bayesian model for AI statistical inference. In simulation, airpart accurately detected partitions of cell types by their AI and had lower RMSE of allelic ratio estimates than existing methods.

This cell to cell communication promotes GB expansion and neurodegeneration. Moreover, healthy neurons form glutamatergic functional synapses with GB cells which facilitate GB expansion and premature death in mouse GB xerograph models. Targeting signaling and synaptic components of GB progression may become a suitable strategy against glioblastoma. In a Drosophila GB model, we have determined the post-synaptic nature of GB cells with respect to neurons, and the contribution of post-synaptic genes expressed in GB cells to tumor progression.

Recent work in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> demonstrated that the mobile nucleoporin Nup2 is required for normal progression through meiosis I prophase and sporulation in strains where telomere-led chromosome movement has been compromised. The meiotic autonomous region (MAR), a short fragment of Nup2 responsible for its role in meiosis, was shown to localize to the nuclear envelope via Nup60 and to bind to meiotic chromosomes. To understand the relative contribution these two activities have on MAR function, we first carried out a screen for MAR mutants defective in sporulation and found that all the mutations disrupt interaction with both Nup60 and meiotic chromosomes. Moreover, <italic>nup60</italic> mutants phenocopy <italic>nup2</italic> mutants, exhibiting similar nuclear division kinetics, sporulation efficiencies, and genetic interactions with mutations that affect the telomere bouquet. Although full-length Nup60 requires Nup2 for function, removal of Nup60’s C-terminus allows Nup60 to bind meiotic chromosomes and promote sporulation without Nup2. In contrast, binding of the MAR to meiotic chromosomes is completely dependent on Nup60. Our findings uncover an inhibitory function for the Nup60 C-terminus and suggest that Nup60 mediates recruitment of meiotic chromosomes to the nuclear envelope, while Nup2 plays a secondary role counteracting Nup60’s autoinhibition.</p>",2021-10-13

At first, we determined the fMRI signatures of burst-suppression in human EEG-fMRI data. Applying this method to animal fMRI datasets, we found distinct burst-suppression signatures in all species. The burst-suppression maps revealed a marked inter-species difference: in rats the entire neocortex engaged in burst-suppression, while in primates most sensory areas were excluded—predominantly the primary visual cortex.

During this process, the RALF1-FER pathway upregulates CAR protein synthesis, which then controls the membrane lipid order. This might act as a rapid feedforward loop to stabilize FER in PM nanodomains. FER then interacts with and phosphorylates CARs, reducing their lipid-binding ability, which might break the feedback regulation and downregulate CAR activity at latter time point. Similar to fer mutant, a pentuple car14569 mutant inhibits flg22-induced FLS2-BAK1 complex formation, which ultimately impacts plant immunity.

RIG-I agonists elicit a strong immune activation in both tumor and immune cells and induce both direct and indirect immune cell-mediated tumor cell death which involves tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cell response and type I interferon-driven innate cytotoxic immunity. Besides RIG-I, irradiation is known to induce cytotoxic DNA damage resulting in tumor debulking followed by the induction of tumor-specific immunity. To date, it is unclear whether the molecular antitumor effects of RIG-I and irradiation are additive or even synergize. Here, we investigated the combination of RIG-I activation with radiotherapy in melanoma. We found that low dose x-ray irradiation enhanced the extent and immunogenicity of RIG-I mediated tumor cell death in human and murine melanoma cell lines and in the murine B16 melanoma model in vivo. Pathway analysis of transcriptomic data revealed a central role for p53 downstream of the combined treatment, which was corroborated using p53-/- B16 cells. In vivo, the additional effect of irradiation on immune cell activation and inhibition of tumor growth was lost in mice carrying p53-knockout B16 tumors, while the response to RIG-I stimulation in those mice was maintained. Thus, our results identify p53 as pivotal for the synergy of RIG-I with irradiation, resulting in potent induction of immunogenic tumor cell death. Consequently, low dose radiotherapy holds great promise to further improve the efficacy or RIG-I ligands especially in patients with malignant melanoma or other tumors exhibiting a functional p53 pathway.</p>",2021-10-16

Using Cre-directed optogenetics and in vivo neurophysiology in anesthetized mice of both sexes, here we studied whether TRPV1-lineage nociceptive and thermosensory fibers are primary neurons that drive trigeminal circuits reaching parabrachial taste cells. We monitored spiking activity in individual parabrachial neurons during photoexcitation of the terminals of TRPV1-lineage fibers that arrived at the dorsal spinal trigeminal nucleus pars caudalis, which relays orofacial somatosensory messages to the parabrachial area. Parabrachial neural responses to oral delivery of taste, chemesthetic, and thermal stimuli were also recorded. We found that optical excitation of TRPV1-lineage fibers frequently stimulated traditionally defined taste neurons in lateral parabrachial nuclei. The tuning of neurons across diverse tastes associated with their sensitivity to excitation of TRPV1-lineage fibers, which only sparingly engaged neurons oriented to preferred tastes like sucrose. Moreover, neurons that responded to photostimulation of TRPV1-lineage afferents showed strong responses to temperature including noxious heat, which predominantly excited parabrachial bitter taste cells. Multivariate analyses revealed the parabrachial confluence of TRPV1-lineage signals with taste captured sensory valence information shared across aversive gustatory, nociceptive, and thermal stimuli.

It typically features rapid breeding cycles that can lead to high rates of genetic gain. In recurrent phenotypic selection, generations do not overlap, which means that breeding candidates are evaluated and considered for selection for only one cycle. With recurrent genomic selection, candidates can be evaluated based on genomic estimated breeding values indefinitely, therefore facilitating overlapping generations. Candidates with true high breeding values that were discarded in one cycle due to underestimation of breeding value could be identified and selected in subsequent cycles. The consequences of allowing generations to overlap in recurrent selection are unknown. We assessed whether maintaining overlapping and discrete generations led to differences in genetic gain for phenotypic, genomic truncation, and genomic optimum contribution recurrent selection by simulation of traits with various heritabilities and genetic architectures across fifty breeding cycles. We also assessed differences of overlapping and discrete generations in a conventional breeding scheme with multiple stages and cohorts.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>With phenotypic selection, overlapping generations led to decreased genetic gain compared to discrete generations due to increased selection error bias. Selected individuals, which were in the upper tail of the distribution of phenotypic values, tended to also have high absolute error relative to their true breeding value compared to the overall population. Without repeated phenotyping, these individuals erroneously believed to have high value were repeatedly selected across cycles, leading to decreased genetic gain. With genomic truncation selection, overlapping and discrete generations performed similarly as updating breeding values precluded repeatedly selecting individuals with inaccurately high estimates of breeding values in subsequent cycles. Overlapping generations did not outperform discrete generations in the presence of a positive genetic trend with genomic truncation selection, as past generations had lower mean genetic values than the current generation of selection candidates. With genomic optimum contribution selection, overlapping and discrete generations performed similarly, but overlapping generations slightly outperformed discrete generations in the long term if the targeted inbreeding rate was extremely low.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Maintaining discrete generations in recurrent phenotypic selection leads to increased genetic gain, especially at low heritabilities, by preventing selection error bias. With genomic truncation selection and genomic optimum contribution selection, genetic gain does not differ between discrete and overlapping generations assuming non-genetic effects are not present. Overlapping generations may increase genetic gain in the long term with very low targeted rates of inbreeding in genomic optimum contribution selection.</p></sec>",2021-10-14

Cohesin-mediated chromosome loops regulate transcription by shaping long-range enhancer-promoter interactions, among other mechanisms. Mutations of cohesin subunits and regulators cause human developmental diseases termed cohesinopathy. Vertebrate cohesin consists of SMC1, SMC3, RAD21, and either STAG1 or STAG2. To probe the physiological functions of cohesin, we created conditional knockout (cKO) mice with <italic>Stag2</italic> deleted in the nervous system. <italic>Stag2</italic> cKO mice exhibit growth retardation, neurological defects, and premature death, in part due to insufficient myelination of nerve fibers. <italic>Stag2</italic> cKO oligodendrocytes exhibit delayed maturation and downregulation of myelination-related genes. <italic>Stag2</italic> loss reduces promoter-anchored loops at downregulated genes in oligodendrocytes. Thus, STAG2-cohesin generates promoter-anchored loops at myelination-promoting genes to facilitate their transcription. Our study implicates defective myelination as a contributing factor to cohesinopathy and establishes oligodendrocytes as a relevant cell type to explore the mechanisms by which cohesin regulates transcription.</p>",2021-10-12

We use a neutral stochastic model to examine the demographic patterns that emerge over time, across a range of population sizes and empirically observed mortality rates. A small proportion of trees (~1% at 1.5% mortality) are life-history lottery winners, achieving ages &gt;10-20x median age. Maximum age increases with bigger populations and lower mortality rates. One quarter of trees (~24%) achieve ages that are 3-4 times greater than median age. Three age classes (Mature, Old, and Ancient) contribute unique historical diversity across complex environmental cycles. Ancient trees are an emergent property of forests that requires many centuries to generate. They radically change generation time variance and population fitness, bridging infrequent environmental cycles. These life-history lottery winners are vital to future forest dynamics and invaluable data about environmental history and individual longevity. Old-growth forests contain trees that cannot be replaced through restoration or regeneration in the near future. They simply must be protected to preserve their unique diversity.</p>",2021-10-17

Coix lachrymal jobi, commonly known as Jobs tears or adlay has been reported to possess anti-cancer properties. Despite evidences provided by clinical data, the usage of Coix lacryma-jobi in treating cancer, particularly breast cancer, has been scarce. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the pharmacological mechanisms underlying its anti-breast cancer property using various network pathway analyses. Bioactive compounds from Coix lacryma-jobi and its potential target genes were obtained from SymMap. Breast cancer-related target genes were collected from CTD. Protein-protein interaction network was analyzed using the STRING database. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed using DAVID to further explore the mechanisms of Coix lacryma-jobi in treating breast cancer. PPI and compound-target-pathway were visualized using Cytoscape. A total of 26 bioactive compounds, 201 corresponding targets, 36625 breast cancer-associated targets were obtained, and 200 common targets were considered potential therapeutic targets. The 9 bioactive compounds identified were berberine, oleic acid, beta-sitosterol, sitosterol, linoleic acid, berberrubine, jatrorrhizine, thalifendine, and stigmasterol. The identified 5 core targets were ESR1, JUN, MAPK14, and RXRA.  Coix lacryma-jobi targets enriched in GO terms were mostly involved in regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, drug response, steroid hormone receptor activity, and protein binding. This study elucidates on the pharmacological underpinnings on the potency of adlay against breast cancer.  Its subsequent drug development will be worth a step forward for a breast cancer-free society.</p>",2021-10-16

Most of these candidate marker genes were found associated with the Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and Abscisic acid (ABA) axes. These ROS and ABA pathways were further supported by RNA-seq transcriptome data of FHB resistant cv. AAC Tenacious, a parent of the third bi-parental population.

Most prokaryotic Argonaute proteins (pAgos) use 5’P-gDNA to target complementary DNA. However, more and more studies on the properties of pAgos make their functions more diversified. Previously reported pAgos only possess several forms of high activity in all eight cleavage patterns, which limits their practical applications. Here, we described a unique pAgo from <italic>Marinitoga hydrogenitolerans</italic> (MhAgo) with eight cleavage activities. MhAgo can utilize all four types of guides (5’OH-gDNA, 5’P-gDNA, 5’OH-gRNA, and 5’P-gRNA) for ssDNA and RNA cleavage. Further studies demonstrated that MhAgo had high activities with 16-21 nt guides and no obvious preferences for the 5’-end nucleotides of 5’OH-guides. Unexpectedly, MhAgo had different preferences for the 5’-end nucleotides of 5’P-guides depending on the types of targets. Although the specificity of MhAgo was related to the types of guides, single mismatches in the central and 3’-supplementary regions of guides greatly reduced the cleavage efficiency. Additionally, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated MhAgo had the weakest affinity for 5’P-gRNA:tRNA duplex, which was consistent with its cleavage efficiency. In conclusion, MhAgo is highly active under a wide range of conditions and can be used for programmable endonucleolytic cleavage of both ssDNA and RNA substrates. The abundant biochemical characteristics of MhAgo broaden our understanding of pAgos and expand the potential application in nucleic acids manipulations.</p>",2021-10-12

Indeed, a role for bioelectricity has been well established at the organismal level. While the importance of electrostatics in protein functions such as protein-protein association and enzymatic activity has been well documented, very little is known on how biomolecules respond to external electric fields, or in other words, what may be the potential contribution of polarizability to protein function. Here we use phototriggered charge injection from a site-specifically attached ruthenium photosensitizer to directly demonstrate the effects of charge redistribution within a protein. We find that binding of an antibody to phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is increased two folds under illumination. Remarkably, illumination is found to suppress the enzymatic activity of PGK by a factor as large as three. These responses are sensitive to the photosensitizer position on the protein. Surprisingly, left (but not right) circularly polarized light elicits these responses, indicating that the electrons involved in the observed dynamics are spin polarized, due to spin filtration by protein chiral structures. Our results directly establish the contribution of electrical polarization and the importance of the spin-dependent charge reorganization in the function of proteins. Future experiments with phototriggered charge injection will allow delineation of charge rearrangement pathways within proteins and will further depict their effects on protein function.</p>",2021-10-13

In this study, we investigated the impact of pancreatic cancer ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) derived EVs on recipient non-tumorigenic pancreatic normal epithelial cells upon internalization. We show that PDAC cEVs increase the proliferation and invasive capability of treated normal cells. We further demonstrate that cEVs induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in treated normal pancreatic epithelial cells within 24 hours. Subsequently, these cells release several inflammatory cytokines. Leveraging a layered multi-omics approach, we analyzed EV cargo from a panel of 6 PDAC and 2 normal pancreas cell lines, using multiple EV isolation methods. We found that cEVs were enriched for an array of biomolecules which can induce or regulate ER stress and the UPR, including palmitic acid, sphingomyelins, metabolic regulators of tRNA charging and proteins which regulate trafficking and degradation. We further show that palmitic acid, at doses relevant to those found in cEVs, is sufficient to induce ER stress in normal pancreas cells. These results suggest that cEV cargo packaging may be designed to disseminate proliferative and invasive characteristics upon internalization by distant recipient normal cells, hitherto unreported. This study is among the first to highlight a major role for PDAC cEVs to induce stress in treated normal pancreas cells that may modulate a systemic response leading to altered phenotypes. For the first time, our study implicates cEV transported palmitic acid as a potential driver in this process.

Starch hydrolysis is catalyzed by members of the β-amylase (BAM) family, which in Arabidopsis thaliana (At), includes nine structurally and functionally diverse members. One of these enzymes, AtBAM2, is a plastid-localized enzyme that is unique among characterized β-amylases since it is tetrameric and exhibits sigmoidal kinetics. Sequence alignments show that the BAM domains of AtBAM7, a catalytically inactive, nuclear-localized transcription factor with an N-terminal DNA binding domain, and AtBAM2 are more closely related to each other than they are to any other AtBAM. Since BAM2 is found in more ancient lineages, it was hypothesized that BAM7 evolved from BAM2. However, analysis of the genomes of 48 flowering plants revealed 12 species that appear to have a BAM7 gene but lack a BAM2 gene. Upon closer inspection, these BAM7 proteins have a greater percent identity to AtBAM2 than to AtBAM7, and they share all of the AtBAM2 functional residues that BAM7 proteins normally lack. We hypothesize that these genes may encode a BAM2-like protein although they are currently annotated as BAM7-like genes. To test this hypothesis, we designed a cDNA of the short form of corn BAM7 (ZmBAM7-S) for expression in E. coli. Small Angle X-Ray Scattering data indicate that ZmBAM7-S has a tetrameric solution structure more similar to that of AtBAM2 than AtBAM1. In addition, partially purified ZmBAM7-S is catalytically active and exhibits sigmoidal kinetics. Together these data suggest that some BAM7 genes may encode a functional BAM2.

They comprise of various characteristics such as diploid genetics, small genome size, rapid growth cycle, and relatively low repetitive DNA content, making it a perfect model for plant genome projects. Objective: The aim of this present Insilico research study is to carry out molecular drug docking studies between PERK13  Proline rich receptor like protein kinase and De O Acetylated Curcumin Di Galactose or digalactosylated curcumin, a derivative of curcumin. PERK13 protein is considered to play a significant role in helping plants tackle salinity levels in water. Methods: In this study, protein modelling tools and servers are used to model the 3D structure and the same is validated using Protein structure validation tools. Automated drug docking servers were used to dock the modelled protein with the chemical compound to analyse the electrostatic (H bond) interaction between PERK13 and De O Acetylated Curcumin Di Galactose, a better water soluble compound than curcumin. The docked structure was visualized using an advanced molecular visualization tool. Results and Discussion: The overall results obtained from this study on De O Acetylated Curcumin Di Galactose and PERK13 protein shows that De O Acetylated Curcumin Di Galactose, directly binds with the active site and other potentially binding regions of PERK13. Hence, it is concluded that De O Acetylated Curcumin Di Galactose could potentially play a vital role in future research related to the problem of helping the plants tackle increased saline levels in water.
