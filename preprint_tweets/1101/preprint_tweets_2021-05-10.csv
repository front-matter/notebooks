In this study, we hypothesized that COVID-19 vaccines may elicit production of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the upper respiratory tract, such as in oral and nasal mucosal fluid. To test that hypothesis, we enrolled 114 participants within 3-7 days of receiving the first dose of the Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and collected oral mucosal fluid samples on days 5, 10, 15, and 20 after each vaccine dose. Of participants naive to SARS-CoV-2 (n = 89), 79 (85.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by time point 2 (10 days +/-2 days after first vaccine dose), and 100% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG by time point 3 (15 days +/- 2 days after first vaccine dose). Additionally, we collected paired oral mucosal fluid and anterior nares samples from 10 participants who had received both vaccine doses. We found that participants had an average SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody concentration of 2496.0 +/- 2698.0ng/mL in nasal mucosal fluid versus 153.4 +/- 141.0ng/mL in oral mucosal fluid. Here, we demonstrate detection and longitudinal persistence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in upper respiratory tract specimens following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. A high concentration of IgG targeting viral spike protein in the upper respiratory system may play an unexplored role in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and deserves further investigation.</p>",2021-05-07

Here, we describe a functional CRISPR/Cas9 screen aiming at identifying SARS-CoV-2 restriction factors. We identified DAXX, a scaffold protein residing in PML nuclear bodies known to limit the replication of DNA viruses and retroviruses, as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. Basal expression of DAXX was sufficient to limit the replication of the virus, and DAXX over-expression further restricted infection. In contrast with most of its previously described antiviral activities, DAXX-mediated restriction of SARS-CoV-2 was independent of the SUMOylation pathway. SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered the re-localization of DAXX to cytoplasmic sites of viral replication and led to its degradation. Together, these results demonstrate that DAXX is a potent restriction factor for SARS-CoV-2 and that the virus has evolved a mechanism to counteract its action.</p>",2021-05-06

Both of these inputs are detected by the lateral line, a collection of mechanosensory organs distributed along the surface of the body.</p><p>In this study, we characterize in detail how the hair cells, which are the receptor cells of the lateral line, discriminate between such reafferent and exafferent signals in zebrafish larvae. Using dye labeling of the lateral line nerve, we visualize two parallel descending inputs that can influence lateral line sensitivity. We combine functional imaging with ultra-structural EM circuit reconstruction to show that cholinergic signals originating from the hindbrain transmit efference copies that cancel out self-generated reafferent stimulation during locomotion, and that dopaminergic signals from the hypothalamus may have a role in threshold modulation both in response to locomotion and salient stimuli.

We identified MYB16, a key transcription factor controlling cutin biosynthesis, from previous stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC)-enriched transcriptome study. The preferential localization of MYB16 in SLGCs but not meristemoids suggests a link between cutin synthesis and stomatal development. Here, we showed that downregulation of MYB16 in meristemoids was directly mediated by the stomatal master transcription factor, SPEECHLESS (SPCH). The suppression of MYB16 before asymmetric division was crucial for stomatal patterning because overexpression or ectopic expression of MYB16 in meristemoids increased impermeability and elevated stomatal density and clusters. The aberrant pattern of stomata was due to reduced and disrupted establishment of polarity during asymmetric cell division. Manipulating polarity by growing seedlings on hard agar rescued stomatal clusters and polarity defects in MYB16 ectopic lines. By expressing a cutinase in MYB16 ectopic lines, stomatal clustering was reduced, which suggests that the ectopic accumulation of cuticle affects the polarity in asymmetrically dividing cells and causes clustered stomata. Taken together, inhibiting MYB16 expression by SPCH in early stomatal lineage is required to correctly place the polarity complex for proper stomatal patterning during leaf morphogenesis.</p>",2021-05-03

Neurons of the basal forebrain nucleus basalis and substantia innominata (NBM/SI<sub>p</sub>) comprise the major source of cholinergic input to the basolateral amygdala (BLA), whose activation are required for both the acquisition and retrieval of cued threat memory and innate threat response behavior. The retrieval of threat memory by the presentation of the conditioning tone alone elicits acetylcholine (ACh) release in the BLA and the BLA-projecting cholinergic neurons manifest immediate early gene responses and display increased intrinsic excitability for 2-5 hours following the cue-elicited memory response to the conditioned stimulus. Silencing cue-associated engram-enrolled cholinergic neurons prevents the expression of the defensive response and the subset of cholinergic neurons activated by cue is distinct from those engaged by innate threat.

Leche'}, {'name': 'Anatoly Kiyatkin'}, {'name': 'Steven E. Stayrook'}, {'name': 'Kathryn M. Ferguson'}, {'name': 'Mark A. Lemmon'}]","<p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently mutated in human cancer, and is an important therapeutic target. EGFR inhibitors have been successful in lung cancer, where the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain is mutated, but not in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) – where mutations (or deletions) occur exclusively in the EGFR extracellular region. Wild-type EGFR is known to elicit distinct signals in response to different growth factor ligands, exhibiting biased agonism. We recently showed that individual ligands stabilize distinct receptor dimer structures, which signal with different kinetics to specify outcome. EGF induces strong symmetric dimers that signal transiently to promote proliferation. Epiregulin (EREG) induces weak asymmetric dimers that generate sustained signaling and differentiation. Intriguingly, several GBM mutation hotspots coincide with residues that define the asymmetric and symmetric dimer structures. Here, we show that common extracellular GBM mutations prevent EGFR from distinguishing between EGF and EREG based on dimer structure and stability – allowing strong dimers to form with both ligands. Crystal structures show that the R84K mutation symmetrizes EREG-driven dimers, whereas the A265V mutation remodels key dimerization sites. Our results suggest that modulating EGFR’s biased agonism plays an important role in GBM, and suggest new approaches for ‘correcting’ aberrant EGFR signaling in cancer.</p>",2021-05-04

Interactions between clients and care workers are modelled using specially generated networks, with network parameters reflecting realistic patterns of care needs and visit allocation. These networks are then used to simulate and SEIR-type epidemic dynamics with different numbers of infectious and recovery stages. The results indicate that with the same overall capacity provided by care workers, the minimum peak proportion of infection, and the smallest overall size of infection are achieved for the highest proportion of overlap between visit allocation, i.e. when care workers have the highest chances of being allocated a visit to the same client they have visited before. An intuitive explanation of this is that while providing the required care coverage, maximising overlap in visit allocation reduces the possibility of an infectious care worker inadvertently spreading the infection to other clients. The model is quite generic and can be adapted to any particular directly transmitted infectious disease, such as, more recently, COVID-19, provided accurate estimates of disease parameters can be obtained from real data.</p>",2021-05-07

In contrast, low dose of SARS-CoV-2 via fomites did not result in productive infection in the majority of exposed hamsters and these animals remained non-seroconverted. After recovery, hamsters were re-exposed to hCoV-19/South African/KRISP-K005325/2020 (VOC B.1.351) via an intranasal challenge. Seroconverted rechallenged animals did not lose weight and shed virus for 3 days. They had little infectious virus and no pathology in the lungs. In contrast, shedding, weight loss and extensive pulmonary pathology caused by B.1.351 replication was observed in the non-seroconverted animals. The rechallenged seroconverted animals did not transmit virus to naïve sentinels via direct contact transmission, in contrast to the non-seroconverted animals. Reinfection with B.1.351 triggered an anamnestic response that boosted not only neutralizing titers against lineage A, but also titers against B.1.351.

Integration of these associations with clinical data from 3.01 million patients showed that age-related diseases associated with each of five aging mechanisms were more likely than chance to be present together in patients. Genetic evidence revealed that innate and adaptive immunity, the intrinsic apoptotic signalling pathway and activity of the ERK1/2 pathway played a significant role across multiple aging mechanisms and multiple, diverse age-related diseases.

Over the last 45-years, phosphorus sorption has declined with suspended sediment exports due to increases in soil-erosion-minimizing agricultural practices, likely contributing to recent cyanobacterial blooms. In this, and likely other agricultural watersheds, rivers perform an unrecognized ecosystem service during high flow creating field-river-lake linkages that need to be incorporated into phosphorus management.</p>",2021-05-03

Early transmission models focused on surface contamination, but current research provides evidence for person-to-person transmission via aerosolized viral particles. As such, the CDC’s guidance has recently been updated to increasingly redirect the focus of prevention methods to aerosol routes. Inhalation of SARS-CoV-2 particles presents the most significant threat of infection to individuals. A secondary route, from hand to mouth, eyes or nose, is likely after contact with a surface contaminated with particles that have settled out of aerosols or been deposited by contaminated hands. Using common molecular detection methods including endpoint and quantitative PCR, we investigated whether there is detectable contamination by SARS-CoV-2 on high-touch surfaces on public transit vehicles and on other high-touch surfaces on a college campus during normal use. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can be successfully recovered and detected on common high-touch surfaces, albeit in comparatively lower frequencies as public health guidance progressed and more rigorous sanitization procedures were implemented.</p><sec><title>Abstract Figure</title><fig id=""ufig1"" position=""float"" fig-type=""figure"" orientation=""portrait""><graphic xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""21256107v1_ufig1"" position=""float"" orientation=""portrait"" /></fig><p><bold>Graphical abstract created with permission from <ext-link xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" ext-link-type=""uri"" xlink:href=""http://BioRender.com"">BioRender.com</ext-link> (2021)</bold>.</p></sec>",2021-05-04

Recent studies indicate that the composition and molecular organization of phase-separated organelles such as Stress Granules (SGs) and Processing Bodies (PBs) are highly variable and dynamic. A dense contact network involving both RNAs and proteins controls the formation of SGs and PBs and an intricate molecular architecture, at present poorly understood, guarantees that these assemblies sense and adapt to different stresses and environmental changes. Here, we investigated the physico-chemical properties of SGs and PBs components and studied the architecture of their interaction networks. We observed that proteins and RNAs establishing the largest amount of contacts have distinct structural characteristics. More specifically, we found that structural disorder is enriched in all protein-RNA, protein-protein and RNA-RNA interactions. Intriguingly, enrichment in the disorder of proteins is linked to increased number of interactions with single-stranded regions in RNAs. Our findings support the hypothesis that SGs and PBs can quickly assemble and disassemble thanks to the activity of unfolded domains in proteins and single-stranded regions in RNAs, guaranteeing the formation of dynamic contacts.</p>",2021-05-05

Here, we investigate four independent models of intergenerational adaptations to stress in C. elegans (bacterial infection, eukaryotic infection, osmotic stress and nutrient stress) across multiple species. We found that all four intergenerational physiological adaptations are conserved in at least one other species, that they are stress-specific, and that they have deleterious trade-offs in mismatched environments. By profiling the effects of parental bacterial infection and osmotic stress exposure on progeny gene expression across species we established a core set of 279 highly conserved genes that exhibited intergenerational changes in expression in response to stress in all species tested and provide evidence suggesting that presumed adaptive and deleterious intergenerational effects are molecularly related at the gene expression level. By contrast, we found that these same stresses did not elicit any similarly conserved transgenerational changes in progeny gene expression three generations after stress exposure. We conclude that intergenerational responses to stress play a substantial and evolutionarily conserved role in regulating animal physiology and that the vast majority of the effects of parental stress on progeny gene expression are reversible and not maintained transgenerationally.</p>",2021-05-08

Here, we report that a defining feature distinguishing the two pluripotent states lies in the ability of naive but not primed cells to erase occlusion. This “deocclusion” capacity requires Esrrb, a gene expressed only in the naive but not primed state. Notably, Esrrb silencing in the primed state is itself due to occlusion. Collectively, our data argue that the Esrrb-dependent deocclusion capacity in naive cells is key for sustaining naive pluripotency, and the loss of this capacity in the primed state via the occlusion of Esrrb poises cells for differentiation.</p>",2021-05-04

Using an animal model of chronic stress, we assessed the impact of variable durations of chronic stress on the emergence of behavioral deficits and associated molecular changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), brain region highly sensitive to stress and impaired in depression. Mice were exposed to up to 35 days of chronic restraint stress and were assessed weekly on behavioral tests measuring anxiety and anhedonia. PFC Protein and RNA levels of specific markers of excitatory, inhibitory synapses and astroglia were quantified using western blot and qPCR, respectively. Correlation and integrative network analyses were used to investigated the impact of chronic stress on the different compartments. Results showed that chronic stress induces anxiety-like behaviors within 7 days, while anhedonia-like behaviors were observed only after 35 days. At the molecular level, alterations of many markers were observed, in particular with longer exposure to chronic stress. Finally, correlation analyses and integrative network analyses revealed that male and female mice react differently to chronic stress exposure and that some markers seem to be more correlated to behaviors deficits in males than in females.

On January 4, 2021, the P.1 SARS-CoV-2 genetic variant was firstly identified in the country and recent data has indicated an association with higher hospitalization rates and mortality. The impact of P.1 variant in the obstetric population remains unclear.
Methods: We carried out a preliminary analysis of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 confirmed maternal deaths (between 10-50 years old) comparing cases reported to the Brazilian official severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) surveillance system (SS) in 2020 with those from 2021 (until April 12, 2021). This preliminary analysis employed methods described in previous reports from our group.
Results: 803 maternal deaths out of 8,248 COVID-19 maternal SARS cases with a recorded outcome were reported to the SARS-SS since March 2020. Case fatality rate was significantly higher in 2021 (15.6% vs 7.4%). The first three months of 2021 already account for 46.2% of all deaths occurred in the 13-months analysed period. COVID-19 fatal cases from 2021 had a lower proportion of at least one risk factor or comorbidity as compared to 2020 but had a higher frequency of obesity. There were no significant differences in terms of age, type of residence area (urban, rural, or peri-urban), type of funding of the notification unit (public vs. private), COVID-19 diagnostic criteria, pregnancy status (pregnancy or postpartum), cardiovascular disease or diabetes. The proportion of hospitalization, ICU admission, and respiratory support before death was also not significantly different. 
Conclusion: Case fatality rate was increased in the three first months of 2021 when compared to 2020. Once variables related to health care access and demographics are not significantly different and women seem to be healthier in the 2021 sample, such difference may be related to the circulation of more aggressive genetic variants in the country.</p>",2021-05-08

We find that the rate of adaptive evolution is significantly positively correlated to the rate of recombination, protein length and gene expression level, and negatively correlated to gene age. The correlations remain significant when each factor is controlled for in turn, except when controlling for expression in an analysis of protein length; and they also remain significant, or marginally significant, when biased gene conversion is controlled for. However, the positive correlations could be an artefact of population size contraction. We also find that the rate of non-adaptive evolution is negatively correlated to each factor, and all these correlations survive controlling for each other and biased gene conversion. Finally, we examine the effect of gene function on rates of adaptive and non-adaptive evolution; we confirm that virus interacting proteins (VIPs) have higher rates of adaptive and lower rates of non-adaptive evolution, but we also demonstrate that there is significant variation in the rate of adaptive and non-adaptive evolution between GO categories when removing VIPs.

Failed (poor quality) queens sampled from a wide geographic range have higher levels of viral infection, smaller ovaries, and altered ovarian protein composition, with over 20% of proteins differentially expressed. Significantly reduced levels of the yolk-protein precursor vitellogenin in the ovaries indicate a direct decline in fertility. We experimentally infected queens with Israeli acute paralysis virus and, as expected, infected queens exhibited significantly lower vitellogenin expression and higher HSP expression, confirming a causal relationship between viral infection and genes involved in fertility and immunity.
