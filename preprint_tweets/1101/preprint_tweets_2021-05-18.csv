Clinical codes to describe this phenomenon were released in November 2020 in the UK, but it is not known how these codes have been used in practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Working on behalf of NHS England, we used OpenSAFELY data encompassing 96% of the English population. We measured the proportion of people with a recorded code for long COVID, overall and by demographic factors, electronic health record software system, and week. We also measured variation in recording amongst practices.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Long COVID was recorded for 23,273 people. Coding was unevenly distributed amongst practices, with 26.7% of practices having not used the codes at all. Regional variation was high, ranging between 20.3 per 100,000 people for East of England (95% confidence interval 19.3-21.4) and 55.6 in London (95% CI 54.1-57.1). The rate was higher amongst women (52.1, 95% CI 51.3-52.9) compared to men (28.1, 95% CI 27.5-28.7), and higher amongst practices using EMIS software (53.7, 95% CI 52.9-54.4) compared to TPP software (20.9, 95% CI 20.3-21.4).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Long COVID coding in primary care is low compared with early reports of long COVID prevalence. This may reflect under-coding, sub-optimal communication of clinical terms, under-diagnosis, a true low prevalence of long COVID diagnosed by clinicians, or a combination of factors. We recommend increased awareness of diagnostic codes, to facilitate research and planning of services; and surveys of clinicians’ experiences, to complement ongoing patient surveys.</p></sec>",2021-05-13

Here, we describe the genomic epidemiology using a dataset of 8746 genomes from 33 African countries and two overseas territories. We show that the epidemics in most countries were initiated by importations, predominantly from Europe, which diminished following the early introduction of international travel restrictions. As the pandemic progressed, ongoing transmission in many countries and increasing mobility led to the emergence and spread within the continent of many variants of concern and interest, such as B.1.351, B.1.525, A.23.1 and C.1.1. Although distorted by low sampling numbers and blind-spots, the findings highlight that Africa must not be left behind in the global pandemic response, otherwise it could become a breeding ground for new variants.</p>",2021-05-13

Numerous brain parcellations have been proposed, using cytoarchitectonic data, structural or functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The intrinsic smoothness of the brain data, however, poses a problem for current methods seeking to compare different parcellations to each other. For example, criteria that simply compare within-parcel to between-parcel similarity provide even random parcellations with a high value. Furthermore, the evaluation is biased by the spatial scale of the parcellation. To address this problem, we propose the Distance Controlled Boundary Coefficient (DCBC), an unbiased criterion to evaluate discrete parcellations. We employ this new criterion to evaluate whether existing parcellations of the human neocortex can predict functional boundaries on a rich multi-domain task battery. We find that common anatomical parcellations do not perform better than chance, suggesting that task-based functional boundaries do not align well with sulcal landmarks. Parcellations based on resting-state fMRI data perform well; in some cases, as well as a parcellation defined on the evaluation data itself. Finally, multi-modal parcellations that combine functional and anatomical criteria perform substantially worse than those based on functional data alone, indicating that functionally homogeneous regions often span major anatomical landmarks. Overall, the DCBC advances the field of functional brain mapping by providing an unbiased metric that compares the predictive ability of different brain parcellations to define functionally and anatomically homogeneous brain regions.</p>",2021-05-11

Although strains with substantial fitness differences coexist within centimeter-scale regions, each pore is dominated by a single strain.

We therefore propose that pore anatomy imposes random single-cell bottlenecks during migration into pores and subsequently blocks new migrants; the resulting population fragmentation reduces competition and promotes coexistence. Our findings imply that therapeutic interventions involving pore-dwelling species should focus on removing resident populations over optimizing probiotic fitness.</p>",2021-05-14

Advances in spatial transcriptomics open the way for studying these important determinants of cellular function by enabling a transcriptome-wide evaluation of gene expression <italic>in situ</italic>. A critical limitation of the current technologies, however, is that their resolution is limited to niches (spots) of sizes well beyond that of a single cell, thus providing measurements for cell aggregates which may mask critical interactions between neighboring cells of different types. While joint analysis with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can be leveraged to alleviate this problem, current analyses are limited to a discrete view of cell type proportion inside every spot. This limitation becomes critical in the common case where, even within a cell type, there is a continuum of cell states that cannot be clearly demarcated but reflects important differences in the way cells function and interact with their surroundings. To address this, we developed Deconvolution of Spatial Transcriptomics profiles using Variational Inference (DestVI), a probabilistic method for multi-resolution analysis for spatial transcriptomics that explicitly models continuous variation within cell types. Using simulations, we demonstrate that DestVI is capable of providing higher resolution compared to the existing methods and that it can estimate gene expression by every cell type inside every spot. We then introduce an automated pipeline that uses DestVI for analysis of single tissue slices and comparison between tissues. We apply this pipeline to study the immune crosstalk within lymph nodes to infection and explore the spatial organization of a mouse tumor model. In both cases, we demonstrate that DestVI can provide a high resolution and accurate spatial characterization of the cellular organization of these tissues, and that it is capable of identifying important cell-type-specific changes in gene expression - between different tissue regions or between conditions.

The major impediment is that sample attributes such as tissue/cell-type of origin are routinely described using non-standard, varied terminologies written in unstructured natural language. Here, we propose a natural-language-processing-based machine learning approach (NLP-ML) to infer tissue and cell-type annotations for –omics samples based only on their free-text metadata. NLP-ML works by creating numerical representations of sample text descriptions and using these representations as features in a supervised learning classifier that predicts tissue/cell-type terms in a structured ontology. Our approach significantly and substantially outperforms an advanced text annotation method (MetaSRA) that uses graph-based reasoning and a baseline method (TAGGER) that annotates text based on exact string matching. Model similarities between related tissues demonstrate that NLP-ML models capture biologically-meaningful signals in text, as does the ability of these models to classify tissue-associated biological processes and diseases based on their descriptions alone. NLP-ML models are nearly as accurate as models based on gene-expression profiles in predicting sample tissue annotations but have the distinct capability to classify samples irrespective of the –omics experiment type based on their text metadata.

E1A competes with host factors to bind the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, triggering early S-phase entry and disrupting normal cellular proliferation. We show that the ability to outcompete host factors depends on the picomolar binding affinity of E1A for Rb, which is driven by two binding motifs tethered by a hypervariable disordered linker. Binding affinity is determined by the spatial dimensions of the linker, which constrain the relative position of the two binding motifs. Despite substantial sequence variation across evolution, the linker dimensions are finely optimized through compensatory changes in amino acid sequence and sequence length, leading to conserved linker dimensions and maximal affinity. We refer to the mechanism that conserves spatial dimensions despite large-scale variations in sequence as conformational buffering. Conformational buffering explains how variable disordered proteins encode functions and could be a general mechanism for functional selection within disordered protein regions.</p>",2021-05-16

In this paper, we shed light on the effectiveness of such a strategy in two European countries (Spain and Italy) by analysing data from June to December 2020, collected via a large-scale online citizen survey with 95,251 answers in Spain and 43,393 answers in Italy. Through our analysis, we identify several weaknesses in each of the three pillars of the TTI strategy: testing, tracing and isolating. Moreover, we analyse the respondents’ self-reported behaviour before and after the mitigation strategies were deployed during the second wave of infections. We find that the changes in the participants’ behaviour were more pronounced in Italy than in Spain, whereas in both countries, respondents reported being very compliant with individual protection measures, such as wearing facial masks or frequently disinfecting their hands. Finally, we analyse the participants’ perceptions about their government’s measures and the safety of everyday activities and places regarding the risk of getting an infection. We find that the perceived risk is often gender- and age-dependent and not aligned with the risk level identified by the literature. This finding emphasises the importance of deploying public-health communication campaigns to debunk misconceptions about SARS-CoV-2.

Low EtBr accumulation in stationary phase was not due to the upregulation of other efflux pumps, but instead, due to decreased permeability of the envelope in stationary phase. RNAseq identified changes in expression of several pathways that remodel the envelope in stationary phase, leading to lower permeability. This study shows that efflux is only important for maintaining low drug accumulation in actively growing cells, and that envelope permeability is the predominant factor dictating the rate of drug entry in stationary phase cells. This conclusion means that (i) antibiotics with intracellular targets may be less effective in complex non-growing or slow-growing bacterial infections where intracellular accumulation may be low, (ii) efflux inhibitors may be successful in potentiating the activity of existing antibiotics, but potentially only for bacterial infections where cells are actively growing and (iii) the remodelling of the cell envelope prior to stationary phase could provide novel drug targets.</p>",2021-05-11

Here, we show that NK-cell suppression of T cells is associated with a transient accumulation of NK cells within T cell-rich sites of the spleen during lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is required for relocation to T-cell zones and suppression of antiviral T cells. Accordingly, this NK-cell migration is mediated by type I interferon (IFN)-dependent promotion of CXCR3 ligand expression. In contrast, adenoviral vectors that weakly induce type I IFN and do not stimulate NK-cell inhibition of T cells also do not promote measurable redistribution of NK cells to T-cell zones. Provision of supplemental IFN could rescue NK-cell migration during adenoviral vector immunization. Thus, type I IFN and CXCR3 are critical for properly positioning NK cells to constrain antiviral T-cell responses.

Slave-maker ants are social parasites that exploit the work force of closely related ant species for social behaviours such as brood care and foraging. Recent divergence between these social parasites and their hosts enables comparative studies of gene family evolution. We sequenced the genomes of eight ant species, representing three independent origins of ant slavery. During the evolution of eusociality, chemoreceptor genes multiplied due to the importance of chemical communication in societies. We investigated evolutionary patterns of chemoreceptors in relation to slave-making in ants. We found that slave-maker ant genomes harboured only half as many gustatory receptors as their hosts, potentially mirroring the outsourcing of foraging tasks to host workers. In addition, parasites had fewer odorant receptors and their loss shows patterns of convergence across origins of parasitism, representing a rare case of convergent molecular evolution. This convergent loss of specific odorant receptors suggests that selective deprivation of receptors is adaptive. The 9-exon odorant receptor subfamily, previously linked to social evolution in insects, was significantly enriched for convergent loss across the three origins of slavery in our study, indicating that the transition to social parasitism in ants is accompanied by the loss of receptors that are likely important for mediating eusocial behaviour. Overall, gene loss in slave-maker ants suggests that a switch to a parasitic lifestyle accompanies relaxed selection on chemical perception.</p>",2021-05-11

Biochemical assays show that the RdRp readily uses the active form of molnupiravir, β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) triphosphate, as a substrate instead of CTP or UTP. Incorporation of NHC monophosphate into nascent RNA does not impair further RdRp progression. When the RdRp uses the resulting RNA as a template, NHC directs incorporation of either G or A, leading to mutated RNA products. Structural analysis of RdRp-RNA complexes containing mutagenesis products shows that NHC can form stable base pairs with either G or A in the RdRp active center, explaining how the polymerase escapes proofreading and synthesizes mutated RNA. This two-step mutagenesis mechanism likely applies to various viral polymerases and can explain the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of molnupiravir.</p>",2021-05-11

In maize, the presence of specialized aerial brace roots has been shown to increase anchorage and root lodging resistance. However, beyond scoring for presence, there have been limited attempts to define the brace root phenotypes that optimize anchorage. This study reports variable root lodging and plant biomechanics in a population of 52 maize inbred lines. To quantify the variation in brace root phenotypes within this population, a semi-automated phenotyping workflow was developed. These empirical measurements were integrated into predictive random forest models to demonstrate that brace root phenotypes can classify root lodging incidence and plant biomechanics. The prediction accuracy of these models is driven by multiple brace root phenotypes suggesting that anchorage can be optimized by the manipulation of multiple functional traits. Plant height has been previously associated with lodging susceptibility yet the inclusion of plant height as a predictor does not always improve prediction accuracy. Previously, brace root node number has been shown to be genetically linked to plant height and here we show that additional brace root phenotypes are linked to plant height but with opposing effects on root lodging susceptibility.

This study brings together data from six European countries to estimate the background incidence of TTS. We used six large databases of routinely-collected data allowing for sufficient sample size to study TTS across multiple study populations and in different age and sex strata.

Expected events would however be higher for an older cohort, as patients with TTS are typically older than the general population. Patients with TTS are more often men and appear to typically have more comorbidities and greater medication use, including prior use of antithrombotic and anticoagulant therapies, than the general population.</p><p>Not only do the rates of TTS being reported among those who had received an adenovirus-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 raise a concern, but early evidence from spontaneous reports suggests that TTS among those vaccinated has been more commonly been seen among women and younger persons. While this might be in part explained by potential biases in spontaneous reporting, it also underlines the importance of further evaluation of the safety signal for TTS.</p><p>As with other adverse events of special interest for COVID-19 vaccines, estimates of TTS vary depending on the data source used. Comparison of observed versus expected TTS rates during the monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines should ideally be done using the same databases for the estimation of post-vaccine (observed) and background (expected) rates, with adjustment for patient characteristics (such as age and sex) done as part of the analysis.</p></sec></sec>",2021-05-13

Runx1 resides in a 1.1 Mb topologically associating domain (TAD) demarcated by convergent CTCF motifs. As ESCs differentiate to mesoderm, chromatin accessibility, Runx1 enhancer-promoter (E-P) interactions, and CTCF-CTCF interactions increased in the TAD, along with initiation of Runx1 expression from the P2 promoter. Differentiation to hematopoietic progenitor cells was associated with the formation of tissue-specific sub-TADs over Runx1, a shift in E-P interactions, P1 promoter demethylation, and robust expression from both Runx1 promoters. Deletions of promoter-proximal CTCF sites at the sub-TAD boundaries had no obvious effects on E-P interactions but led to partial loss of domain structure, mildly affected gene expression, and delayed hematopoietic development.

When applied to simulation data, this type of clustering separates high population regions of conformational space from others that are rarely visited. In this way, density-based clustering naturally implements assignment of the data based on transitions between metastable states. As a result, the state definition becomes more consistent with the assumption of Markovianity and the timescales of the slow dynamics of the system are recovered more effectively. We present results of this simplified workflow for a model potential and MD simulations of the alanine dipeptide and the FiP35 WW domain.</p>",2021-05-16

Collected from Poynter Institute’s official website and following a quantitative content analysis method along with descriptive statistical analysis, this research produces some novel insights regarding COVID-19 misinformation. The findings show that India (15.94%), the US (9.74%), Brazil (8.57%), and Spain (8.03%) are the four most misinformation-affected countries. Based on the results, it is presumed that the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation can have a positive association with the COVID-19 situation. Social media (84.94%) produces the highest amount of misinformation, and the internet (90.5%) as a whole is responsible for most of the COVID-19 misinformation. Moreover, Facebook alone produces 66.87% misinformation among all social media platforms. Of all countries, India (18.07%) produced the highest amount of social media misinformation, perhaps thanks to the country’s higher internet penetration rate, increasing social media consumption, and users’ lack of internet literacy. On the other hand, countries like Turkey, the US, Brazil, and the Philippines where either political control over media is intense or political conservatism is apparent, experienced a higher amount of misinformation from mainstream media, political figures, and celebrities. Although the prevalence of misinformation was the highest in March 2020, given the present trends, it may likely to increase slightly in 2021.</p>",2021-05-12

Identifying pathogenic SAVs can aid in the diagnosis and understanding of the genetic architecture of complex diseases, such as cancer. Most approaches for predicting the functional effects or pathogenicity of SAVs rely on either sequence or structural information. Nevertheless, previous analyses have shown that methods that depend on only sequence or structural information may have limited accuracy. Recently, researchers have attempted to increase the accuracy of their predictions by incorporating protein dynamics into pathogenicity predictions. This study presents &lt; Lai Yang Rubenstein Uzun Sarkar &gt; (LYRUS), a machine learning method that uses an XGBoost classifier selected by TPOT to predict the pathogenicity of SAVs. LYRUS incorporates five sequence-based features, six structure-based features, and four dynamics-based features. Uniquely, LYRUS includes a newly-proposed sequence co-evolution feature called variation number. LYRUS’s performance was evaluated using a dataset that contains 4,363 protein structures corresponding to 20,307 SAVs based on human genetic variant data from the ClinVar database. Based on our dataset, the LYRUS classifier has a higher accuracy, specificity, F-measure, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) than alternative methods including PolyPhen2, PROVEAN, SIFT, Rhapsody, EVMutation, MutationAssessor, SuSPect, FATHMM, and MVP. Variation numbers used within LYRUS differ greatly between pathogenic and neutral SAVs, and have a high feature weight in the XGBoost classifier employed by this method. Applications of the method to PTEN and TP53 further corroborate LYRUS’s strong performance.

We use RNAseq to identify candidate expression markers, and test these markers using qPCR in laboratory-reared <italic>Glossina morstians morsitans</italic> of known age. Measuring the expression of six genes was sufficient to obtain a prediction of age with root mean squared error of less than 8 days, while just two genes were sufficient to classify flies into age categories of ≤ 15 and &gt;15 days old. Further testing of these markers in field-caught samples and in other species will determine the accuracy of these markers in the field.</p>",2021-05-13

Each vaccine can induce spike-specific antibodies (Abs) with virus-neutralizing activities; however, the Fc-mediated Ab activities have received little attention. Moreover, while plasma/serum Abs are commonly studied, scant information is available about Abs in the respiratory mucosa, the site of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Methods: Plasma and saliva were collected from mRNA vaccine recipients and convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Antigen-specific total Ig and Ig isotypes were measured. In addition to virus neutralization, Fc-mediated activities were investigated, including antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and complement deposition. 
Results: Similar to infection, vaccination stimulated spike-specific Ab responses detected in plasma and saliva, with IgG1 as the dominant isotype. Interestingly, vaccination produced greater IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 responses and higher ratios of (IgG1+IgG3)/(IgG2+IgG4) than infection. Moreover, while plasma neutralization and ADCP potencies were comparable in vaccinated and convalescent individuals, vaccine-induced plasma Abs elicited stronger complement binding and activation.
Conclusion: Compared with natural infection, mRNA vaccines induced a greater array of IgG subtypes against spike in saliva and plasma. The vaccine-induced Abs were also more potent in mediating complement activation.</p>",2021-05-17

One application where this is particularly relevant are CRISPR-based gene drives, which promise a mechanism for rapid genetic alteration of entire populations. The performance of such drives can strongly depend on fitness costs experienced by drive carriers, yet relatively little is known about the magnitude and causes of these costs. Here, we assess the fitness effects of genomic CRISPR/Cas9 expression in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> cage populations by tracking allele frequencies of four different transgenic constructs, designed to disentangle direct fitness costs due to the integration, expression, and target-site activity of Cas9 from costs due to potential off-target cleavage. Using a maximum likelihood framework, we find a moderate level of fitness costs due to off-target effects but do not detect significant direct costs. Costs of off-target effects are minimized for a construct with Cas9HF1, a high-fidelity version of Cas9. We further demonstrate that using Cas9HF1 instead of standard Cas9 in a homing drive achieves similar drive conversion efficiency.

Superficial white matter (SWM) changes have been relatively understudied despite their importance in cortico-cortical connections. Measuring SWM degeneration using diffusion tensor imaging is challenging due to its complex structure and proximity to the cortex. To overcome this we investigated diffusion MRI changes in young-onset Alzheimer’s disease using standard diffusion tensor imaging and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging to distinguish between disease-related changes that are due to degeneration (e.g. loss of myelinated fibres) and those due to reorganisation (e.g. increased fibre dispersion). Twenty-nine young-onset Alzheimer’s disease patients and 22 healthy controls had both single-shell and multi-shell diffusion MRI. We calculated fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, neurite density index, orientation dispersion index and tissue fraction (1-free water fraction). Diffusion metrics were sampled in 15 <italic>a priori</italic> regions of interest at four points along the cortical profile: cortical grey matter, the grey/white boundary, SWM (1mm below grey/white boundary) and SWM/deeper white matter (2mm below grey/white boundary). To estimate cross-sectional group differences, we used average marginal effects from linear mixed effect models of participants’ diffusion metrics along the cortical profile. The SWM of young-onset Alzheimer’s disease individuals had lower neurite density index compared to controls in five regions (superior and inferior parietal, precuneus, entorhinal and parahippocampus) (all <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05), and higher orientation dispersion index in three regions (fusiform, entorhinal and parahippocampus) (all <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05).

This is especially apparent in marine systems as the world’s oceans are warming at an unprecedented rate, causing dramatic changes to coastal marine systems, especially on coral reefs of the Caribbean. We used three complementary ocean temperature databases (HadISST, Pathfinder, and OISST) to quantify change in thermal characteristics of Caribbean coral reefs over the last 150 years (1871–2020). These sea surface temperature (SST) databases included combined <italic>in situ</italic> and satellite-derived SST (HadISST, OISST), as well as satellite-only observations (Pathfinder) at multiple spatial resolutions. We also compiled a Caribbean coral reef database identifying 5,326 unique reefs across the region. We found that Caribbean reefs have warmed on average by 0.20 °C per decade since 1987, the calculated year that rapid warming began on Caribbean reefs. Further, geographic variation in warming rates ranged from 0.17 °C per decade on Bahamian reefs to 0.26 °C per decade on reefs within the Southern and Eastern Caribbean ecoregions. If this linear rate of warming continues, these already threatened ecosystems would warm by an <italic>additional</italic> 1.6 °C on average by 2100. We also found that marine heatwave (MHW) events are increasing in both frequency and duration across the Caribbean. Caribbean coral reefs now experience on average 5 MHW events annually, compared to 1 per year in the early 1980s. Combined, these changes have caused a dramatic shift in the composition and function of Caribbean coral reef ecosystems. If reefs continue to warm at this rate, we are likely to lose even the remnant Caribbean coral reef communities of today in the coming decades.</p>",2021-05-13

We hypothesized that SAR11 cells transport and metabolize multiple polyamines and use them as sources of carbon and nitrogen. Metabolic footprinting and fingerprinting were used to measure the uptake of five polyamine compounds (putrescine, cadaverine, agmatine, norspermidine, and spermidine) in two SAR11 strains that represent the majority of SAR11 cells in the surface ocean environment, <italic>Ca.</italic> Pelagibacter st.

We provide experimental support for this hypothesis by demonstrating that SAR11 cells use multiple polyamine compounds and propose that a small set of multifunctional genes catalyze this metabolism. We also report polyamine uptake rates can exceed metabolism, resulting in high intracellular concentrations of these nitrogen-rich compounds and an increase in cell size. Increases in cytoplasmic solute concentrations during transient episodes of high nutrient exposure has previously been observed in SAR11 cells and may be a feature of their strategy for maximizing the share of labile DOM acquired when in competition with other cell types.</p></sec>",2021-05-15

We set out to build both tissue-specific and multi-tissue transcriptomic clocks to make global tissue age predictions in individuals from GTEx. Existing work in the field primarily uses epigenetic clocks as predictors of age, but these models have known issues and are significantly less interpretable than their transcriptomic counterparts. Due to their transcriptomic nature, we can use these models to directly infer mechanisms of aging from their features. Linear regression remains the current standard analysis technique, but we improved upon its baseline performance with modern techniques, exploring both XGBoost and MLPs. We also experimented with using deconvolved cell data for predictions, which account for cellular composition and reduce signal distortion from rare cell types. Since it is known that the heterogeneity of cell types in particular tissues can lead to noise in these models, we proposed using deconvolution as a potential remedy for this problem.</p><p>Our results found that MLPs are not well suited for the task due to a lack of training data, but the use of XGBoost is effective at improving the baseline performance of predictions of existing tissue-specific clocks. These models allowed us to directly compute genes most important to age prediction in our models, and we showed that multiple genes found have been independently identified elsewhere to show evidence of correlation with age. Given the small size of our datasets, we were unable to make conclusive determinations about multi-tissue predictors, but preliminary results suggest that the technique shows promise and is worthy of future investigation. Likewise, given our limited deconvolved cell data, we did not currently observe strong results, but we again note that this is an area in need of further investigation.</p><p>By improving upon the performance of existing models, we demonstrated that a novel machine learning technique, XGBoost, can be an effective technique to further our understanding of aging mechanisms by extraction of the most relevant genes found in those models. This is significant because the genetic causes of aging are still not fully understood, and research in the field of aging is lacking in comparison to other domains. As the problem of identifying tissues that age at different rates is of specific interest, our tissue-specific models potentially have other applications in this domain, including informing pathologies in tissues that are found to be aging faster, or analyzing how people with similar ages can have vastly different tissue ages.

The goal of this study was to compare the genetic interactions and the impact on transcriptome and cellular growth of two tRNA variants that mistranslate at a similar frequency but create different amino acid substitutions in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</italic> One tRNA variant inserts alanine at proline codons whereas the other inserts serine for arginine. Both tRNAs decreased growth rate, with the effect being greater for arginine to serine than for proline to alanine. The tRNA that substituted serine for arginine resulted in a heat shock response. In contrast, heat shock response was minimal for proline to alanine substitution. Further demonstrating the significance of the amino acid substitution, transcriptome analysis identified unique up- and downregulated genes in response to each mistranslating tRNA. Number and extent of negative synthetic genetic interactions also differed depending upon type of mistranslation. Based on the unique responses observed for these mistranslating tRNAs, we predict that the potential of mistranslation to exacerbate diseases caused by proteotoxic stress depends on the tRNA variant.

Using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we show that NEIL1 interacts with RPA through two contact points. An interaction with the RPA32C protein recruitment domain was mapped to a motif in the common interaction domain (CID) of NEIL1 and a dissociation constant (Kd) of 200 nM was measured. A substantially weaker secondary interaction with the tandem RPA70AB ssDNA binding domains was also mapped to the CID.

The complexity of interspecies interactions, which are key for the macroscopic behavior of microbial communities, cannot be studied easily experimentally. For this reason, the modeling of microbial communities has begun to leverage the knowledge of established constraint-based methods, which have long been used for studying and analyzing the microbial metabolism of individual species based on genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of microorganisms. A main problem of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions is that they usually contain metabolic gaps due to genome misannotations and unknown enzyme functions. This problem is traditionally solved by using gap-filling algorithms that add biochemical reactions from external databases to the metabolic reconstruction, in order to restore model growth. However, gap-filling algorithms could evolve by taking into account metabolic interactions among species that coexist in microbial communities. In this work, a gap-filling method that resolves metabolic gaps at the community level was developed.

Yet, in the context of behavioral neuroscience and pharmacological studies, social context of adult animals is often ignored. When social context has been studied in adult monkeys, such studies have typically focused on welfare-related issues, as social isolation often leads to the development of abnormal behavior, rather than the impact on outcomes in behavioral neuroscience studies. Variation in social housing conditions for adult animals could have an impact on affective responding and may have significant implications for the interpretation of data from biopsychiatry and behavioral neuroscience studies. We evaluated the affective reactivity of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) maintained in one of four housing conditions (individually-housed, grate-paired, intermittently-paired, and continuously-paired) using two classic threat processing tasks: a test of responsivity to objects and the Human Intruder Test. Individually-housed monkeys exhibited consistently blunted sensitivity to ostensibly threatening stimuli as compared to socially-housed monkeys. Within the three socially-housed conditions, intermittently- and continuously-paired monkeys behaved similarly to each other and grate-paired monkeys exhibited relatively enhanced sensitivity to threatening stimuli. These findings suggest that the adult housing conditions of monkeys can robustly modulate affective responding in a way that may be consistent with behavioral phenotypes observed in human psychiatric conditions. Results are considered in the context of the broad behavioral and psychiatric neuroscience literatures, which have historically used individually-housed animals, pointing to the potential need to reconsider inferences drawn from those studies.</p>",2021-05-17

These approaches are limited in the analysis of the endothelium in human brain tissues, where fresh samples are difficult to obtain. Here, we developed an approach to examine endothelial RNA expression by using an endothelial-specific marker to isolate nuclei from abundant archived frozen brain tissues. We show that this approach rapidly and reliably extracts endothelial nuclei from frozen mouse brain samples, and importantly, from archived frozen human brain tissues. Furthermore, isolated RNA transcript levels are closely correlated with expression in whole cells from tissue digestion protocols and are enriched in endothelial markers and depleted of markers of other brain cell types. As high-quality RNA transcripts could be obtained from as few as 100 nuclei in archived frozen human brain tissues, we predict that this approach should be useful for both bulk analysis of endothelial RNA transcripts in human brain tissues as well as single-cell analysis of endothelial sub-populations.</p>",2021-05-13

We observed high intra- and inter-individual variability in the antibody response to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for each of the three isotypes IgA, IgM and IgG. Protease domain (MPro) antibodies were also detected in milk. In general, 82.9 % of the milk samples were positive for at least one of the three antibody isotypes, being 52.86 % of those positive for all three Igs.

The SP consists of oligomeric Spa33 “pods” that associate with the basal body via MxiK and connect to the Spa47 ATPase via MxiN.

In two-hybrid analyses, association of the Spa33 complex with these proteins occurs via the full-length Spa33 component. Furthermore, these complexes each have distinct biophysical properties. Based on these properties, new high-resolution cryo-electron tomography data and architectural similarities between the Spa33 and flagellar FliM-FliN complexes, we provide a preliminary model of the Spa33 heterotrimers within the SP pods.

ACE2 receptors are normally expressed in various body surfaces as well as in the neurons and glial cells where they act as an entry port to SARS-CoV-2 infection to invade the central nervous system (CNS). ACE2 are also highly expressed in dopamine neurons which might worsen the outcome in terms of motor symptoms in PD with the treatment course. It may lead to an indirect response via immune-mediated cytokine storms and propagate through CNS leading to damage.

When repeatedly exposed to predictable prey, the predators adjusted their behaviour before the prey even began to escape: prey programmed to escape directly away were approached more rapidly than prey escaping at an acute angle. These faster approach speeds compensated for a longer time needed to capture such prey during the subsequent pursuit phase, and predators showed greater acceleration when pursuing unpredictable prey.

In aggregative multicellularity, development is itself a social process in which unicellular organisms cooperate in carrying out complex developmental programs. In some aggregative systems, development culminates in the construction of spore-packed fruiting bodies. Fruiting body development in myxobacteria often unfolds within genetically and behaviorally diverse conspecific cellular environments that can include social defection and warfare. Here we use the bacterium <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> to test whether the character of the cellular environment during aggregative development shapes morphological evolution. We manipulated the cellular composition of <italic>Myxococcus</italic> development in an experiment in which evolving populations initiated from a single ancestor repeatedly co-developed with one of several non-evolving partners - a benign cooperator, one of three cheaters or one of three antagonists. Fruiting body morphology was found to diversify as a function of developmental partners, revealing adaptation specific to distinct cellular environments. Collectively, antagonistic partners selected for higher levels of robust fruiting body formation than did cheaters or the benign cooperator. Moreover, even small degrees of genetic divergence between the distinct cheater partners were sufficient to drive treatment-level morphological divergence. Co-developmental partners not only shaped mean trait evolution but also determined the magnitude and dynamics of stochastic morphological diversification and subsequent convergence. In sum, we find that even few genetic differences affecting developmental and social features can greatly impact the morphological evolution of multicellular bodies and experimentally demonstrate that microbial warfare can promote cooperation.</p>",2021-05-13

Here we look at some of the characteristics of the adult Drosophila brain, a result of this development process. From this we can speculate on at least some aspects of how the wiring was done. A common hypothesis is that surface proteins direct synapse formation among touching neurons. Assuming that surface proteins are specific to cell types, we find support for this hypothesis. The brain in general supports a wide variety of connections of different degrees of reciprocity, with ratios up to a thousand to one in the two directions of synapses between types. However, contacts between cells of the same type are always bi-directional and nearly equal strength. Furthermore, among similar cell types, at least in the mushroom body, the closer the cell type by morphology, the closer the inter-type contacts are to symmetrical. These findings are all consistent with the hypothesis that surface proteins specific to cell types determine the directivity of connections. Next we look at synapses per area, and find this varies widely and is roughly log-normally distributed. In most cases, the number of synapses saturates at higher areas, though other forms are seen - linear, flat, or decreasing with increasing area. Evidence suggests that at least some of this distinction is post-synaptic.</p>",2021-05-16

We show the effects of parameter settings on PAM measurements. We first simulated fluorescence signals using a previously published computational model of photosynthesis.

However, fresh residue inputs could also “prime” the decomposition of native SOM, resulting in accelerated SOM depletion and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Increasing the botanical diversity of the crops grown in arable systems has been promoted to increase the delivery of multiple ecological functions, including increasing soil microbial biomass and SOM. Whether mixtures of fresh residues from different crops grown in polyculture contribute to soil carbon (C) pools to a greater extent than would be expected from applying individual residues (i.e., the mixture produces a non-additive synergistic effect) has not been systematically tested and is currently unknown. In this study, we used <sup>13</sup>C isotope labelled cover crop residues (i.e., buckwheat, clover, radish, and sunflower) to track the fate of plant residue-derived C and C derived from the priming of SOM in treatments comprising a quaternary mixture of the residues and the average effect of the four individual residues one day after residue incorporation in a laboratory microcosm experiment. Our results indicate that, despite all treatments receiving the same amount of plant residue-derived C (1 mg<sup>-1</sup> C g soil), the total microbial biomass in the treatment receiving the residue mixture was significantly greater, by 26% (3.69 µg<sup>-1</sup> C g), than the average microbial biomass observed in treatments receiving the four individual components of the mixture one day after applying crop residues. The greater microbial biomass C in the quaternary mixture, compared to average of the individual residue treatments, that can be attributed directly to the plant residue applied was also significantly greater, by 132% (3.61 µg<sup>-1</sup> C g).

Our study demonstrates that applying a mixture of crop residues increases soil microbial biomass to a greater extent than would be expected from applying individual residues and that this occurs either due to faster decomposition of the crop residues or greater carbon use efficiency (CUE), rather than priming the decomposition of native SOM.

Damage triggers perturbations of the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) that spread from cell to cell (known as intercellular Ca2+ waves) in different epithelia, including epidermis. Ca2+ waves are considered a fundamental mechanism for coordinating multicellular responses, however the mechanisms underlying their propagation in the damaged epidermis are incompletely understood. AIM OF THE PROJECT: To dissect the molecular components contributing to Ca2+ wave propagation in murine model of epidermal photodamage. METHODS: To trigger Ca2+ waves, we used intense and focused pulsed laser radiation and targeted a single keratinocyte of the epidermal basal layer in the earlobe skin of live anesthetized mice. To track photodamage-evoked Ca2+ waves, we performed intravital multiphoton microscopy in transgenic mice with ubiquitous expression of the sensitive and selective Ca2+ biosensor GCaMP6s. To dissect the molecular components contributing to Ca2+ wave propagation, we performed in vivo pharmacological interference experiments by intradermal microinjection of different drugs. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: The major effects of drugs that interfere with degradation of extracellular ATP or P2 purinoceptors suggest that Ca2+ waves in the photodamaged epidermis are primarily due to release of ATP from the target cell, whose plasma membrane integrity was compromised by laser irradiation. The limited effect of the Connexin 43 (Cx43) selective inhibitor TAT-Gap19 suggests ATP-dependent ATP release though connexin hemichannels (HCs) plays a minor role, affecting Ca2+ wave propagation only at larger distances, where the concentration of ATP released from the photodamaged cell was reduced by the combined effect of passive diffusion and hydrolysis due to the action of ectonucleotidases. The ineffectiveness of probenecid suggests pannexin channels have no role. As GCaMP6s signals in bystander keratinocytes were augmented by exposure to the Ca2+ chelator EGTA in the extracellular medium, the corresponding transient increments of the [Ca2+]c should be ascribed primarily to Ca2+ release from the ER, downstream of ATP binding to P2Y purinoceptors, with Ca2+ entry through plasma membrane channels playing a comparatively negligible role. The effect of thapsigargin (a well-known inhibitor of SERCA pumps) and carbenoxolone (a recently recognized inhibitor of Ca2+ release through IP3 receptors) support this conclusion. CONCLUSIONS: The one presented here is an experimental model for accidental skin injury that may also shed light on the widespread medical practice of laser skin resurfacing, used to treat a range of pathologies from photodamage and acne scars to hidradenitis suppurativa and posttraumatic scarring from basal cell carcinoma excision. The results of our experiments support the notion that Ca2+ waves reflect chiefly the sequential activation of bystander keratinocytes by the ATP released through the compromised plasma membrane of the cell hit by laser radiation. We attributed the observed increments of the [Ca2+]c chiefly to signal transduction through purinergic P2Y receptors. Several studies have highlighted fundamental roles of P2Y receptors during inflammatory and infectious diseases, and the initial phase of wound healing involves acute inflammation. In addition, hyaluronan is a major component of the extracellular matrix and its synthesis is rapidly upregulated after tissue wounding via P2Y receptor activation. It is tempting to speculate that response coordination after injury in the epidermis occurs via propagation of the ATP-dependent intercellular Ca2+ waves described in this work.</p>",2021-05-16

While fMRI almost systematically relies on the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast, there is an increasing interest in alternative methods that would not rely on neurovascular coupling. A promising but controversial such alternative is diffusion fMRI (dfMRI), which relies instead on dynamic fluctuations in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) due to microstructural changes underlying neuronal activity. However, it is unclear whether genuine dfMRI contrast, distinct from BOLD contamination, can be detected in the human brain in physiological conditions. Here, we present the first dfMRI study in humans attempting to minimize all BOLD contamination sources and comparing functional responses at two field strengths (3T and 7T), both for task and resting-state (RS) fMRI. Our study benefits from unprecedented high spatiotemporal resolution and harnesses novel denoising strategies. We report task-induced decrease in ADC with temporal and spatial features distinct from the BOLD response and yielding more specific activation maps. Furthermore, we report dfMRI RS connectivity which, compared to its BOLD counterpart, is essentially free from physiological artifacts and preserves positive correlations but preferentially suppresses anti-correlations, which are likely of vascular origin. A careful acquisition and processing design thus enable the detection of genuine dfMRI contrast on clinical MRI systems.

Dynein, in turn, is responsible for the transport and localization of these mRNAs. Studies have shown that efficient mRNA binding by Egl requires the protein to dimerize. We recently demonstrated that Dynein light chain (Dlc) is responsible for facilitating the dimerization of Egl. Mutations in Egl that fail to interact with Dlc do not dimerize, and as such, are defective for mRNA binding. Consequently, this mutant does not efficiently associate with BicaudalD (BicD), the factor responsible for linking the Egl/mRNA complex with Dynein. In this report, we tested whether artificially dimerizing this Dlc-binding mutant using a leucine zipper would restore mRNA binding and rescue mutant phenotypes in vivo. Interestingly, we found that although artificial dimerization of Egl restored BicD binding, it only partially restored mRNA binding. As a result, Egl-dependent phenotypes, such as oocyte specification and mRNA localization, were only partially rescued. We hypothesize that Dlc-mediated dimerization of Egl results in a three-dimensional conformation of the Egl dimer that is best suited for mRNA binding. Although the leucine zipper restores Egl dimerization, it likely does not enable Egl to assemble into the conformation required for maximal mRNA binding activity.</p>",2021-05-13

Matching this finding, deficits in several classical tasks are predicted by loss of fluid intelligence, linked to damage in a specific cortical “multiple-demand” (MD) network, while deficits in a more naturalistic task are not. To expand on these previous results, we examined the effect of focal brain lesions on three new tests – a modification of the previously-used Hotel task, a new test of task switching after extended delays, and a test of decision-making in imagined real-life scenarios.

The results confirm that naturalistic tasks capture cognitive deficits beyond those measured by fluid intelligence.

We utilized high temporal-resolution gene-expression data from <italic>in vitro</italic> erythrocyte-neutrophil differentiation and a predictive data-driven dynamical modeling framework to learn the architecture and dynamics of gene regulation in a comprehensive twelve-gene GRN. The inferred genetic architecture is densely interconnected rather than hierarchical. The analysis of model dynamics revealed that neutrophil differentiation is driven by C/EBP<italic>α</italic> and Gfi1 rather than PU.1. This prediction is supported by the sequence of gene up-regulation in an independent mouse bone marrow scRNA-Seq dataset. These results imply that neutrophil differentiation is not driven by the Gata1-PU.1 switch but by neutrophil-specific genes instead. More generally, this work shows that data-driven dynamical modeling can uncover the causality of developmental events that might otherwise be obscured.</p>",2021-05-11

However, understanding of RNA homodimerization has been hampered by the lack of systematic in vivo detection methods. Here we show that PARIS, COMRADES, and other RNA proximity ligation methods can detect RNA homodimers transcriptome-wide as ""overlapping"" chimeric reads that contain more than one copy of the same sequence. Analysing published proximity ligation datasets, we show that RNA:RNA homodimers mediated by direct base-pairing interactions are rare across the transcriptome, but highly enriched in specific transcripts, including U8 snoRNA, U2 snRNA and a subset of tRNAs. Analysis of data from virus-infected cells reveals homodimerization of SARS-CoV-2 and Zika genomes, mediated by specific palindromic sequences located within protein-coding regions of N protein in SARS-CoV-2 and NS2A gene in Zika. We speculate that regions of viral genomes involved in homodimerization may constitute effective targets for antiviral therapies.</p>",2021-05-17

Jones'}, {'name': 'Jose M. Pozo'}, {'name': 'Sarah Baxendale'}, {'name': 'Tanya T. Whitfield'}, {'name': 'Alejandro F. Frangi'}]","<p>A common feature of morphogenesis is the formation of three-dimensional structures from the folding of two-dimensional epithelial sheets aided by spatio-temporal cell shape changes at the cellular-level. Studying cell shape dynamics and polarised processes that underpin them, requires orienting cells within the epithelial sheet. In epithelia with highly curved surfaces, assigning cell orientation can be difficult to automate <italic>in silico</italic>. We present ‘Origami’, a MATLAB-based image analysis pipeline to compute oriented cell shape-features. Our automated method accurately computed cell orientation in regions with opposing curvature in synthetic epithelia and fluorescence images of zebrafish embryos. As proof of concept, we identified different cell shape signatures in the developing zebrafish inner ear, where the epithelium deforms in opposite orientations to form different structures. Origami is designed to be user-friendly and is generally applicable to fluorescence images of curved epithelia.</p>",2021-05-13

However, the mechanism by which long-range order emerges through complex interactions, particularly in the prokaryotic domain, remains elusive. Here we report, in growing <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> biofilms, a reorientation cascade consisting of cell verticalization in the core and radial alignment in the rim, generating a pattern reminiscent of a blooming aster. Single-cell imaging combined with agent-based simulations reveal that cell verticalization and radial alignment are spatiotemporally coupled, each generating the driving force for the other, to cause a dynamic cascade of differential orientational ordering. Such self-patterning is absent in nonadherent mutants but can be restored through opto-manipulation of growth. A two-phase active nematic model is developed to elucidate the mechanism underlying biofilm self-patterning, which offers insights into the control of organization in complex bacterial communities.</p><sec><title>One-Sentence Summary</title><p>Bacterial biofilms robustly pattern themselves through orientation-dependent, growth induced flows.</p></sec>",2021-05-11
