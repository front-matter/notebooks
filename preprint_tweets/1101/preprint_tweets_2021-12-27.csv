Although anecdotal reports have been circulating that Omicron is in principle detectable by Ag-RDTs, no published data are a yet available for the newly emerged Omicron variant. Here, we have performed an analytical sensitivity testing with cultured virus in seven Ag-RDTs for their sensitivity to Omicron compared to data earlier obtained on VOCs Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta and a pre-VOC isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, we have found a tendency towards lower sensitivity for Omicron compared to pre-VOC SARS-CoV-2 and the other VOCs across tests. Importantly, while analytical testing with cultured virus may be a proxy for clinical sensitivity, is not a replacement for clinical evaluations which are urgently needed for Ag-RDT performance in Omicron-infected individuals.</p>",2021-12-22

Here we show that compared to the Delta variant, Omicron BA.1 confers very significant evasion of therapeutic monoclonal and vaccine-elicited polyclonal neutralising antibodies after two doses. mRNA vaccination as a third vaccine dose rescues and broadens neutralisation in the short term. Importantly, antiviral drugs remdesevir and molnupiravir retain efficacy against Omicron BA.1. Despite three mutations predicted to favour spike S1/S2 cleavage, observed cleavage efficiency is substantially lower than for Delta. Omicron spike pseudotyped virus (PV) entry into lower airway organoids and Calu-3 lung cells was impaired. This defect for Omicron, but not Delta spike PV, correlated with higher cellular expression of TMPRSS2 transcripts, as determined by single cell RNA seq. Indeed we showed that in lung cells expressing TMPRSS2, live Omicron virus demonstrated significantly lower replication in comparison to Delta. This phenotype was reflected in cells where TMPRSS2 expression could be manipulated, with Omicron showing no change in entry in the presence of TMPRSS2. Cell-cell fusion mediated by spike glycoprotein is known require S1/S2 cleavage, but is also dependent on presence of TMPRSS2; fusogenicity of the Omicron BA.1 spike was severely impaired despite TMPRSS2 expression, leading to marked reduction in syncytium formation compared to Delta spike. These <italic>in vitro</italic> data indicate that suboptimal Omicron S1/S2 cleavage reduces efficient infection of lower airway cells expressing TMPRSS2, but not TMPRSS2 negative cells such as those found in the upper airway.

We developed a high-throughput neutralization assay for Omicron SARS-CoV-2 by engineering the Omicron spike gene into an mNeonGreen USA-WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 (isolated in January 2020). Using this assay, we determined the neutralization titers of patient sera collected at 1- or 6-months after infection with non-Omicron SARS-CoV-2.

Profiling tumors at the single-cell level in individual cancer types has shown that transcriptional heterogeneity is organized into cancer cell states, implying that diverse cell states may represent stable and functional units with complementary roles in tumor maintenance and progression. However, it remains unclear to what extent these states span tumor types, constituting general features of cancer. Furthermore, the role of cancer cell states in tumor progression and their specific interactions with cells of the tumor microenvironment remain to be elucidated. Here, we perform a pan-cancer single-cell RNA-Seq analysis across 15 cancer types and identify a catalog of 16 gene modules whose expression defines recurrent cancer cell states, including ‘stress’, ‘interferon response’, ‘epithelial-mesenchymal transition’, ‘metal response’, ‘basal’ and ‘ciliated’. Using mouse models, we find that induction of the interferon response module varies by tumor location and is diminished upon elimination of lymphocytes. Moreover, spatial transcriptomic analysis further links the interferon response in cancer cells to T cells and macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. Our work provides a framework for studying how cancer cell states interact with the tumor microenvironment to form organized systems capable of immune evasion, drug resistance, and metastasis.</p>",2021-12-21

The Omicron variant, which emerged in November 2021, consists of over 30 mutations within the spike protein. Here, we used an authentic live virus neutralization assay to examine the neutralizing activity of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant against mRNA vaccine-induced antibody responses. Following the 2nd dose, we observed a 30-fold reduction in neutralizing activity against the omicron variant. Through six months after the 2nd dose, none of the sera from naïve vaccinated subjects showed neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant. In contrast, recovered vaccinated individuals showed a 22-fold reduction with more than half of the subjects retaining neutralizing antibody responses. Following a booster shot (3rd dose), we observed a 14-fold reduction in neutralizing activity against the omicron variant and over 90% of boosted subjects showed neutralizing activity against the omicron variant.

We build upon this observation and exome sequencing from 154,842 individuals to explore the allelic diversity of rare protein-coding variation contributing risk for ASD and related NDDs. Using an integrative statistical model, we jointly analyzed rare protein-truncating variants (PTVs), damaging missense variants, and copy number variants (CNVs) derived from exome sequencing of 63,237 individuals from ASD cohorts. We discovered 71 genes associated with ASD at a false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.001, a threshold approximately equivalent to exome-wide significance, and 183 genes at FDR ≤ 0.05. Associations were predominantly driven by <italic>de novo</italic> PTVs, damaging missense variants, and CNVs: 57.4%, 21.2%, and 8.32% of evidence, respectively. Though fewer in number, CNVs conferred greater relative risk than PTVs, and repeat-mediated <italic>de novo</italic> CNVs exhibited strong maternal bias in parent-of-origin (e.g., 92.3% of 16p11.2 CNVs), whereas all other CNVs showed a paternal bias. To explore how genes associated with ASD and NDD overlap or differ, we analyzed our ASD cohort alongside a developmental delay (DD) cohort from the deciphering developmental disorders study (DDD; n=91,605 samples). We first reanalyzed the DDD dataset using the same models as the ASD cohorts, then performed joint analyses of both cohorts and identified 373 genes contributing to NDD risk at FDR ≤ 0.001 and 662 NDD risk genes at FDR ≤ 0.05. Of these NDD risk genes, 54 genes (125 genes at FDR ≤ 0.05) were unique to the joint analyses and not significant in either cohort alone. Our results confirm overlap of most ASD and DD risk genes, although many differ significantly in frequency of mutation. Analyses of single-cell transcriptome datasets showed that genes associated predominantly with DD were strongly enriched for earlier neurodevelopmental cell types, whereas genes displaying stronger evidence for association in ASD cohorts were more enriched for maturing neurons. The ASD risk genes were also enriched for genes associated with schizophrenia from a separate rare coding variant analysis of 121,570 individuals, emphasizing that these neuropsychiatric disorders share common pathways to risk.</p>",2021-12-21

Our cross-species analyses revealed that the cellular composition and differentiation dynamics throughout cerebellum development are largely conserved, except for human Purkinje cells. Global transcriptome profiles, conserved cell state markers, and gene expression trajectories across neuronal differentiation show that the cerebellar cell type-defining programs have been overall preserved for at least 160 million years. However, we also discovered differences. We identified 3,586 genes that either gained or lost expression in cerebellar cells in one of the species, and 541 genes that evolved new expression trajectories during neuronal differentiation.

Produced by V(D)J recombination, TCRs are often only recorded in the literature and data repositories as a combination of their V and J gene symbols, plus their hypervariable CDR3 amino acid sequence. However, numerous applications require full-length coding nucleotide sequences. Here we present Stitchr, a software tool developed to specifically address this limitation. Given minimal V/J/CDR3 information, Stitchr produces complete coding sequences representing a fully spliced TCR cDNA. Due to its modular design, Stitchr can be used for TCR engineering using either published germline or novel/modified variable and constant region sequences. Sequences produced by Stitchr were validated by synthesizing and transducing TCR sequences into Jurkat cells, recapitulating the expected antigen specificity of the parental TCR. Using a companion script, Thimble, we demonstrate that Stitchr can process a million TCRs in under ten minutes using a standard desktop personal computer. By systemizing the production and modification of TCR sequences, we propose that Stitchr will increase the speed, repeatability, and reproducibility of TCR research.

In response, several jurisdictions have authorized the administration of booster doses. Since August 13, 2021, Puerto Rico has administered 540,140 booster shots. We used data collected and made public by the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) to evaluate the effectiveness of four different booster regimens at preventing SARS-CoV-2 laboratory confirmed infections and adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Specifically, we analyzed data from all 115,995 SARS-CoV-2 infections occurring since the vaccination process commenced on December 15, 2020. We combined vaccination status, SARS-CoV-2 test results, and COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths data, and fit a statistical model that adjusted for time-varying incidence rates and age group, to estimate time-varying vaccine effectiveness against infection and adverse outcomes. We find that, after 6 months, the mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 effectiveness against infection wanes substantially to 61% (58%-63%) and 36% (34%-39%), respectively, while the Ad26.COV2.S wanes to 35% (31%-39%) after two months. However, after a booster shot of the corresponding initial vaccine manufacturer, effectiveness increased to 87% (83%-91%) and 82% (79%-85%) for mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2, respectively. The effectiveness for Ad26.COV2.S followed by either a mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 booster increased to 88% (71%-100%), substantially higher than 65% (59%-70%), the peak effectiveness reached with just one shot. We also found that heterologous booster regimens restored effectiveness. Furthermore, we did not observe waning after two months of the booster shot.

We find that the anterior and posterior regions of the mosquito midgut possess clearly delineated digestive specializations which are preserved in the blood-fed state. Blood feeding initiates the sequential transcriptional induction and repression/depletion of multiple cohorts of peptidases throughout blood meal digestion. With respect to defense, immune signaling components, but not recognition or effector molecules, show enrichment in ovaries. Basal expression of antimicrobial peptides is dominated by two genes, holotricin and gambicin, that are expressed in the carcass and the digestive tissues, respectively, in a near mutually exclusive manner.

We find that CA1 phase precession varies strongly across cells and environmental contingencies. Phase precession depends on the CA1 network state, and is only present when the medium gamma oscillation (60-90 Hz, linked to Entorhinal inputs) dominates. Conversely, theta sequences are most evident for non-precessing cells or with leading slow gamma (20-45 Hz, linked to CA3 inputs).

Repair pathway cross-talk and compensation within the DSB-repair network is incompletely understood, despite its importance for genomic stability, oncogenesis, and the outcome of genome editing by CRISPR/Cas9. To address this, we constructed and validated three fluorescent Cas9-based reporters, named DSB-Spectrum, that simultaneously quantify the contribution of multiple distinct pathways to repair of a DSB. These reporters distinguish between DSB-repair by error-free canonical non-homologous end-joining (c-NHEJ) versus homologous recombination (HR; reporter 1), mutagenic repair versus HR (reporter 2), and mutagenic end-joining versus single strand annealing (SSA) versus HR (reporter 3). Using these reporters, we show that inhibition of the essential c-NHEJ factor DNA-PKcs not only increases repair by HR, but also results in a substantial increase in mutagenic repair by SSA. We show that SSA-mediated repair of Cas9-generated DSBs can occur between Alu elements at endogenous genomic loci, and is enhanced by inhibition of DNA-PKcs. Finally, we demonstrate that the short-range end-resection factors CtIP and Mre11 promote both SSA and HR, whereas the long-range end-resection factors DNA2 and Exo1 promote SSA, but reduce HR, when both pathways compete for the same substrate.

Trans-generational past human mobility is one of the key aspects that ancient genomics can contribute to, since changes in ancestry – unlike cultural changes seen in the archaeological record – necessarily reflect movements of people. Here we present a new algorithm to quantify past human mobility from large ancient genomic datasets. The key idea of the method is for each individual to compare a hypothetical genetic “origin” point with its actual burial point in space. This is achieved by first creating an interpolated ancestry field through space and time based on Multidimensional scaling and Gaussian process regression, and then using this field to map the ancient individuals into space according to their genetic profile. We apply this new algorithm to a dataset of 3191 aDNA samples with genome-wide data from Western Eurasia in the last 10,000 years and derive a diachronic measure of mobility for subregions in Western, Central, Southern and Eastern Europe.

However, the nature of the ion species is rarely taken into account, causing redundancy as a single compound may be present in different forms throughout the network. Taking advantage of the presence of such redundant ions, we developed a new method named MolNotator. Using the different ion species produced by a molecule during ionization (adducts, dimers, trimers, in-source fragments), a predicted molecule node (or neutral node) is created by triangulation, and ultimately computing the associated molecule’s calculated mass. These neutral nodes provide researchers with several advantages. Firstly, each molecule is then represented in its ionization context, connected to all produced ions and indirectly to some coeluted compounds, thereby also highlighting unexpected widely present adduct species. Secondly, the predicted neutrals serve as anchors to merge the complementary positive and negative ionization modes into a single network. Lastly, the dereplication is improved by the use of all available ions connected to the neutral nodes, and the computed molecular masses can be used for exact mass dereplication. MolNotator is available as a Python library and was validated using the lichen database spectra acquired on an Orbitrap, computing neutral molecules for &gt;90% of the 156 molecules in the dataset.

These changes to the distribution of fitness effects can affect both the rate of adaptation and the accumulation of deleterious mutations. However, while numerous models of fitness landscapes have been proposed in the literature, empirical data on how this distribution changes during evolution remains limited. In this study, we directly measure how the fitness landscape neighborhood changes during laboratory adaptation. Using a barcode-based mutagenesis system, we measure the fitness effects of 91 specific gene disruption mutations in genetic backgrounds spanning 8,000-10,000 generations of evolution in two constant environments. We find that the mean of the distribution of fitness effects decreases in one environment, indicating a reduction in mutational robustness, but does not change in the other.

However, sequence-specific binding of Cas13 to the target RNA unleashes non-specific bystander RNA cleavage, or collateral activity, which may confound knockdown experiments and raises concerns for therapeutic applications. Although conserved across orthologs and robust in cell-free and bacterial environments, the extent of collateral activity in mammalian cells remains disputed. Here, we investigate Cas13d collateral activity in the context of an RNA-targeting therapy for myotonic dystrophy type 1, a disease caused by a transcribed long CTG repeat expansion. We find that when targeting CUGn RNA in HeLa and other cell lines, Cas13d depletes endogenous and transgenic RNAs, interferes with critical cellular processes, and activates stress response and apoptosis pathways. We also observe collateral effects when targeting other repetitive and unique transgenic sequences, and we provide evidence for collateral activity when targeting highly expressed endogenous transcripts. To minimize collateral activity for repeat-targeting Cas13d therapeutics, we introduce gRNA excision for negative-autoregulatory optimization (GENO), a simple strategy that leverages crRNA processing to control Cas13d expression and is easily integrated into an AAV gene therapy. We argue that thorough assessment of collateral activity is necessary when applying Cas13d in mammalian cells and that implementation of GENO illustrates the advantages of compact and universally robust regulatory systems for Cas-based gene therapies. </p>",2021-12-21

Findings: In islets collected from female NOD mice at 10, 12, and 14 weeks of age, we found a time-restricted upregulation of proteins involved in the maintenance of β cell function and stress mitigation, followed by loss of expression of protective proteins that heralded diabetes onset.

It has been proposed that prefrontal dopamine has ""inverted U-shaped"" dynamics, with optimal dopamine and D1DR signaling required for optimal cognitive function. However, the quantitative relationship between prefrontal dopamine and cognitive function is not clear. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of published manipulations of prefrontal dopamine and the effects on working memory, a high-level executive function in humans, primates, and rodents that involves maintaining and manipulating information over seconds to minutes. We reviewed 646 papers and found that 75 studies met criteria for inclusion. Our quantification of effect sizes for dopamine, D1DRs, and behavior revealed a negative quadratic slope. This is consistent with the proposed inverted U-shape of prefrontal dopamine and D1DRs and working memory performance, explaining 10% of the variance. Of note, the inverted quadratic fit was much stronger for prefrontal D1DRs alone, explaining 26% of the variance, compared to prefrontal dopamine alone, explaining 10% of the variance. Taken together, these data, derived from a variety of manipulations and systems, demonstrate that optimal prefrontal dopamine signalling is linked with higher cognitive function.

Formal theories analysing the interplay between natural selection and spatial structure have mostly focused on populations divided into distinct, non-overlapping groups. Most populations, however, are not structured in this way, but rather (self-)organise into dynamic patterns unfolding at various spatial scales. Here, we present a mathematical framework that quantifies how patterns and processes at different spatial scales contribute to natural selection in such populations. To that end, we define the Local Selection Differential (LSD): a measure of the selection acting on a trait within a given local environment. Based on the LSD, natural selection in a population can be decomposed into two parts: the contribution of local selection, acting <italic>within</italic> local environments, and the contribution of interlocal selection, acting <italic>among</italic> them. Varying the size of the local environments subsequently allows one to measure the contribution of each length scale.

In both models, the spatial decomposition of selection reveals that local and interlocal selection can have opposite signs, thus providing a mathematically rigorous underpinning to intuitive explanations of how processes at different spatial scales may compete. It furthermore identifies which length scales—and hence which patterns—are relevant for natural selection.

We identify 23 genomic regions with deviated local relatedness patterns, using a chromosome-level de novo assembly of the blackcap genome and whole-genome resequencing data of 179 individuals from nine populations with diverse migratory phenotypes. Five genomic regions show local relatedness patterns of polymorphic inversions, three of which are syntenic to polymorphic inversions known in the zebra finch. Phylogenetic analysis reveals these three polymorphic inversions evolved independently in the blackcap and zebra finch indicating convergence of polymorphic inversions. Population genetic analyses in these three inversions in the blackcap suggest balancing selection between two haplotypes in one locus and background selection in the other two loci. One genomic region with deviated local relatedness is under selection against gene flow by population-specific reduction in recombination rate.

Using genetic depletion approaches, we found that SerpinB3 is necessary for CSC maintenance, survival, and tumor growth, as well as CSC pathway activation. The knockdown of SerpinB3 also increased apoptosis and susceptibility to radiation therapy.

However, the role played by neurons burdened with DSBs in disease-associated neuroinflammation is not well understood. Here, we isolate neurons harboring DSBs from the CK-p25 mouse model of neurodegeneration through fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS), and characterize their transcriptomes using single-nucleus, bulk, and spatial sequencing techniques. We find that neurons harboring DSBs enter a late-stage DNA damage response marked by the activation of senescent and antiviral-like immune pathways. We identify the NFkB transcription factor as a master regulator of immune gene expression in DSB-bearing neurons, and find that the expression of cytokines like Cxcl10 and Ccl2 develop in DSB-bearing neurons before glial cell types. Alzheimers Disease pathology is significantly associated with immune activation in excitatory neurons, and direct purification of DSB-bearing neurons from Alzheimers Disease brain tissue further validates immune gene upregulation. Spatial transcriptomics reveal that regions of brain tissue dense with DSB-bearing neurons also harbor signatures of inflammatory microglia, which is ameliorated by NFkB knock down in neurons. Inhibition of NFkB or depletion of Ccl2 and Cxcl10 in DSB-bearing neurons also reduces microglial activation in organotypic brain slice culture. In conclusion, we find that in the context of age-associated neurodegenerative disease, DSBs activate immune pathways in neurons, which in turn adopt a senescence associated secretory phenotype to elicit microglia activation.

MIAAIM provides a robust foundation for the development of computational methods to integrate multimodal, high-parameter tissue imaging data and enable downstream computational and statistical interrogation of tissue states.</p>",2021-12-21

This yielded over 150,000 direct mRNA transcript reads which were mapped to the viral genome and analysed to determine relative mRNA levels of viral genes using our in-house ORF-centric pipeline. We were also able to examine frequencies with which polycistronic readthrough mRNAs were generated and to assess the length of the polyadenylated tails for each group of transcripts. We show that there is a general but non-linear decline in gene transcript abundance across the viral genome, as predicted by the model of RSV gene transcription. However, the decline in transcript abundance is not consistent. We show that the polyadenylate tails generated by the viral polymerase are similar in length to those generated by the host cells polyadenylation machinery and broadly declined in length for most transcripts as infection progressed. Finally, we observed that the steady state abundance of transcripts with very short polyadenylate tails is much less for N, SH and G transcripts compared to NS1, NS2, P, M, F and M2 which may reflect differences in mRNA stability and/or translation rates.</p>",2021-12-23

In GPCR crystallography, inserting a fusion protein between transmembrane helices 5 and 6 is a highly successful strategy for crystallization. Although the similar strategy has the potential to broadly facilitate cryo-EM structure determination of GPCRs alone without signaling protein, the critical determinants that make this approach successful are not yet clear. Here, we address this shortcoming by exploring different fusion protein designs, which led to structures of antagonist bound A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptor at 3.4&amp;Aring resolution and unliganded Smoothened at 3.7&amp;Aring resolution.

Here we show that active pUG tails require a minimum of 11.5 repeats and adopt a quadruplex (G4)2 structure we term the pUG fold. The pUG fold differs from known G4s in that it has a left-handed backbone similar to Z-RNA, no consecutive guanosines in its sequence, and three G quartets and one U quartet stacked non-sequentially. Its biological importance is emphasized by our observations that porphyrin molecules bind to the pUG fold and inhibit both gene silencing and binding of RdRP. Moreover, specific N7-deaza RNA substitutions that do not adopt the pUG fold neither bind RdRP nor induce RNA silencing. These data define the pUG fold as a previously unrecognized RNA secondary structure motif that drives gene silencing. The pUG fold can also form internally within larger RNA molecules. Approximately 20,000 pUG-fold sequences are found in non-coding regions of human RNAs, suggesting the fold likely has biological roles beyond gene silencing.</p>",2021-12-21

Given the small size of the pairing region and the large number of mRNAs that each microRNA can control, the identification of biologically relevant targets is difficult. Since current knowledge of target recognition and repression has mainly relied on in vitro studies, we sought to determine if the interrogation of gene expression data of unperturbed tissues could yield new insight into these processes. The transcriptome-wide repression at the microRNA-mRNA canonical interaction sites (seed and 3'-supplementary region, identified by sole base complementarity) was calculated as a normalized Spearman correlation (Z-score) between the abundance of the transcripts in the PRAD-TCGA tissues (RNA-seq and small RNA-seq data of 546 samples). Using the repression values obtained we confirmed established properties or microRNA targeting efficacy, such as the preference for gene regions (3'UTR&gt;CDS&gt;5'UTR), the proportionality between repression and seed length (6mer&lt;7mer&lt;8mer) and the contribution to the repression exerted by the supplementary pairing at 13-16nt of the microRNA. Our results suggest that the 7mer-m8 seed could be more repressive than the 7mer-A1, while they have similar efficacy when they interact using the 3'-supplementary pairing. Strikingly, the 6mer+suppl sites yielded normalized Z-score of repression similar to the sole 7mer-m8 or 7mer-A1 seeds, which raise awareness of its potential biological relevance. We then used the approach to further characterize the 3'-supplementary pairing, using 39 microRNAs that hold repressive 3'-supplementary interactions. The analysis of the bridge between seed and 3'-supplementary pairing site confirmed the optimum +1 offset previously evidenced, but higher offsets appear to hold similar repressive strength. In addition, they show a low GC content at position 13-16, and base preferences that allow the selection of a candidate sequence motif. Overall, our study demonstrates that transcriptome-wide analysis of microRNA-mRNA correlations in large, matched RNA-seq and small-RNA-seq data has the power to uncover hints of microRNA targeting determinants operating in the in vivo unperturbed set. Finally, we made available a bioinformatic tool to analyze microRNA-target mRNA interactions using our approach.</p>",2021-12-23

In diverse species, mutants unable to make polyP have a wide variety of physiological defects, but the mechanisms by which this simple polyanion exerts its effects remain unclear.

We characterize the effect of polyphosphate on cytoplasmic mobility under nitrogen-starvation conditions in the opportunistic pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. Using fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking, we characterize the motion of chromosomal loci and free tracer particles in the cytoplasm. In the absence of polyP and upon starvation, we observe an increase in mobility both for chromosomal loci and for tracer particles. Tracer particles reveal that polyP also modulates the partitioning between a ′more mobile′ and a ′less mobile′ population: small particles in cells unable to make polyP are more likely to be ′mobile′ and explore more of the cytoplasm, particularly during starvation. We speculate that this larger freedom of motion may be a consequence of nucleoid decompaction, which we also observe in starved cells deficient in polyP. Our observations suggest that polyP limits cytoplasmic mobility and accessibility during nitrogen starvation, which may help to explain the pleiotropic phenotypes observed in the absence of polyP.</p>",2021-12-23

To address this problem, we have created a database called GSHC (Genome Sequences: Hot, Cold, and everything in between).

We therefore conducted a comprehensive study evaluating the impact of THs on potential drivers of telomere dynamics (growth, post-natal THs, mitochondria and oxidative stress), telomere length and medium-term survival using wild great tits as a model system. While prenatal THs did not significantly affect telomere length after hatching (<italic>i.e.</italic> day 7), they influenced postnatal telomere shortening (<italic>i.e.</italic> shorter telomeres at day 14 and the following winter) but not apparent survival.

We discuss several alternative hypotheses that may explain the contrast with our previous findings in flycatchers. Given that shorter telomeres in early life tend to be carried until adulthood and are often associated with decreased survival prospects, the effects of prenatal THs on telomeres may have long-lasting effects on senescence.</p>",2021-12-22

Here, we investigated the role of serine metabolism as a predictive marker for sensitivity to the antifolate pemetrexed in male and female NSCLC cell lines. Using [13C6] glucose tracing in NSCLC cell lines, we found that male cells generated significantly more serine from glucose than female cells. Higher serine biosynthesis was further correlated with increased sensitivity to pemetrexed in male cells only. Concordant sex differences in metabolic gene expression were evident in NSCLC and pan-cancer transcriptome datasets, suggesting a potential mechanism with wide-reaching applicability. These data were further validated by integrating antifolate drug cytotoxicity and metabolic pathway transcriptome data from pan-cancer cell lines.

Although the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (CBGT) network is implicated in this adaptation, it features a synaptic architecture comprising multiple feed-forward, reciprocal, and feedback pathways, complicating efforts to elucidate the roles of specific CBGT populations in the process of evidence accumulation during decision-making. In this paper we apply a strategic sampling approach, based on Latin hypercube sampling, to explore how CBGT network properties, including subpopulation firing rates and synaptic weights, map to parameters of a normative drift diffusion model (DDM) representing algorithmic aspects of information accumulation during decision-making. Through the application of canonical correlation analysis, we find that this relationship can be characterized in terms of three low-dimensional control ensembles impacting specific qualities of the emergent decision policy: responsiveness (associated with overall activity in corticothalamic and direct pathways), pliancy (associated largely with overall activity in components of the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia), and choice (associated with differences in direct and indirect pathways across action channels). These analyses provide key mechanistic predictions about the roles of specific CBGT network elements in shifting different aspects of decision policies.</p>",2021-12-23

We found that the most pronounced transcriptional shift occurred in the first two time points, as was reflected by both the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the average fold change. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that OMVs induce a major transcriptional shift in Arabidopsis towards immune system activation, upregulating a multitude of immune-related pathways including a variety of immune receptors and transcriptional factors. Comparing Arabidopsis response to OMVs and to single purified elicitors, revealed that while OMVs induce a similar suite of genes and pathways as single elicitors, some differential pathways activated by OMVs were detected including response to drug and apoptosis, which may indicate exposure to toxic compounds via OMV. To examine whether the observed transcriptional shift in Arabidopsis leads to an effective immune response, plants were pretreated with OMVs and then inoculated with a bacterial pathogen. OMV-mediated priming led to a significant reduction in bacterial titer in inoculated leaves two days following inoculation. Mutations in the elongation factor receptor (EFR), flagellin receptor (FLS2), or the brassinosteroid-insensitive 1–associated kinase (BAK1) receptor, did not significantly affect OMV-priming. All together these results show that OMV induce a broad transcriptional shift in Arabidopsis leading to upregulation of multiple immune pathways, and that this transcriptional change is reflected in the ability to better resist bacterial infection.</p>",2021-12-21

However, the respective roles for the PGE2 receptors EP2 and EP4 (both share same downstream signaling) in the regulation of lung ILC2 responses has yet been deciphered. Here, we find that deficiency of EP2 rather than EP4 augments IL-33-induced lung ILC2 responses and eosinophilic inflammation in vivo. In contrast, exogenous agonism of EP4 but not EP2 markedly restricts IL-33- and Alternaria alternata-induced lung ILC2 responses and eosinophilic inflammation. Mechanistically, PGE2 directly suppresses IL-33-dependent ILC2 activation through the EP2/EP4-cAMP pathway, which downregulates STAT5 and MYC pathway gene expression and ILC2 energy metabolism. Blocking glycolysis diminishes IL-33-dependent ILC2 responses in mice lacking endogenous PG synthesis but not in PG-competent mice. Together, we have defined a mechanism for optimal suppression of lung ILC2 responses by endogenous PGE2-EP2 signaling which underpins the clinical findings of defective EP2 signaling in patients with NERD. Our findings also indicate that exogenously targeting the PGE2-EP4-cAMP and energy metabolic pathways may provide novel opportunities for treating ILC2-initiated lung inflammation in asthma and NERD.</p>",2021-12-24

The resulting position data allowed us to construct both individual home range kernels and a population-level utilization distribution. Our results reveal a dense predatory blanket that outdoor cats drape over and beyond the urban landscape. It is this population-level intensity surface - the “catscape” - that potential prey have to navigate. There were almost no gaps in the catscape within our residential study area and therefore few terrestrial refuges from potential cat predation. However, cats spent on average 79% of their outdoor time within 50 meters to their owner’s home, which suggests that the primary impact is local and most acute for wildlife in the vicinity to homes with cats.

Each apoptotic signalling pathway involves a specific initiator caspase, upstream of the pathway regulation, which finally converges to common executioner caspases. Intrinsic apoptosis, previously known as the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, is often considered as ancestral and evolutionary conserved among animals. First identified in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, intrinsic apoptosis was next characterised in fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and mammals. Intrinsic apoptosis depends on the key initiator caspase-9 (named Ced-3 and Dronc in Caenorhabditis and Drosophila, respectively), the activator Apaf-1 and the Bcl-2 multigenic family. Many functional studies have led to a deep characterisation of intrinsic apoptosis based on those classical models. Nevertheless, the biochemical role of mitochondria, the pivotal function of cytochrome c and the modality of caspases activation remain highly heterogeneous and hide profound molecular divergences among apoptotic pathways in animals. Independent of functional approaches, the phylogenetic history of the signal transduction actors, mostly the caspase family, is the Rosetta Stone to shed light on intrinsic apoptosis evolution. Here, after exhaustive research on CARD-caspases, we demonstrate by phylogenetic analysis that the caspase-9, the fundamental key of intrinsic apoptosis, is deuterostomes-specific, while it is the caspase-2 which is ancestral and common to bilaterians. Our analysis of Bcl-2 family and Apaf-1 confirm the high heterogeneity in apoptotic pathways elaboration in animals.

The rate and efficiency of parasite replication is fundamentally important to malarial disease, which tends to be severe in hosts with high parasite loads. Here, we have studied for the first time the dynamics of schizogony in two human malaria parasite species, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium knowlesi</italic>. These differ in their cell-cycle length, the number of progeny produced and the genome composition, among other factors.

In both species, gaps become longer as schizogony progresses, whereas each period of active replication grows shorter. In both species there is also extreme variability between individual cells, with some schizonts producing many more nuclei than others, and some individual nuclei arresting their replication for many hours while adjacent nuclei continue to replicate. The efficiency of schizogony is probably influenced by a complex set of factors in both the parasite and its host cell.</p>",2021-12-21

AD's complex pathobiology consists of extracellular β-amyloid deposition and intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau. Comprehensive mutational analyses can generate a wealth of knowledge about protein properties and enable crucial insights into molecular mechanisms of disease. Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) has enabled multiplexed measurement of mutational effects on protein properties, including kinematics and self-organization, with unprecedented resolution. However, potential bottlenecks of DMS characterization include experimental design, data quality, and the depth of mutational coverage. Here, we apply Deep Learning to comprehensively model the mutational effect of the AD-associated peptide Aβ<sub>42</sub> on aggregation-related biochemical traits from DMS measurements. Among tested neural network architectures, Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are found to be the most cost-effective models with robust high performance even under insufficiently-sampled DMS studies. While sequence features are essential for satisfactory prediction from neural networks, geometric-structural features further enhance the prediction performance. Notably, we demonstrate how mechanistic insights into phenotype may be extracted from the neural networks themselves suitably designed. This methodological benefit is particularly relevant for biochemical systems displaying a strong coupling between structure and phenotype such as the conformation of Aβ<sub>42</sub> aggregate and nucleation, as shown here using a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) developed from the protein atomic structure input. In addition to accurate imputation of missing values (which here ranged up to 55% of all phenotype values at key residues), the mutationally-defined nucleation phenotype generated from a GCN shows improved resolution for identifying known disease-causing mutations relative to the original DMS phenotype. Our study suggests that neural network derived sequence-phenotype mapping can be exploited not only to provide direct support for protein engineering or genome editing but also to facilitate therapeutic design with the gained perspectives from biological modeling.</p>",2021-12-21

We found that medium-supplementation with FBP, but not with other glycolytic metabolites, such as fructose 6-phosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate, impaired mesoderm segmentation. To genetically manipulate glycolytic flux and FBP levels, we generated a mouse model enabling the conditional overexpression of dominant active, cytoplasmic Pfkfb3 (cytoPfkfb3).

CDI causes hundreds of thousands of cases of severe, often recurrent diarrhea and colitis in the United States annually and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current therapies for preventing recurrent CDI are only partially successful, and there are no options available to prevent initial bouts of CDI in at-risk populations. Almost all antibody therapies have been developed and administered as monotherapies. Antibody cocktails are relatively rare even though they have the potential to greatly increase efficacy. One reason for this is our limited understanding of how antibody interactions can enhance potency, which makes it difficult to identify and develop antibodies that can be assembled into optimally effective cocktails. In contrast to the view that antibody synergies depend on unusual instances of cooperativity or allostery, we show that synergistic efficacy requires nothing more than that the antibodies bind independently to distinct epitopes on a common target. Therefore, synergy may be achieved much more readily than is generally appreciated. Due to synergy the LMN-201 antibody cocktail, which targets the <italic>C. difficile</italic> exotoxin B (TcdB), is 300- to 3000-fold more potent at neutralizing the most clinically prevalent TcdB toxin types than bezlotoxumab, the only monoclonal antibody currently approved for treatment or prevention of CDI. The efficacy of LMN-201 is further enhanced by inclusion of a phage-derived endolysin that destroys the C. difficile bacterium, and which therefore has a complementary mechanism of action to the antibody cocktail. These observations may serve as a paradigm for the development of high potency biologic cocktails against targets that have proven challenging for single-agent therapies.</p>",2021-12-22

Sera of 3 months after double BNT162b2 vaccination exhibit approximately 18-fold lower neutralization titers against Omicron. Convalescent sera from Alpha and Delta patients allow similar levels of breakthrough by Omicron. However, some Delta patients have relatively preserved neutralization efficacy, comparable to 3-month double BNT162b2 vaccination.

The severity of disease may be in part because MERS-CoV is adept at antagonizing early innate immune pathways – interferon (IFN) production and signaling, protein kinase R (PKR), and oligoadenylate synthetase ribonuclease L (OAS/RNase L) – generated in response to viral double-stranded (ds)RNA generated during genome replication. This is in contrast to SARS-CoV-2, which we recently reported activates PKR and RNase L and to some extent, IFN signaling. We previously found that MERS-CoV accessory proteins NS4a (dsRNA binding protein) and NS4b (phosphodiesterase) could weakly suppress these pathways, but ablation of each had minimal effect on virus replication. Here we investigated the antagonist effects of the conserved coronavirus endoribonuclease (EndoU), in combination with NS4a or NS4b. Inactivation of EndoU catalytic activity alone in a recombinant MERS-CoV caused little if any effect on activation of the innate immune pathways during infection. However, infection with recombinant viruses containing combined mutations with inactivation of EndoU and deletion of NS4a or inactivation of the NS4b phosphodiesterase promoted robust activation of the dsRNA-induced innate immune pathways. This resulted in ten-fold attenuation of replication in human lung derived A549 and primary nasal cells. Furthermore, replication of these recombinant viruses could be rescued to the level of WT MERS-CoV by knockout of host immune mediators MAVS, PKR, or RNase L.

In indirect surveying, which depends largely upon artefacts of behavior, likelihood to encounter indirect signs of a species is derived from both artefact production and decay, although variability in behaviors relevant to artefact abundance is rarely considered in population estimation. Here we demonstrate how ignoring behavioral variability contributes to overestimation of population size of an endangered ape endemic to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the bonobo (<italic>Pan paniscus</italic>). Commonly, a single metric of sign production (i.e., nest construction) is used to estimate bonobo density, assumed to be representative of bonobo nest behavior across all contexts. We estimated nest construction rates from three bonobo groups within the Kokolopori Bonobo Reserve and found that nest construction rates in bonobos to be highly variable across populations as well as seasonal within populations. Failure to account for behavioral variability in nest construction leads to potentially severe degradation in accuracy of bonobo population estimates of abundance, accounting for a likely overestimation of bonobo numbers by 34%, and in the worst cases as high as 80% overestimation. Using bonobo nesting as an example, we demonstrate that failure to account for inter- and intra-population behavioral variation compromises our ability to monitor population change or reliably compare contributors to population decline or persistence. We argue that variation in sign production is but one of several potential ways that behavioral variability can affect conservation monitoring, should be measured across contexts whenever possible, and must be considered in population estimation confidence intervals. With increasing attention to behavioral variability as a potential tool for conservation, conservationists must also account for the impact that behavioral variability across time, space, individuals, and populations can play upon precision and accuracy of wildlife population estimation.</p>",2021-12-23

Understanding the responses of species and ecosystem to fire can help to develop predictive models and inform fire management decisions. Despite their massive diversity and abundance, relatively little is known about the impacts of fire on invertebrates. Spiders are a diverse and ubiquitous group, with variation in ecological, behavioural and life history traits, and can offer important insights into the impacts of fire on invertebrates and whether these depend on environmental factors, phylogenetic history, or species traits. We conducted phylogenetic comparative analyses of published data from studies investigating the impacts of fire on spiders. We investigated whether fire affects family level abundance and whether this effect depends on ecologically relevant traits or site-specific factors (vegetation, latitude, fire type, time since fire). We found that time since fire had a significant effect on the abundance of some spider families (Lycosidae, Linyphiidae, Agelenidae), and within forest vegetation types. There was no relationship between family level traits and response to fire, suggesting that a trait-based approach does not increase predictive power in this group at this taxonomic level. Overall, it is difficult to make broad generalisations about the impacts of fire on spider abundance due to variation in site- and fire-specific factors. We did, however, find evidence that short fire intervals may be a threat to some spider families, and in forest ecosystems, where abundance initially decreased after fire, which may have important implications for fire management strategies. Finally, we show that analyses of published data can be used to detect broad scale ecological patterns and provide an alternative to traditional meta-analytical approaches.</p>",2021-12-21

Notably underexplored are the high energetic costs of developing brains, and thus the possible role of parental provisioning in the evolution of adult brain size. We explore this idea in birds, which show considerable variation in both socio-ecological traits and the energy transfer from parents to offspring. Comparative analyses of 1,176 bird species show that the combination of adult body mass, mode of development at hatching, relative egg mass, and the time spent provisioning the young in combination strongly predict relative brain size across species. Adding adult eco- and socio-cognitive predictors only marginally adds explanatory value. We therefore conclude that parental provisioning enabled bird species to evolve into skill-intensive niches, reducing interspecific competition and consequently promoting survival prospects and population stability. Critically, parental provisioning also explains why precocial bird species have smaller brains than altricial ones. Finally, these results suggest that the cognitive adaptations that provide the behavioral flexibility to improve reproductive success and survival are intrinsically linked to successful parental provisioning. Our findings also suggest that the traditionally assessed cognitive abilities may not predict relative brain size.</p><sec><title>Significance statement</title><p>Species vary substantially in their brain size, and the idea that larger-brained species are those with a complex social life or enhanced technological skills has generated much interest.

Comparative analyses of a large sample of bird species show that parental provisioning strongly predicts relative brain size across species, swamping the effects of previously considered social or technological cognitive abilities.

We next used the model to compare the responsiveness of the network to external stimuli, and found that when NMDA channnels are blocked an increase of Gamma power is observed altogether with an increase of network responsiveness. However, this responsiveness increase applies not only to gamma states, but also to synchronous states with no apparent gamma.

This package compiles most of the information measures currently available: mutual information, conditional mutual information, interaction information, partial information decomposition and part mutual information. The first estimator is used to infer bivariate networks while the last four estimators are dedicated to analysis of trivariate networks. The base installation of this turn-key package allows users to approach these information measures out of the box.

However, it also serves as precursor for more deleterious species such as the hydroxyl anion or peroxynitrite and therefore, cellular defense mechanisms for superoxide neutralization have evolved. In addition to the soluble proteins superoxide dismutase and superoxide reductase, recently the membrane embedded diheme cytochrome b561 (CybB) from E. coli has been proposed to act as a superoxide:quinone oxidoreductase. Here, we confirm superoxide and cellular ubiquinones or menaquinones as natural substrates and show that quinone binding to the enzyme accelerates the reaction with superoxide. The reactivity of the substrates is in accordance with the here determined midpoint potential of the two b hemes (+48 and -23 mV / NHE). Our data suggest that the enzyme can work near the diffusion limit in the forward direction and can also catalyse the reverse reaction efficiently under physiological conditions.

To reduce spurious associations or improve statistical power, about 80% of GWASs arbitrarily adjusted for demographic and clinical covariates. However, adjustment strategies in GWASs have not achieved consistent conclusions. Given the initial aim of GWAS that is to identify the causal association between a specific causal single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and disease trait, we summarized all complex relationships of the target SNP, covariate and disease trait into 15 causal diagrams according to various roles of the covariate. Following each causal diagram, we conducted a series of theoretical justifications and statistical simulations. Our results demonstrate that it is unadvisable to adjust for any demographic or clinical covariates. We illustrate our point by applying GWASs for body mass index (BMI) and breast cancer, including adjusting and non-adjusting for age and smoking status. Genetic effects and P values might vary across different strategies. Instead, adjustments for SNPs (G') should be strongly recommended when G' are in linkage disequilibrium with the target SNP, and correlated with disease trait conditional on the target SNP. Specifically, adjustment for such G' can block all the confounding paths between the target SNP and disease trait, and avoid over-adjusting for colliders or intermediaries.</p>",2021-12-23

In this model, confidence reflects a subject’s estimate of the reliability of their decision. The quality of this estimate is limited by the subject’s uncertainty about the uncertainty of the variable that informs their decision (“meta-uncertainty”).

Alpha-synuclein within Lewy pathology is aggregated into protease resistant filamentous structures and is predominantly phosphorylated at serine 129 (PSER129).  Lewy pathology has been hypothesized to spread throughout the nervous system as the disease progresses. Cross-sectional studies have shown the olfactory bulb and olfactory tract consistently bare LP for common synucleinopathies, making these structures likely starting points for the spreading process, and thus disease. Here we examined the distribution of PSER129 in non-diseased brain. To do this we used a sensitive tyramide signal amplification (TSA) technique to detect low abundance endogenous PSER129 under ideal antibody binding conditions. In wild-type non-diseased mice, PSER129 was detected in the olfactory bulb and several brain regions of the olfactory cortex across the neuroaxis (i.e., olfactory bulb to brain stem). PSER129 was particularly apparent in the mitral cell layer and the outer plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb where it was observed as cytosolic/nuclear puncta or fibers, respectively. PSER129 immunoreactivity in the healthy olfactory bulb was abolished by pretreatment of the tissue with proteinase K, pre-absorption of the primary antibody against the purified PSER129 peptide fragment, or the omission of the PSER129 antibody. Furthermore, PSER129 immunoreactivity was not observed in any brain region of alpha-synuclein knockout mice. Dual labeling for the PSER129 and the mitral cell marker TBX21 showed that PSER129 positive structures of the healthy OB were found in mitral cells. We found evidence of the same PSER129 positive structures in the olfactory bulb of non-diseased rats, non-human primates, healthy humans, but not individuals diagnosed with PD. Results suggest biological pathways responsible for alpha-synuclein phosphorylation are constitutively active in OB mitral cells and alpha-synuclein in these cells may be predisposed to pathological aggregation. Pathological seeds originating in mitral cells may act as a source for alpha-synuclein spread competent assemblies that spreads throughout the brain via fibers of the olfactory tract. Future studies should investigate the normal function of alpha-synuclein in the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, which may give insight into synucleinopathy disease origins.</p>",2021-12-23

There is a pressing need for computational tools to enable the detection of genes that are differentially expressed across tissue context for cell types of interest. However, changes in cell type composition across space and the fact that measurement units often detect transcripts from more than one cell type introduce complex statistical challenges. Here, we introduce a statistical method, Robust Cell Type Differential Expression (RCTDE), that estimates cell type-specific patterns of differential gene expression while accounting for localization of other cell types. By using general log-linear models, we provide a unified framework for defining and identifying gene expression changes for a wide-range of relevant contexts: changes due to pathology, anatomical regions, physical proximity to specific cell types, and cellular microenvironment. Furthermore, our approach enables statistical inference across multiple samples and replicates when such data is available. We demonstrate, through simulations and validation experiments on Slide-seq and MERFISH datasets, that our approach accurately identifies cell type-specific differential gene expression and provides valid uncertainty quantification. Lastly, we apply our method to characterize spatially-localized tissue changes in the context of disease. In an Alzheimer's mouse model Slide-seq dataset, we identify plaque-dependent patterns of cellular immune activity. We also find a putative interaction between tumor cells and myeloid immune cells in a Slide-seq tumor dataset.

Much less understood is the role that epigenetic and epi-transcriptional reprogramming plays in the process of neuronal differentiation and maturation. To depict the whole landscape of transcriptomics and epigenetic changes during neuronal differentiation and maturation, we differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and performed RNA sequencing on differentiated and undifferentiated cells. 728 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enriched in synaptic signaling and cell morphogenesis pathways were observed. Moreover, transcriptome-wide mRNA stability profiling revealed that genes with altered stability were exceptionally enriched for redox homeostasis pathways. Mature neurons are known to be highly sensitive to oxidative stress, which is crucial in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disease. Our results suggest that this heightened sensitivity is regulated at the mRNA stability level (i.e., epigenetic) rather than at the transcriptional level. Alternative splicing analysis revealed the exon skipping and alternative mRNA isoforms enriched for morphogenesis related pathway. Alternatively, alternative 5 and 3 prime splicing site, intron retention and mutually exclusive exon events exclusively clustered in the translation and translation initiation pathways, suggesting the potential effect of alternative splicing on translation following neuronal maturation. Splice motif analysis revealed enriched motifs for RBPs that regulate various splice types and can be further correlated to distinct phenotypical changes during neuronal differentiation and maturation. Here we present an extensive exploration of the transcriptional and epigenetic changes and their potential association with the process of neuronal differentiation, providing a new insight into understanding the molecular mechanism of neuronal function and behavior.</p>",2021-12-25

The striatum pyramidal (SP) of hippocampal CA1 consists of superficial and deep sublayers, however, it is not well understood how early- and late-born pyramidal neurons position to two sublayers postnatally. Here we show that neuronal primary cilia emerge after CA1 pyramidal cells have reached SP, but before final neuronal positioning. The axonemes of primary cilia of early-born neurons point to the stratum oriens (SO), whereas late-born neuronal cilia orient toward the stratum radiatum (SR), reflecting an inside-out lamination pattern. Neuronal primary cilia in SP undergo marked changes in morphology and orientation from postnatal day 5 (P5) to P14, concurrent with pyramidal cell positioning to the deep and superficial sublayers and with neuronal maturation. Transgenic overexpression of Arl13B, a protein regulating ciliogenesis, not only elongates primary cilia and promotes earlier cilia protrusion, but also affects centriole positioning and cilia orientation in SP. The centrioles of late-born neurons migrate excessively to cluster at SP bottom before primary cilia protrusion and a reverse movement back to the main SP. Similarly, this “pull-back” movement of centriole/cilia is also identified on late-born cortical pyramidal neurons, although early- and late-born cortical neurons display the same cilia orientation. Together, this study provides the first evidence demonstrating that late-born pyramidal neurons exhibit a reverse movement for cell positioning, and primary cilia regulate pyramidal neuronal positioning to the deep and superficial sublayers in the hippocampus.</p>",2021-12-21

We found that acetylcholine dynamics were spatially homogenous and directly attributable to whisker motion and licking, rather than sensory cues or reward delivery. As task performance improved across training, acetylcholine release to the first lick in a trial became dramatically and specifically potentiated, paralleling the emergence of a choice-signalling basis for this motor action.

Using these stimuli, we show that this species responds to objects as small as 1.06° in its visual field. We also show that C. luhuanus responds to Michelson contrasts of 0.07, a low contrast sensitivity between object and background. The defensive withdrawal response elicited by visual stimuli of such small angular size and low contrast suggests that conch snails may use spatial vision for the early detection of potential predators. We support these findings with morphological estimations of spatial resolution of 1.04 ± 0.14°. These anatomical data therefore agree with the behavioural measures and highlight the benefits of integrating morphological and behavioural approaches in animal vision studies. Furthermore, using contemporary imaging techniques including serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM), in conjunction with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we found that C. luhuanus have more complex retinas, in terms of cell type diversity, than previous studies of the group have discovered using TEM alone.

These activations were uncovered by using the “EEG energy” (power 2) as the BOLD regressor and were missed if conventional analysis with the EEG signal itself were to be used, in agreement with theoretical predictions for EEG and BOLD relations. No significant positive correlations were found with higher powers of EEG (powers 3 or 4) pointing to specificity and sufficiency of EEG energy as the main correlate of the BOLD response.

Unexpectedly, we identified widespread genetic potential for secondary metabolite biosynthesis across Chlamydiae, which may represent an explored reservoir of novel natural products.

Pasricha'}, {'name': 'Arun K. Upadhayaya'}]","<p>In the present study, three basic aspects related to COVID-19 are presented. 
(a) The occurrence of coronavirus infection is analyzed statistically as number of coronaviruses infected alveolar cells compared to normal alveolar cells in human lungs. The mole concept is used to estimate the number of normal alveolar cells per human lung. The number of coronavirus infections in infected alveolar cells is estimated from the published Lower Respiratory Tract (LRT) load data. The Poisson probability distribution is aptly applied to imply the incubation period of the coronavirus infection to be within day-3 to day-7, with the cumulative probability of 75%. The incubation period within day-0 to day-10 has a cumulative probability of 98%. It implies a 10-day quarantine to isolate an uninfected individual as a precautionary measure. 
(b) Three vaccines to combat COVID-19, which adopt distinct paradigms while preparing them, are analyzed. These are Moderna's mRNA-1273, Oxford-AstraZeneca's ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Bharat BioTech's COVAXIN. The mole concept is used to estimate the antigen mass density per dose of each of these vaccines as 10, 0.1 and 1 (g per cubic-cm), respectively. The vaccines are deemed to be compatible to neutralize the infection.
(c) A statistical analysis is performed of the Moderna's mRNA-1273 vaccine efficacy of 94.1% and Oxford's ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine efficacy of 62.1% in terms of groups of volunteers testing negative to vaccine by chance. In the Moderna vaccination testing scenario, since the probability of negative response of vaccine is small, the Poisson probability distribution for 95% cumulative probability is used to describe the vaccination testing in 300 samples of 47 volunteers each. Thus, 87% of samples have average group of 3 volunteers testing negative to vaccine. About 6% of samples have all volunteers testing positive to vaccine. In the Oxford vaccination testing scenario, since the probability of negative response of vaccine is finite, the Gaussian probability distribution for 95% probability is used to describe the vaccination testing in 75 samples of 120 volunteers each. Thus, 68% of samples have average group of 45 volunteers testing negative to vaccine. No sample has all volunteers testing positive to vaccine. A vaccine, irrespective of its efficacy being high or low, is necessary for mass immunization.</p>",2021-12-24

A solution that would overcome these disadvantages is desirable. In this study a commercially available knit polyester fleece fabric was selected as the filter material, and a total of 25 filters of different areas and thicknesses were prepared. Then, the size-resolved filtration efficiency (40–400 nm) and pressure drop were evaluated at a volumetric flow rate of 95 L/min. We showed the excellent synergistic effect of expanding the filtration area and increasing the number of filtering layers on the filtration efficiency; a filter cartridge with 8 layers of knit polyester fabric with a surface area of 900 cm<sup>2</sup> and sized 25 × 14 × 8 cm achieved filtration efficiencies of 98 % at 95 L/min and 99.5 % at 30 L/min. The assembled filter kit consists of a filter cartridge (14 Pa) carried in a small backpack connected to a half mask with a total pressure drop of 84 Pa at 95 L/min. In addition, it is reusable, and the filter material can be regenerated at least ten times by simple methods, such as boiling. We have demonstrated a novel approach for creating high-quality and easy-to-breathe-through respiratory protective equipment that reduces operating costs and is a green solution because it is easy to regenerate.</p>",2021-12-21

Self-powered artificial cells capable of reversible deformation are developed by encapsulating living mitochondria, actin proteins, and methylcellulose. Upon the addition of pyruvate molecules, the mitochondria produce ATP molecules as energy sources to trigger the polymerization of actin. ATP molecules were produced by mitochondria (2.76×10<sup>10</sup>/ml) with the concentrations of 35.8±3.2 µM, 158.2±19.3 µM and 200.7±20.1 μM by adding pyruvate molecules with the concentration of 3 μM, 12 μM and 21 μM, respectively. The reversible deformation of artificial cells is experienced with spindle shape resulting from the polymerization of actins to form filaments adjacent to the lipid bilayer, subsequently back to spherical shape resulting from the depolymerization of actin filaments upon laser irradiations. The linear colonies composed of these artificial cells exhibit collective contraction and relaxation behavior to mimic muscle tissues. At the stage of maximum contraction, the long axis of each GUV is in parallel to each other. All colonies are synchronized in the contraction phase.

Buchholz'}, {'name': 'Gregor F.P. Schuhknecht'}]","<p>To compute spiking responses, neurons integrate inputs from thousands of synapses whose strengths span an order of magnitude. Intriguingly, in mouse neocortex, the small minority of 'strong' synapses is found predominantly between similarly tuned cells, suggesting they are the synapses that determine a neuron's spike output. This raises the question of how other computational primitives, such as 'background' activity from the majority of synapses, which are 'weak', short-term plasticity, and temporal synchrony contribute to spiking. First, we combined extracellular stimulation and whole-cell recordings in mouse barrel cortex to map the distribution of excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitudes and paired-pulse ratios of excitatory synaptic connections converging onto individual layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons. While generally net short-term plasticity was weak, connections with EPSPs &gt; 2 mV displayed pronounced paired-pulse depression. EPSP amplitudes and paired-pulse ratios of connections converging onto the same neurons spanned the full range observed across L2/3 and there was no indication that strong synapses nor those with particular short-term plasticity properties were associated with particular cells, which critically constrains theoretical models of cortical filtering. To investigate how different computational primitives of synaptic information processing interact to shape spiking, we developed a computational model of a pyramidal neuron in the rodent L2/3 circuitry: firing rates and pairwise correlations of presynaptic inputs were constrained by in vivo observations, while synaptic strength and short-term plasticity were set based on our experimental data. Importantly, we found that the ability of strong inputs to evoke spiking critically depended on their high temporal synchrony and high firing rates observed in vivo and on synaptic background activity - and not primarily on synaptic strength, which in turn further enhanced information transfer. Depression of strong synapses was critical for maintaining a neuron's responsivity and prevented runaway excitation. Our results provide a holistic framework of how cortical neurons exploit complex synergies between temporal coding, synaptic properties, and noise in order to transform synaptic inputs into output firing.</p>",2021-12-23

The most well studied neurobiological consequences of exercise are those which underlie exercise-induced improvements in hippocampal memory, including the expression and regulation of the neurotrophic factor Bdnf. Whether aerobic exercise taking place during early-life periods of postnatal brain maturation has similar impacts on gene expression and its regulation remains to be investigated. Using unbiased next-generation sequencing we characterize gene expression programs and their regulation by specific, memory-associated histone modifications during juvenile-adolescent voluntary exercise (ELE). Traditional transcriptomic and epigenomic sequencing approaches have either used heterogeneous cell populations from whole tissue homogenates or flow cytometry for single cell isolation to distinguish cell types / subtypes. These methods fall short in providing cell-type specificity without compromising sequencing depth or procedure-induced changes to cellular phenotype. In this study, we use simultaneous isolation of translating mRNA and nuclear chromatin from a neuron-enriched cell population to more accurately pair ELE-induced changes in gene expression with epigenetic modifications. We employ a line of transgenic mice expressing the NuTRAP (Nuclear Tagging and Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification) cassette under the Emx1 promoter allowing for brain cell-type specificity. We then developed a technique that combines nuclear isolation using Isolation of Nuclei TAgged in Specific Cell Types (INTACT) with Translating Ribosomal Affinity Purification (TRAP) methods to determine cell type-specific epigenetic modifications influencing gene expression programs from a population of Emx1 expressing hippocampal neurons. Data from RNA-seq and CUT&amp;RUN-seq were coupled to evaluate histone modifications influencing the expression of translating mRNA in neurons after early-life exercise (ELE). We also performed separate INTACT and TRAP isolations for validation of our protocol and demonstrate similar molecular functions and biological processes implicated by gene ontology (GO) analysis. Finally, as prior studies use tissue from opposite brain hemispheres to pair transcriptomic and epigenomic data from the same rodent, we take a bioinformatics approach to compare hemispheric differences in gene expression programs and histone modifications altered by by ELE. Our data reveal transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of ELE exposure and identify novel candidate gene-histone modification interactions for further investigation.

To this end, we attempted to design an assay that reduces the frequency of positive test results from individuals who do not shed culturable virus.

The effort and cost in producing DNA barcode sequence data for large numbers of fungal specimens can be prohibitive. This study applies a modified metabarcoding approach that provides a labor and cost-effective solution for sequencing the fungal DNA barcode from hundreds of specimens at once. Methods: A two-step PCR approach uses nested barcoded primers to nrITS2 sequence data. We applied this to 766 macrofungal specimens that represent a broad taxonomic sampling of the Dikarya, of which 382 Lactarius specimens are used to identify molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) through a phylogenetic approach. Scripts in Python and R were used to organize sequence data and execute packages CutAdapt and DADA2 were used for primer removal and assessing sequence quality. Sequences were compared to NCBI and UNITE databases and Sanger-produced sequences. Results: Specimen taxonomic identities from nrITS2 sequence data are &gt;90% accurate across all specimens sampled. Phylogenetic analysis of Lactarius sequences identified 20 MOTUs. Discussion: The results demonstrate the capacity of these methods to produce nrITS2 sequences from large numbers of fungarium specimens. This provides an opportunity to more effectively use fungarium collections in advancing fungal diversity identification and documentation.</p>",2021-12-23

Light-harvesting complexes increase the absorption cross-section of these photosystems. Furthermore, these complexes play a central role in photoprotection by dissipating the excess of absorbed light energy in an inducible and regulated fashion. In higher plants, the main light-harvesting complex is the trimeric LHCII. In this work, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout the five genes encoding LHCB1, which is the major component of the trimeric LHCII. In absence of LHCB1 the accumulation of the other LHCII isoforms was only slightly increased, thereby resulting in chlorophyll loss leading to a pale green phenotype and growth delay. Photosystem II absorption cross-section was smaller while photosystem I absorption cross-section was unaffected. This altered the chlorophyll repartition between the two photosystems, favoring photosystem I excitation. The equilibrium of the photosynthetic electron transport was partially maintained by a lower photosystem I over photosystem II reaction center ratio and by the dephosphorylation of LHCII and photosystem II. Loss of LHCB1 altered the thylakoid structure, with less membrane layers per grana stack and reduced grana width. Stable LHCB1 knock out lines allow characterizing the role of this protein in light harvesting and acclimation and pave the way for future in vivo mutational analyses of LHCII.</p>",2021-12-23

Transmission and production are often discussed interchangeably or modeled separately, yet to date, no study has accounted for both processes and explored their interaction. We present a generative model that integrates the two in order to explore how variation in either might shape cultural diffusion dynamics. Agents make behavioural choices that change as they learn from their behavioural productions. Their repertoires also change over time, and the social transmission of behaviours depends on their frequency. We diffuse a novel behaviour through social networks across a large parameter space to demonstrate how accounting for both transmission and production reveals dependencies between individual-level behavioural production rules and population-level diffusion dynamics. We then investigate how such dependencies might affect the performance of two commonly used inferential models for social learning; Network-based Diffusion Analysis (NBDA), and Experienced Weighted Attraction models (EWA). By clarifying the distinction between acquisition and usage, we illuminate often-overlooked theoretical differences between social learning and social influence.

Soil microbiota may for example be investigated in relation to biodiversity research or as a tool in forensic investigations.

After sampling, the taxonomic composition of soil biotic communities may change. In order to minimize community changes after sampling, it is desirable to reduce biological activity, e.g. by freezing immediately after sampling. However, this may be impossible due to remoteness of study sites or, in forensic cases, where soil has been attached to a questioned item for protracted periods of time.

Here we investigated the effect of storage duration and conditions on the assessment of the soil biota with eDNA metabarcoding. We extracted eDNA from freshly collected soil samples and again from the same samples after storage under contrasting temperature conditions. We used five different primer sets targeting bacteria, fungi, protists (cercozoans), general eukaryotes, and plants. For these groups, we quantified differences in richness, evenness and community composition. Subsequently, we tested whether we could correctly infer habitat type and original sample identity after storage using a large reference dataset.

We found increased community composition differences with extended storage time and with higher storage temperature. However, for samples stored less than 28 days at a maximum of 20 C, changes were generally insignificant. Classification models could successfully assign most stored samples to their exact location of origin and correct habitat type even after weeks of storage. Even samples showing larger compositional changes generally retained the original sample as the best match (relative similarity).

Our results show that for most biodiversity and forensic applications, storage of samples for days and even several weeks may not be a problem, if storage temperature does not exceed 20 C. Even after suboptimal storage conditions, significant patterns can be reproduced.</p>",2021-12-23

GUVs are also of interest for the functional investigation of membrane proteins that carry out many key cellular functions. A major hurdle to a wider application of GUVs in this field is the diversity of existing protocols that are optimized for individual proteins. Here, we compare PVA assisted and electroformation techniques for GUV formation under physiologically relevant conditions, and analyze the effect of immobilization on vesicle structure and membrane tightness towards small substrates and protons. There, differences in terms of yield, size, and leakage of GUVs produced by PVA assisted swelling and electroformation were found, dependent on salt and buffer composition.

According to the clustering, cell representations are updated so that each cell will be pulled toward centres of its assigned cluster and similar clusters, while cells are separated to keep distances between clusters. This is accomplished through jointly optimizing the carefully designed clustering and autoencoder loss functions. This merging process continues until convergence.

We show this definition is linked to extrema counting and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). We explore the mathematics of our definition and link it to results from analytic number theory. This naturally leads to us to define two classes of harmonic structures, termed strong and weak, with different extrema behaviour. We validate our framework using both simulations and real data.

This work focuses on the spread of COVID-19 between June and November 2020 in Greater Buenos Aires.

Using a two-phase-agar system, we characterized Arabidopsis thaliana responses to low and high mechanical impedance at three root penetration stages. We found that seedlings whose roots fail to penetrate agar barriers show drastic changes in shoot and root morphology, while those capable of penetrating have only minor morphological effects. The assessment of 21 Arabidopsis accessions revealed that primary root penetrability (PRP) varies widely among accessions. To search for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated to root system penetrability, we evaluated a recombinant inbred population (RIL) derived from Landsberg erecta (Ler-0, with a high PRP) and Shahdara (Sha, with a low PRP) accessions. QTL analysis revealed a major-effect QTL localized in chromosome 3 (q-RPI3), which accounted for 29.98% (LOD = 8.82) of the total phenotypic variation. Employing an introgression line (IL-321), with a homozygous q-RPI3 region from Sha in the Ler-0 genetic background, we demonstrated that q-RPI3 plays a crucial role in root penetrability.

Most of our findings corroborate those very few previous studies that also make a distinction between slow and fast spindles in their developmental analysis. We find spindle frequency increasing with age, although spindle density change is not obvious in our study. We confirm the declining tendencies for amplitude and duration, although within narrower, more specific age-windows than previously. Spindle frequency seems to be higher in females in the oldest age-group.

Beyond the characteristics of a lesion, such as its etiology, size or location, LNM has shown that common symptoms in patients after injury may reflect the effects of their lesions on the same circuits, thereby linking symptoms to specific brain networks. Here, we extend LNM to its multimodal form, using a combination of functional and structural connectivity maps drawn from data from 1000 healthy participants in the Human Connectome Project. We applied the multimodal LNM to a cohort of 54 stroke patients with the aim of predicting sensorimotor behavior, as assessed through a combination of motor and sensory tests. Test scores were predicted using a Canonical Correlation Analysis with multimodal brain maps as independent variables, and cross-validation strategies were employed to overcome overfitting. The results obtained led us to draw three conclusions. First, the multimodal analysis reveals how functional connectivity maps contribute more than structural connectivity maps in the optimal prediction of sensorimotor behavior. Second, the maximal association solution between the behavioral outcome and multimodal lesion connectivity maps suggests an equal contribution of sensory and motor coefficients, in contrast to the unimodal analyses where the sensory contribution dominates in both structural and functional maps. Finally, when looking at each modality individually, the performance of the structural connectivity maps strongly depends on whether sensorimotor performance was corrected for lesion size, thereby eliminating the effect of larger lesions that produce more severe sensorimotor dysfunction. By contrast, the maps of functional connectivity performed similarly irrespective of any correction for lesion size. Overall, these results support the extension of LNM to its multimodal form, highlighting the synergistic and additive nature of different types of imaging modalities, and the influence of their corresponding brain networks on behavioral performance after acquired brain injury.</p>",2021-12-23

Rhebergen'}, {'name': 'Maarten Wijstma'}, {'name': 'Isabel M. Smallegange'}]","<p>Condition-dependent expression of alternative male morphs evolves when males of different sizes experience different mating niches, requiring different morphologies. Such mating niche differentiation can be due to competitive asymmetry between large and small males in contests over mating opportunities. Here, we tested the hypothesis that aggressive interactions among males cause size-structured mating niches in an acarid mite with condition-dependent male polyphenism: the bulb mite Rhizoglyphus robini. In this species, large males mature as armed fighters with enlarged legs, and small males as scramblers without modified legs. We staged experimental dyadic contests over a mating opportunity between either a pair of fighter males, or a fighter and a scrambler male. We predicted that the larger male would have a higher likelihood of mating first in contests among fighters, that the fighter male would have a higher likelihood of mating first in fighter-scrambler contests, that fighters would have a higher likelihood of interrupting ongoing copulations if they are larger than their mating rival, and that copulations in the presence of a fighter rival therefore last shorter than copulations with a scrambler rival present. We found that in contests among fighters, the larger male had a higher probability of mating first. In contests among a fighter and scrambler, the fighter male was more likely to mate first regardless of the body size difference between the contestants. Ongoing copulations were only rarely interrupted by the rival male (always by a fighter), and the probability of interruption did not depend on the body size difference between the mating male and its rival. Copulations lasted shorter in the presence of a rival fighter, but this effect was not attributable to interruption of copulations. We conclude that the fighting niche is particularly accessible for large males, as larger males have a higher probability of winning pre-copulatory contests. Such mating niche differentiation likely contributes to evolutionary maintenance of condition-dependent male polyphenism, where small males are forced to adopt an alternative mating tactic and hence develop a dedicated morphology.</p>",2021-12-24

Bringing lost carbon back into agricultural soils should be a priority as it brings the added benefit of improving soil properties. Linking soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions of different stability with soil microbial composition can help understand and subsequently manage SOC storage. Here we develop a pipeline for evaluating the effects of microbial management on SOC content using rapid and low-cost SOC fractionation and metagenomics approaches. We tested the methods in a wheat pot trial inoculated with 17 individual endophytic fungal isolates. Two fungi increased total SOC in the area under the plant stem by ~15%. The fractionation assay showed that the medium stability soil aggregate carbon fraction (AggC) was increased by one of these fungi (+21%) and the chemically recalcitrant proportion (bleach oxidation) of AggC by the other (+35%). Both fungi increased mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC), the long-term SOC storage, by ~10%. We used rapid, portable, low-cost, whole metagenome long read sequencing to detect a shift in the microbial composition for one of the fungi-inoculated treatments. This treatment showed a more diverse microbial community and a higher quantity of DNA in soil. The results emphasise the link between composition and abundance of soil microorganisms with soil carbon formation. Our dual carbon fractional and metagenomic analysis pipeline can be used to further test the effects of microbial management and ultimately to model the soil factors that influence SOC storage, such as nutrient and water availability, starting SOC content, soil texture and aggregation.</p>",2021-12-21

Analyses of the transcriptomic profile of <italic>C. glabrata</italic> after the combination of copper and fluconazole showed that the expression of the multidrug transporter gene <italic>CDR1</italic> was decreased, suggesting that fluconazole efflux could be affected. In agreement, we observed that copper inhibits the transactivation of Pdr1, the transcription regulator of multidrug transporters, and leads to the intracellular accumulation of fluconazole. Copper also decreases the transcriptional induction of ergosterol biosynthesis (<italic>ERG</italic>) genes by fluconazole, which culminates in the accumulation of toxic sterols. Co-treatment of cells with copper and fluconazole should affect the function of proteins located in the plasma membrane, as several ultrastructural alterations, including irregular cell wall and plasma membrane and loss of cell wall integrity, were observed. Finally, we show that the combination of copper and fluconazole downregulates the expression of the gene encoding the zinc-responsive transcription regulator Zap1, which possibly, together with the membrane transporters malfunction, generates zinc depletion. Supplementation with zinc reverts the toxic effect of combining copper with fluconazole, underscoring the importance of this metal in the observed synergistic effect. Overall, this work, while unveiling the molecular basis that supports the use of copper to enhance the effectiveness of fluconazole, paves the way for the development of new metal-based antifungal strategies.</p>",2021-12-23

We found that cells on plates coated with ECM proteins had much higher proliferation compared to the regular tissue culture plates. Further, gelatin coated plates helped the cells to grow faster compared to collagen, fibronectin, and laminin coated plates. Additionally, the use of Gelatin showed less size heterogeneity among the cells when expanded from passages P3 to P9. Gelatin also helped in maintaining cellular stiffness which was not observed across other ECM proteins.

In this study, we performed a comprehensive computational analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer complexes with Nb6, VHH E and bi-paratopic VHH VE nanobodies. We combined atomistic dynamics and collective motions analysis with binding free energy scanning, perturbation-response scanning and network centrality analysis to examine mechanisms of nanobody-induced allosteric modulation and cooperativity in the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer complexes with these nanobodies. By quantifying energetic and allosteric determinants of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding with nanobodies, we also examined nanobody-induced modulation of escaping mutations and the effect of the Omicron variant on nanobody binding. The mutational scanning analysis supported the notion that E484A mutation can have a significant detrimental effect on nanobody binding and result in Omicron-induced escape from nanobody neutralization. Our findings showed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may exploit plasticity of specific allosteric hotspots to generate escape mutants that alter response to binding without compromising activity. The network analysis supported these findings showing that VHH VE nanobody binding can induce long-range couplings between the cryptic binding epitope and ACE2-binding site through a broader ensemble of communication paths that is less dependent on specific mediating centers and therefore may be less sensitive to mutational perturbations of functional residues. The results suggest that binding affinity and long-range communications of the SARS-CoV-2 complexes with nanobodies can be determined by structurally stable regulatory centers and conformationally adaptable hotspots that are allosterically coupled and collectively control resilience to mutational escape.</p>",2021-12-23

Although the prevalence of HIV among general people in Asia is considered low, the prevalence of HIV and Syphilis among MSM in this region was found very high and usually, it goes unnoticed. This study aimed to inspect the prevalence and trends of HIV, Syphilis, and their co-infection among MSM in Asia. 
Methods: A systematic search was performed on January 5, 2021, in PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar databases. To evaluate the heterogeneity, Q-tests and were used. To explore the publication bias, Eggers' test and funnel plot were used. The random-effect model and subgroup analysis were performed due to the significant heterogeneity.
Results: A total of 2,872 articles were identified, and 66 articles of high quality were included in the final analysis. The overall prevalence of HIV among MSM and Syphilis was estimated considering 69 estimates from 66 studies whereas 19 estimates of co-infection were found in 17 studies. The pooled HIV prevalence was 8.48% (CI: 7.01-9.95) and the pooled Syphilis prevalence was 9.86% (CI: 8.30-11.41) with significant heterogeneity and publication bias. The pooled prevalence of HIV and Syphilis co-infection was 2.99% (CI: 1.70-4.27) with significant heterogeneity and no publication bias. The HIV, Syphilis, and HIV and Syphilis co-infection prevalence estimates exhibited an upward trend during 2002-2017.
Conclusions: HIV, Syphilis, and their co-infection are quite prevalent among MSM in the Asia-Pacific region. Integrated and intensified intervention strategies, HIV testing, and improved access to antiretroviral treatment as well as increased awareness are needed to reduce HIV, Syphilis, and their co-infection among the discussed vulnerable group.</p>",2021-12-23

In chronic low back pain (LBP), sparse evidence points towards a shift of the cortical representation of sensory afferents of the back. However, systematic investigations of the cortical representation of tactile and proprioceptive paraspinal afferents along the thoracolumbar axis are lacking. Detailed cortical maps of paraspinal afferent input might be crucial to further explore potential relationships between brain changes and the development and maintenance of chronic LBP. We therefore validated a novel and functional magnetic resonance imaging-(fMRI-)compatible method of mapping cortical representations of tactile and proprioceptive afferents of the back, using pneumatic vibrotactile stimulation (“pneuVID”) at varying frequencies and paraspinal locations, in conjunction with high-resolution fMRI. We hypothesised that: (i) high (80 Hz) frequency stimulation would lead to increased postural sway compared to low (20 Hz) stimulation, due to differential evoked mechanoreceptor contributions to postural control (proprioceptive vs tactile); and (ii) that high (80 Hz) versus low (20 Hz) frequency stimulation would be associated with neuronal activity in distinct primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortical targets of tactile and proprioceptive afferents (N=15, healthy volunteers). Additionally, we expected neural representations to vary spatially along the thoracolumbar axis. We found significant differences between neural representations of low and high frequency stimulation and between representations of thoracic and lumbar paraspinal locations, in several bilateral sensorimotor cortical regions. Proprioceptive (80 Hz) stimulation preferentially activated sub-regions S1 3a and M1 4p, while tactile (20 Hz) stimulation was more encoded in S1 3b and M1 4a. Moreover, in S1, lower back proprioceptive stimulation activated dorsal-posterior representations, compared to ventral-anterior representations activated by upper back stimulation. As per our hypotheses, we found distinct sensorimotor cortical tactile and proprioceptive representations, with the latter displaying clear topographic differences between the upper and lower back. This thus represents the first behavioural and neurobiological validation of the novel pneuVID method for stimulating muscle spindles and mapping cortical representations of paraspinal afferents. Future investigations of detailed cortical maps will be of major importance in elucidating the role of cortical reorganization in the pathophysiology of chronic LBP.</p>",2021-12-21

Several approaches exist to link enhancers to their target genes, and others that infer TF-gene connections.

In the present study, we used a tractometry approach to explore patterns of variance in diffusion metrics across white matter (WM) tracts. We investigated whether separate networks, based on normal variation or pathology, appear, and how this relates to neuropsychological test performance across cognitive domains. A sample of 102 relapsing-remitting MS patients and 27 healthy controls underwent MRI and neuropsychological testing. Tractography was performed on diffusion MRI data to extract 40 WM tracts and microstructural measures were extracted from each tract. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to decompose metrics from all tracts to assess the presence of any co-variance structure among the tracts. Similarly, PCA was applied to cognitive test scores to identify the main cognitive domains. Finally, we assessed the ability of tract components to predict test performance across cognitive domains. We found that a single component which captured pathology across all tracts explained the most variance and that there was little evidence for separate, smaller network patterns of pathology. WM tract components were weak, but significant, predictors of cognitive function in MS.

To unravel the global features of these processes, we analyse the world data of SARS-CoV-2 infection events, scrutinising two eight-month periods associated with the epidemic’s outbreak and initial immunisation phase. Based on the correlation-network mapping, K-means clustering, and multifractal time series analysis, our results reveal universal patterns, suggesting potential predominant drivers of the pandemic. More precisely, the Laplacian eigenvectors localisation has revealed robust communities of different countries and regions that then cluster according to similar shapes of infection fluctuations. Apart from quantitative measures, the immunisation phase differs significantly from the epidemic outbreak by the countries and regions constituting each cluster. While the similarity grouping possesses some regional components, the appearance of large clusters spanning different geographic locations is persevering. Furthermore, cyclic trends are characteristic of the identified clusters, dominating large temporal fluctuations of infection evolution, which are prominent in the immunisation phase. Meanwhile, persistent fluctuations around the local trend occur in intervals smaller than 14 days. These results provide a basis for further research into the interplay between biological and social factors as the primary cause of infection cycles and a better understanding of the impact of socio-economical and environmental factors at different phases of the pandemic.</p>",2021-12-21

This study examined the discharge features of these two GPe neuronal subpopulations recorded in four NHPs engaged in a classical conditioning task with cues predicting reward, neutral and aversive outcomes. The results show that LFD neurons tended to burst, encoded the salience of behavioral cues, and exhibited correlated spiking activity.

Here, we focus on linkage analysis in a population sample, but use sequences rather than individuals as our unit of observation. Earlier investigations of sequence-based linkage mapping relied on known sequence relatedness, whereas we infer relatedness from the sequence data. We propose two ways to associate similarity in relatedness of sequences with similarity in their trait values and compare the resulting linkage methods to two genotypic-association methods. We also introduce a procedure to label case sequences as potential carriers or non-carriers of causal variants after an association has been found.

Here we produced MFHR1, a synthetic complement regulator which has been proposed for the treatment of diseases associated to the complement system as part of human innate immunity. We studied the impact of different operation modes for the production process in 5 L stirred-tank photobioreactors. The total amount of recombinant protein was doubled by using fed-batch or batch compared to semi-continuous operation, although the maximum specific productivity (mg MFHR1/g FW) increased just by 35%. We proposed an unstructured kinetic model which fits accurately with the experimental data in batch and semi-continuous operation under autotrophic conditions with 2% CO2 enrichment. The model is able to predict recombinant protein production, nitrate uptake and biomass growth, which is useful for process control and optimization. We investigated strategies to further increase MFHR1 production. While mixotrophic and heterotrophic conditions decreased the MFHR1-specific productivity compared to autotrophic conditions, addition of the phytohormone auxin (NAA, 10 μM) to the medium enhanced it by 470% in shaken flasks and up to 230% and 260%, in batch and fed-batch bioreactors, respectively. Supporting this finding, the auxin-synthesis inhibitor L-Kynurenine (100 μM) decreased MFHR1 production significantly by 110% and 580% at day 7 and 18, respectively. Expression analysis revealed that the MFHR1 transgene, driven by the Physcomitrella actin5 (PpAct5) promoter, was upregulated 16 hours after NAA addition and remained enhanced over the whole process, whereas the auxin-responsive gene PpIAA1A was upregulated within the first two hours, indicating that the effect of auxin on PpAct5 promoter-driven expression is indirect. Furthermore, the day of NAA supplementation was crucial, leading to an up to 8-fold increase of MFHR1-specific productivity (0.82 mg MFHR1/ g fresh weight, 150 mg accumulated over 7 days) compared to the productivity reported previously.

Limited availability of manually curated or experimentally validated plant genes from a diverse range of taxa poses a significant challenge for functional annotation in non-model organisms. Accurate computational approaches are required. We argue that recent breakthroughs in deep learning have the potential to not only narrow the functional annotation gap between non-model and model plant organisms, but also annotate and reveal novel functions even for genes with no homologs in public databases. Results: Deep learning models were applied to functionally annotate a set of previously published differentially expressed genes. Predicted protein structures and functional annotations were generated using the AlphaFold protein structure and DeepFRI protein language inference models respectively. The resulting structures and functional annotations were validated using small molecule docking experiments. DeepFRI and AlphaFold models not only correctly annotated differentially expressed genes, but also revealed detailed mechanisms involving protein-protein interactions. Conclusions: Deep learning models are capable of inferring novel functions and achieving high accuracy in functional annotation. Their increased use in plant research will result in major improvements in annotations for non-model plants that are underrepresented in genome databases.

Altered feeding times in mice are known to entrain clock-gene rhythms in brain and liver and sleep-deprived humans tend to eat more and gain weight. Previous observations in mice showing that sleep deprivation (SD) changes clock-gene expression might thus relate to altered food intake and not to the loss of sleep per se. Whether SD affects food intake in the mouse and how this might affect clock-gene expression is, however, unknown. We therefore quantified i) the cortical expression of the clock genes Per1, Per2, Dbp, and Cry1 in mice that had access to food or not during a 6h SD, and ii) food intake during baseline, SD, and recovery sleep. We found that food deprivation did not modify the SD-incurred clock-gene changes in the cortex. Moreover, we discovered that although food intake during SD did not differ from baseline, mice lost weight and increased food intake during subsequent recovery. We conclude that SD is associated with food deprivation and that the resulting energy deficit might contribute to the effects of SD that are commonly interpreted as a response to sleep loss.</p>",2021-12-23

All populations (Madeira especially), show high levels of inbreeding and low levels of genetic diversity, seemingly declining since historical time, but surprisingly not being impacted by the 1997 massive die-off in Cabo Blanco.

In this work we used a simulation platform, The Virtual Brain, to simulate brain dynamics in healthy controls and in Alzheimer's disease, Frontotemporal Dementia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis patients. The brain connectome and functional connectivity were extracted from 3T-MRI scans and The Virtual Brain nodes were represented by a Wong-Wang neural mass model endowing an explicit representation of the excitatory/inhibitory balance. The integration of cerebro-cerebellar loops improved the correlation between experimental and simulated functional connectivity, and hence The Virtual Brain predictive power, in all pathological conditions.

These physio-pathological parameters allowed an advanced analysis of patients' state. In backward regressions, The Virtual Brain parameters significantly contributed to explain the variation of neuropsychological scores and, in discriminant analysis, the combination of The Virtual Brain parameters and neuropsychological scores significantly improved discriminative power between clinical conditions. Eventually, cluster analysis provided a unique description of the excitatory/inhibitory balance in individual patients.

In this report, we show that the sequential administration of lentiviral vector (LV)-mediated intracerebral (IC) GT and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in pre-symptomatic SD mice provide a timely and long-lasting source of the Hex enzyme in the central and peripheral nervous systems and peripheral tissues, leading to global rescue of the disease phenotype. Combined therapy showed a clear therapeutic advantage compared to individual treatments in terms of lifespan extension and normalization of the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative phenotypes of the SD mice. These benefits correlated with a time-dependent increase in Hex activity and a remarkable reduction in GM2 storage in the brain tissues that single treatments failed to achieve. Our results highlight the complementary and synergic mode of action of LV-mediated IC GT and BMT, clarify the relative contribution of treatments to the therapeutic outcome, and inform on the realistic threshold of enzymatic activity that is required to achieve a significant therapeutic benefit, with important implications for the monitoring and interpretation of ongoing experimental therapies, and for the design of more effective treatment strategies for GM2 gangliosidosis.</p>",2021-12-23

Data sources:  We searched Medline, Embase, PsychInfo, Publons, Scopus and the Public Health England behavioural science LitRep database from inception to 17th September 2021 for relevant studies. 
Study selection: We included studies which collected observational data of at least one of three health protective behaviours (hand hygiene, face covering use and maintaining physical distance from others (social distancing) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies where observational data were compared to self-report data in relation to any infectious disease were also included.
Data extraction and synthesis: We evaluated the quality of studies using the NIH quality assessment scale for observational studies, extracted data on sample size, setting and adherence to health protective behaviours, and synthesized results narratively.  
Results: Of 27,279 published papers on COVID-19 relevant health protective behaviours that included one or more terms relating to hand hygiene, face covering and social distancing, we identified 48 studies that included an objective observational measure. Of these, 35 assessed face covering use, 17 assessed hand hygiene behaviour and seven assessed physical distancing. The general quality of these studies was good. When expanding the search to all infectious diseases, we included 21 studies that compared observational versus self-report data. These almost exclusively studied hand hygiene. The difference in outcomes was striking, with self-report over-estimating observed adherence by up to a factor of five in some settings. In only four papers did self-report match observational data in any domains. 
Conclusions: Despite their importance in controlling the pandemic, we found remarkably few studies assessing protective behaviours by observation, rather than self-report, though these studies tended to be of reasonably good quality. Observed adherence tends to be substantially lower than estimates obtained via self-report. Accurate assessment of levels of personal protective behaviour, and evaluation of interventions to increase this, would benefit from the use of observational methods.</p>",2021-12-23

Surprisingly, little information is available on the impact of trisomy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) on microglia in DS brain development and AD in DS (DSAD). Using our new induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based human microglia-containing cerebral organoid and chimeric mouse brain models, here we report that DS microglia exhibit enhanced synaptic pruning function during brain development. Consequently, electrophysiological recordings demonstrate that DS microglial mouse chimeras show impaired synaptic neurotransmission, as compared to control microglial chimeras. Upon being exposed to human brain tissue-derived soluble pathological tau, DS microglia display dystrophic phenotypes in chimeric mouse brains, recapitulating microglial responses seen in human AD and DSAD brain tissues. Further flow cytometry, single-cell RNA-sequencing, and immunohistological analyses of chimeric mouse brains demonstrate that DS microglia undergo cellular senescence and exhibit elevated type I interferon signaling after being challenged by pathological tau. Mechanistically, we find that shRNA-mediated knockdown of Hsa21encoded type I interferon receptor genes, IFNARs, rescues the defective DS microglial phenotypes both during brain development and in response to pathological tau. Our findings provide first in vivo evidence supporting a paradigm shifting theory that human microglia respond to pathological tau by exhibiting accelerated senescence and dystrophic phenotypes. Our results further suggest that targeting IFNARs may improve microglial functions during DS brain development and prevent human microglial senescence in DS individuals with AD.</p>",2021-12-23

While direct subsidy effects on primary productivity are relatively well known (the green food web), the indirect effects of subsidies on producers as mediated by the brown food web and predators have been neglected. With a dynamical green-brown food web model, parameterized using empirical estimates from the literature, we illustrate the effect of nutrient subsidies on net primary productivity (i.e., after removing loss to herbivory) in two generic ecosystems, terrestrial and aquatic. We find that nutrient subsidies increase net primary productivity because more nutrients are available, but this effect saturates with higher subsidies. Changing the quality of subsidies from inorganic to organic tends to increase net primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems, but less often so in aquatic ecosystems. This occurs when organic nutrient inputs promote detritivores in the brown food web, and hence predators that in turn control herbivores, thus promoting primary productivity. This previously largely overlooked effect is further enhanced by ecosystem properties such as fast decomposition and low rates of nutrient additions, and demonstrates the importance of nutrient subsidy quality on ecosystem functioning.</p>",2021-12-23

Our results confirmed the presence of nuclear-encoded mRNAs in the mitochondrial fraction, which in unperturbed conditions, are mainly transcripts encoding large proteins with specific properties, like transmembrane domains. To further explore the principles of mitochondrial protein compartmentalization in zebrafish, we quantified the transcriptomic changes for each subcellular fraction triggered by the chchd4a-/- mutation, causing the disorders in the mitochondrial protein import. Our results indicate that the proteostatic stress further restricts the population of transcripts on the mitochondrial surface, allowing only the largest and the most evolutionary conserved proteins to be synthetized there. We also show that many nuclear-encoded mitochondrial transcripts translated by the cytosolic ribosomes stay resistant to the global translation shutdown. Thus, vertebrates, in contrast to yeast, are not likely to employ localized translation to facilitate synthesis of mitochondrial proteins under proteostatic stress conditions.</p>",2021-12-23

However, isolation of these islets involves removal of crucial matrix and vasculature that supports islets in the intact pancreas. Unsurprisingly, these islets demonstrate reduced functionality over time in standard culture conditions, thereby limiting their value for understanding native islet biology. Leveraging a novel, vascularized micro-organ (VMO) approach, we have recapitulated elements of the native pancreas by incorporating isolated human islets within a three-dimensional matrix nourished by living, perfusable blood vessels. Importantly, these islets show long-term viability and maintain robust glucose-stimulated insulin responses. Furthermore, vessel-mediated delivery of immune cells to these tissues provides a model to assess islet-immune cell interactions and subsequent islet killing -- key steps in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis.

Our analysis shows that the growth kinetics of the aggregation process is distinctly different for each pathway and bears the signature of the specific cell-cell interactions.

In neurons with V-shaped tuning curves, although tone-evoked excitation and inhibition were highly correlated, the spontaneous inhibitory event rate was typically sufficiently lower than the spontaneous excitatory event rate to indicate a lower excitatory-inhibitory correlation for spontaneous activity than for tone-evoked responses.</p>",2021-12-21

Dogs are a robust model for invasive UC as tumor development and progression is similar in humans and dogs. Recent studies on urine microbiota in humans revealed alterations in microbial diversity and composition in individuals with UC; however, the potential role of microbiota in UC has yet to be elucidated.
