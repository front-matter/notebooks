Methods: We recruited COVID-19 cases to give blood, saliva, mid-turbinate and fomite (phone) swabs, and 30-minute breath samples while vocalizing into a Gesundheit-II, with and without masks at up to two visits two days apart. We quantified and sequenced viral RNA, cultured virus, and assayed sera for anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain antibodies. 
Results: We enrolled 61 participants with active infection, May 2020 through April 2021. Among 49 seronegative cases (mean days post onset 3.8 ±2.1), we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 45% of fine (≥5 μm), 31% of coarse (&gt;5 μm) aerosols, and 65% of fomite samples overall and in all samples from four alpha variant cases. Masks reduced viral RNA by 48% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3 to 72%) in fine and by 77% (95% CI, 51 to 89%) in coarse aerosols. The alpha variant was associated with a 43-fold (95% CI, 6.6 to 280-fold) increase in fine aerosol viral RNA that remained a significant 18-fold (95% CI, 3.4 to 92-fold) increase adjusting for viral RNA in saliva, in mid-turbinate swabs, and other potential confounders. Two fine aerosol samples, collected days 2-3 post illness onset, while participants wore masks, were culture-positive.
Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 is evolving toward more efficient airborne transmission and loose-fitting masks provide significant but only modest source control. Therefore, until vaccination rates are very high, continued layered controls and tight-fitting masks and respirators will be necessary.</p>",2021-08-13

The mechanism that drives this global replacement has not been defined. Here we report that Delta spike mutation P681R plays a key role in the Alpha-to-Delta variant replacement. In a replication competition assay, Delta SARS-CoV-2 efficiently outcompeted the Alpha variant in human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues. Delta SARS-CoV-2 bearing the Alpha-spike glycoprotein replicated less efficiently than the wild-type Delta variant, suggesting the importance of Delta spike in enhancing viral replication. The Delta spike has accumulated mutation P681R located at a furin cleavage site that separates the spike 1 (S1) and S2 subunits. Reverting the P681R mutation to wild-type P681 significantly reduced the replication of Delta variant, to a level lower than the Alpha variant. Mechanistically, the Delta P681R mutation enhanced the cleavage of the full-length spike to S1 and S2, leading to increased infection via cell surface entry. In contrast, the Alpha spike also has a mutation at the same amino acid (P681H), but the spike cleavage from purified Alpha virions was reduced compared to the Delta spike. Collectively, our results indicate P681R as a key mutation in enhancing Delta variant replication via increased S1/S2 cleavage. Spike mutations that potentially affect furin cleavage efficiency must be closely monitored for future variant surveillance.</p>",2021-08-13

We evaluated the transmission dynamics and epidemiological characteristics of the Delta variant in an outbreak in southern China. 

Methods: Data on confirmed cases and their close contacts were retrospectively collected from the outbreak that occurred in Guangdong, China in May-June 2021. Key epidemiological parameters, temporal trend of viral loads and secondary attack rates were estimated and compared between the Delta variant and the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus. We also evaluated the association of vaccination with viral load and transmission. 

Results: We identified 167 patients infected with the Delta variant in the Guangdong outbreak. The mean estimates of the latent period and the incubation period were 4.0 days and 5.8 days, respectively. A relatively higher viral load was observed in Delta cases than in wild-type infections. The secondary attack rate among close contacts of Delta cases was 1.4%, and 73.9% (95% confidence interval: 67.2%, 81.3%) of the transmissions occurred before onset. Index cases without vaccination (OR: 2.84, 95% confidence interval: 1.19, 8.45) or with one dose of vaccination (OR: 6.02, 95% confidence interval: 2.45, 18.16) were more likely to transmit infection to their contacts than those who had received 2 doses of vaccination.

Discussion: Patients infected with the Delta variant had more rapid symptom onset. The shorter and time-varying serial interval should be accounted in estimation of reproductive numbers. The higher viral load and higher risk of pre-symptomatic transmission indicated the challenges in control of infections with the Delta variant.</p>",2021-08-13

These vast stretches of tandem DNA repeats undergo high rates of sequence turnover, resulting in radically different satellite DNA landscapes between closely related species. Such extreme evolutionary plasticity suggests that satellite DNA accumulates mutations with no functional consequence. Paradoxically, satellite-rich genomic regions support essential, conserved nuclear processes, including chromosome segregation, dosage compensation, and nuclear structure. A leading resolution to this paradox is that deleterious alterations to satellite DNA trigger adaptive evolution of chromatin proteins to preserve these essential functions. Here we experimentally test this model of coevolution between chromatin proteins and DNA satellites by conducting an evolution-guided manipulation of both protein and satellite. We focused on an adaptively evolving, ovary-enriched chromatin protein, called Maternal Haploid (MH) from Drosophila. MH co-localizes with an 11 Mb 359-bp satellite array present in Drosophila melanogaster but absent in its sister species, D. simulans. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transgenesis, we swapped the D. simulans version of MH into D. melanogaster. We discovered that D. melanogaster females encoding only the D. simulans mh (mh[sim]) do not phenocopy the mh null mutation. Instead, MH[sim] is toxic to D. melanogaster ovaries: we observed elevated ovarian cell death, reduced ovary size, and subfertility in mh[sim] females. Using both cell biological and genetic approaches, we demonstrate that MH[sim] poisons oogenesis through a DNA damage pathway. Remarkably, deleting the D. melanogaster-specific 359 satellite array from mh[sim] females completely restores female germline genome integrity and fertility. This genetic rescue offers experimental evidence that rapid evolution resulted in a cross-species incompatibility between the 359 satellite and MH. These data suggest that coevolution between ostensibly inert repetitive DNA and essential chromatin proteins preserves germline genome integrity.</p>",2021-08-13

With the number of tools in the database passing 1000, we take this opportunity to provide an update on the state of the project and the field. Analysis of five years of analysis tool tracking data clearly shows the evolution of the field, and that the focus of developers has moved from ordering cells on continuous trajectories to integrating multiple samples and making use of reference datasets. We also find evidence that open science practices reward developers with increased recognition and help accelerate the field.</p>",2021-08-14

But shortly thereafter, inconsistencies in the results of further clinical trials raised doubts on the efficacy of these agents. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of Remdesivir on hospitalized COVID-19 patients' outcomes.
Material and methods: This study was an open-label, single-armed, clinical trial on hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who had progressive respiratory symptoms despite receiving standard care. All patients received Remdesivir and their characteristics, outcomes, time of treatment initiation, and respiratory support stages during hospitalization were registered and followed up for 14 days.
Results: 145 patients with a mean age of 52.89 +- 1.12 years enrolled in this study, 38 (26.2%) died at the end of 14 days period. The mean time interval from the onset of the symptoms to antiviral treatment was 10.63+-0.56 days.  Thirty deceased patients (78.9%) were men, showing 2.8 times higher mortality chance compared to women (ORadj=2.77; 95%CI=1.08-7.09). The type of respiratory support on the first day of treatment initiation showed a significantly lower mortality chance in patients receiving O2 only than those who needed non-invasive and/or mechanical ventilation (ORadj=3.91; 95%CI=1.64-9.32). The start time (early vs late administration) and duration (less or more than 7 days) of antiviral treatment had no statistically significant association with mortality or ventilation escalation among the patients (p-value &gt; 0.05). 
Conclusion: In this study, we showed that Remdesivir probably is not effective on the outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.</p>",2021-08-13

Among reptiles, gecko lizards (infraorder Gekkota) have shown an exceptional lability with regard to sex chromosome transitions and may possess the majority of transitions within squamates (lizards and snakes). However—across geckos—information about sex chromosome linkage is expressly lacking, leaving large gaps in our understanding of the evolutionary processes at play in this system. To address this gap, we assembled the first chromosome-level genome for a gecko and use this linkage information to survey six Sphaerodactylus species using a variety of genomic data, including whole-genome re-sequencing, RADseq, and RNAseq.

Inhibition of mTORC1 extends lifespan, but also frequently has other effects such as stunted growth, slowed development, reduced fertility, and disrupted metabolism. It has long been assumed that suppression of anabolism and resulting phenotypes such as impaired growth and reproduction may be causal to mTORC1 longevity, but this hypothesis has not been directly tested. RAGA-1 is an upstream activator of TORC1. Previous work from our lab using a <italic>C. elegans</italic> model of mTORC1 longevity, the long-lived <italic>raga-1</italic> null mutant, found that the presence of <italic>raga-1</italic> only in the neurons suppresses longevity of the null mutant. Here, we use the auxin-inducible degradation (AID) system to test whether neuronal mTORC1 inhibition is sufficient for longevity, and whether any changes in lifespan are also linked to stunted growth or fertility.

We also find that AID of RAGA-1 or LET-363/mTOR beginning at day 1 of adulthood extends lifespan to a similar extent. Unlike somatic degradation of RAGA-1, neuronal degradation of RAGA-1 doesn’t impair growth, slow development, or decrease the reproductive capacity of the worms. Lastly, while AID of LET-363/mTOR in all somatic cells shortens lifespan, neuronal AID of LET-363/mTOR slows aging. This work demonstrates that targeting mTORC1 specifically in the neurons uncouples longevity from growth and reproductive impairments, challenging previously held ideas about the mechanisms of mTORC1 longevity and elucidating the promise of tissue-specific aging therapeutics.</p>",2021-08-12

Generally, single-molecule RNA FISH techniques have shown mixed results in formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues such as those preserved from human autopsies. Here, we present a platform for preparing autopsy tissue for visualizing SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RNA FISH with amplification by hybridization chain reaction (HCR). We developed probe sets that target different regions of SARS-CoV-2 (including ORF1a and N) as well as probe sets that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic mRNAs. We validated these probe sets in cell culture and tissues (lung, lymph node, and placenta) from infected patients. Using this technology, we observe distinct subcellular localization patterns of the ORF1a and N regions, with the ORF1a concentrated around the nucleus and the N showing a diffuse distribution across the cytoplasm.

Furthermore, we multiplex this assay with probes for cellular genes to determine what cell-types are infected within the lung.

We find that neutralising activity against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 is highly predictive of neutralisation of the VOC, with all vaccines showing a similar drop in neutralisation to the variants. Neutralisation levels remain strongly correlated with protection from infection with SARS-CoV-2 VOC (r=0.81, p=0.0005). We apply an existing model relating in vitro neutralisation to protection (parameterised on data from ancestral virus infection) and find this remains predictive of vaccine efficacy against VOC once drops in neutralisation to the VOC are taken into account. Modelling of predicted vaccine efficacy against variants over time suggests that protection against symptomatic infection may drop below 50% within the first year after vaccination for some current vaccines. Boosting of previously infected individuals with existing vaccines (which target ancestral virus) has been shown to significantly increase neutralising antibodies.

More than 75% of the monoclonal antibodies from naïve people lost their neutralization activity against the B.1.351 (beta) and B.1.1.248 (gamma) variants while this happened only for 61% of those from convalescents. The overall loss of neutralization was lower for the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants, however it was always significantly higher in those of naïve people. In part this was due to the IGHV2-5;IGHJ4-1 germline, which was found only in convalescents and generated potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies. Overall, vaccination of seropositive people increases the frequency of B cells encoding antibodies with high potency and that are not susceptible to escape by any of the four variants of concern.

Using budding yeast, we probe the extent of composability, or independent effects, of distinct CREs. We confirm that the quantitative effect of a terminator on gene expression depends on both promoter and coding sequence. We then explore whether individual cis-regulatory motifs within terminator regions display similar context dependence, focusing on putative regulatory motifs inferred using transcriptome-wide datasets of mRNA decay. We construct a library of diverse reporter genes, consisting of different combinations of motifs within various terminator contexts, paired with different promoters, to test the extent of composability. Our results show that the effect of a motif on RNA abundance depends both on its host terminator, and also on the associated promoter sequence.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in a 30% mortality rate in thoracic cancer patients. Given that cancer patients were excluded from serum anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) vaccine registration trials, it is still unknown whether they would develop a protective anti-spike antibody response following vaccination. This prospective vaccine monitoring study primarily aimed to assess humoral responses to SARS-CoV2 vaccine in thoracic cancer patients. 

Methods
SARS-CoV2-spike antibodies were measured using Abbot ARCHITECT SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay, prior to first injection of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, as well as at Week 4, and two-to-sixteen weeks after second vaccine dose. The factors associated with antibody response were analyzed.

Results
Overall, 306 patients, with a median age of 67.0 years (IQR=58-74), were vaccinated. Of these, 283 patients received two vaccine doses at 28-day intervals. After 4.7-month median follow-up, seven patients (2.3%) contracted proven symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, with rapid favorable evolution. Of 269 serological results available beyond Day 14 post-second vaccine dose, 17 (6.3%) were still negative (&lt;50 AU/mL) (arbitrary units/mL), while 34 (11%) were &lt;300 AU/mL (12.5th percentile). In multivariate analysis, only age and chronic corticosteroid treatment were significantly associated with a lack of immunization.

Methods: A prospective cohort of 332 COVID-19 patients was followed beyond one year. Plasma neutralizing activity was evaluated using HIV-based reporter pseudoviruses expressing different SARS-CoV-2 spikes and was longitudinally analyzed using mixed-effects models.

Findings: Long-term neutralizing activity was stable beyond one year after infection in mild/asymptomatic and hospitalized participants. However, longitudinal models suggest that hospitalized individuals generate both short- and long-lived memory B cells, while outpatient responses were dominated by long-lived B cells. In both groups, vaccination boosted responses to natural infection, although viral variants, mainly B.1.351, reduced the efficacy of neutralization. Importantly, despite showing higher neutralization titers, hospitalized patients showed lower cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variant compared to outpatients. Multivariate analysis identified severity of primary infection as the factor that independently determines both the magnitude and the inferior cross-neutralization activity of long-term neutralizing responses.

Conclusions: Neutralizing response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is heterogeneous in magnitude but stable beyond one year after infection. Vaccination boosts these long-lasting natural neutralizing responses, counteracting the significant resistance to neutralization of new viral variants. Severity of primary infection determines higher magnitude but poorer quality of long-term neutralizing responses.</p>",2021-08-13

Reopening guidance emphasized PCR or antigen testing for residential students and social distancing measures to reduce the frequency of close interpersonal contact.  Connecticut colleges and universities employed a variety of approaches to reopening campuses to residential students. Methods: We used data on testing, cases, and social contact in 18 residential college and university campuses in Connecticut to characterize institutional reopening strategies and COVID-19 outcomes. We compared institutions' fall 2020 COVID-19 plans, submitted to the Connecticut Department of Public Health, and analyzed contact rates and COVID-19 outcomes throughout the academic year.  Results: In census block groups containing residence halls, fall student move-in resulted in a 475% (95% CI 373%-606%) increase in average contact, and spring move-in resulted in a 561% (441%-713%) increase in average contact. The relationship between test frequency and case rate per residential student was complex: institutions that tested students infrequently detected few cases but failed to blunt transmission, while institutions that tested students more frequently detected more cases and prevented further spread. In fall 2020, each additional test per student per week was associated with a reduction of 0.0014 cases per student per week (95% CI: -0.0028, -0.000012). Residential student case rates were associated with higher case rates in the town where the school was located, but it is not possible to determine whether on-campus infections were transmitted to the broader community or vice versa. Conclusions: Campus outbreaks among residential students might be avoided or mitigated by frequent testing, social distancing, and mandatory vaccination.

Undecorated E254A and E254N MTs with 13 protofilaments both have an expanded lattice, but display opposite protofilament twists, making these lattices distinct from the compacted lattice of wildtype GDP-MTs. End binding proteins of the EB family have the ability to compact both mutant GTP-lattices and to stabilize a negative twist, suggesting that they promote this transition also in the GTP cap of wildtype MTs, thereby contributing to the maturation of the MT structure.

We collected empirical data on syntenic block sizes and other genomic features from 27 plant species each with a different history of paleopolyploidy. Features from these genomes were used to develop simulations of syntenic blocks and paleologs to train a gradient boosted decision tree.

Most flatworms are hermaphrodites but schistosomes have genotypically determined male (ZZ) and female (ZW) sexes. Sex is essential for pathology and transmission, however, the molecular determinants of sex remain unknown and is limited by poorly resolved sex chromosomes in previous genome assemblies. Results: We assembled the 391.4 Mb S. mansoni genome into individual, single-scaffold chromosomes, including Z and W. Manual curation resulted in a vastly improved gene annotation, resolved gene and repeat arrays, trans-splicing, and almost all UTRs. The sex chromosomes each comprise pseudoautosomal regions and single sex-specific regions. The Z-specific region contains 932 genes, but on W all but 29 of these genes have been lost and the presence of five pseudogenes indicates that degeneration of W is ongoing. Synteny analysis reveals an ancient chromosomal fusion corresponding to the oldest part of Z, where only a single gene-encoding the large subunit of pre-mRNA splicing factor U2AF has retained an intact copy on W. The sex-specific copies of U2AF have divergent N-termini and show sex-biased gene expression. Conclusion: Our assembly with fully resolved chromosomes provides evidence of an evolutionary path taken to create the Z and W sex chromosomes of schistosomes. Sex-linked divergence of the single U2AF gene, which has been present in the sex-specific regions longer than any other extant gene with distinct male and female specific copies and expression, may have been a pivotal step in the evolution of gonorchorism and genotypic sex determination of schistosomes.</p>",2021-08-13

Time-resolved dynamics of the MT tip - a key determinant of this behavior - as a function of nucleotide state, internal lattice strain, and stabilizing lateral interactions have not been fully understood. Here, we use atomistic simulations to study the spontaneous relaxation of complete GTP-MT and GDP-MT tip models from unfavorable straight to relaxed splayed conformations and to comprehensively characterize the elasticity of MT tips. Our simulations reveal the dominance of viscoelastic dynamics of MT protofilaments during the relaxation process, driven by the stored bending-torsional strain and counterbalanced by the inter-protofilament interactions. We show that the post-hydrolysis MT tip is exposed to higher activation energy barriers for straight lattice formation, which translates into its inability to elongate.

It is unclear whether such differences are due to factors at the level of the human host, or at the level of the coronavirus, or both. At the host level, the entry proteins which allow virus binding and entry have variants with distinct properties, and the frequency of such variants differs between ethnicities. At the level of the virus, the D614G mutation enhances virus entry to the host cell. Since the two virus strains (D614 and G614) co-existed in the first six months of the pandemic in most populations, it has been difficult to distinguish between contributions of the virus and contributions of the host for anosmia. To answer this question, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in South Asian populations when either the D614 or the G614 virus was dominant. We show that populations infected predominantly with the G614 virus had a much higher prevalence of anosmia (pooled prevalence of 31.8%) compared with the same ethnic populations infected mostly with the D614 virus strain (pooled anosmia prevalence of 5.3%). We conclude that the D614G mutation is a major contributing factor that increases the prevalence of anosmia in COVID-19, and that this enhanced effect on olfaction constitutes a previously unrecognized phenotype of the D614G mutation. The new virus strains that have additional mutations on the background of the D614G mutation can be expected to cause a similarly increased prevalence of chemosensory dysfunctions.</p><sec><title>Graphical Abstract</title><fig id=""ufig1"" position=""float"" orientation=""portrait"" fig-type=""figure""><graphic xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""21261934v1_ufig1"" position=""float"" orientation=""portrait"" /></fig></sec>",2021-08-12

In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of PRRSV-2 and swine influenza H3N2 virus co-infection on the efficacy of PRRSV modified live virus (MLV) vaccination, which is widely used in the field. Following simultaneous challenge with contemporary PRRSV-2 and H3N2 field isolates, we found that the protective effect of PRRS MLV vaccination on clinical disease and pathology was abrogated, although viral load was unaffected and antibody responses were enhanced. In contrast, co-infection in non-immunized animals reduced PRRSV-2 viremia and H3N2 virus load in the upper respiratory tract and potentiated T cell responses against both PRRSV-2 and H3N2 in the lung. Further analysis suggested that an upregulation of inhibitory cytokines gene expression in the lungs of vaccinated pigs may have influenced responses to H3N2 and PRRSV-2.

Here we show that Ecm11, a SC central element protein, localizes on both DSB sites and sites that attach chromatin loops to the chromosome axis, which are the starting points of SC formation, in a way that strictly requires the ZMM protein Zip4. Furthermore, Zip4 directly interacts with Ecm11 and point mutants that specifically abolish this interaction lose Ecm11 binding to chromosomes and exhibit defective SC assembly. This can be partially rescued by artificially tethering interaction-defective Ecm11 to Zip4. Mechanistically, this direct connection ensuring SC assembly from CO sites could be a way for the meiotic cell to shut down further DSB formation once enough recombination sites have been selected for crossovers, thereby preventing excess crossovers.

As We used the COVID-19 Simulator, an interactive online tool that utilizes a validated mathematical model, to simulate the trajectory of COVID-19 at the state level in the U.S. COVID-19 Simulator's forecasts are updated weekly and included in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ensemble model. We employed our model to analyze scenarios where the Delta variant becomes dominant in every state.
 
The combination of high transmissibility of the Delta variant, low vaccination coverage in several regions, and a more relaxed attitude towards social distancing is expected to result in a surge in COVID-19 deaths in at least 40 states. In several states -- including Idaho, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Washington, and West Virginia -- the projected daily deaths in 2021 could exceed the prior peak daily deaths under current social distancing behavior and vaccination rate. The number of COVID-19 deaths across the U.S. could exceed 1600 per day. 

Between August 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021, there could be additional 157,000 COVID-19 deaths across the U.S. Of note, our model projected approximately 20,700 COVID-19 deaths in Texas, 16,000 in California, 12,400 in Florida, 12,000 in North Carolina, and 9,300 in Georgia during this period. In contrast, the projected number of COVID-19 deaths would remain below 200 in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, and Rhode Island.  

We project COVID-19 deaths based on the current vaccination rates and social distancing behavior. Our hope is that the findings of this report serve a warning sign and people revert to wearing masks and maintain social distancing to reduce COVID-19 associated deaths in the U.S. Our projections are updated weekly by incorporating vaccination rates and social distancing measures in each state; the latest results can be found at the COVID-19 Simulator website.</p>",2021-08-13

We built a robot arm system with four degrees of freedom, including a visual system for locating the planar position of the hand, joint angle proprioception, and pressure sensing in one point of contact.

Background
Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are increasingly adopting low-cost Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapid antigen tests to meet the high demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Whilst testing using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the current gold standard, its widespread use in LMICs is limited by high costs, turnaround times and is not readily available in most places. COVID-19 antigen tests (Ag-RDT) provide a suitable alternative due to their low cost, rapid turnaround time and easy to set up and use. This study aimed to assess the field performance of the NowCheck COVID-19 antigen kit (Ag-RDT) as a point of care test (POCT) in select healthcare facilities in western Kenya.  
Methods
We conducted a prospective multi-facility field evaluation study of the NowCheck COVID-19 rapid antigen test (Ag-RDT) compared to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (RT-PCR). After obtaining informed consent, trained laboratory technicians collected two pairs of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs, both antigen and RT-PCR testing, first for Ag-RDT and next for RT-PCR. We performed Ag-RDTs on-site and shared the results with both the study participants and their healthcare providers within 15-30 minutes. We carried out all RT-PCR tests in a central referral laboratory. The turnaround time for RT-PCR results was typically 24-48 hours. We captured the results of both methods using an electronic digital application.
Findings
Between December 2020 and March 2021, we enrolled 997 participants who met the Kenyan Ministry of Health COVID-19 case definition. The median age of study participants was 39 years (range one to 80 years), with 54% male. Ag-RDT had a sensitivity of 84.5% (76.0-90.8) and a specificity of 94.4% (95% CI: 92.7-95.8) with an accuracy of 94.2% (92.5- 95.6) when a cycle threshold value (Ct value) of ≤35 was used. The highest sensitivity of 87.7% (77.2-94.5) was observed in samples with Ct values ≤ 30 and the highest specificity of 97.5% (96.2-98.5) at Ct value of &lt;40. 
Interpretation
The NowCheck COVID-19 Ag-RDT showed good performance in field evaluation in multiple healthcare facilities in a developing country. The sensitivity of the kit exceeded the minimum recommended cut-off of 80% as recommended by WHO1.  The high specificity of this kit at 94.4% at Ct values ≤33 and 97.5% at Ct values &lt;40 matched that of real-time PCR, making it a good rule-out test for symptomatic patients with COVID-19- like symptoms. The faster turnaround time to results, lower cost, simple analytical steps requiring no equipment or infrastructure makes antigen testing an attractive field-screening method to meet the high demand for COVID-19 testing.</p>",2021-08-13

It is well known that T is produced in the gonads, but T is also produced in the mesocorticolimbic system, which modulates behavioural flexibility. It is unclear how T produced in the brain versus the gonads influences behavioural flexibility. Here, we assess the effects of the androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate (ABI) and long-term gonadectomy (GDX) on behavioural flexibility in two paradigms. In Experiment 1, ABI independent of GDX reduced the number of trials to criterion and perseverative errors in a strategy set-shifting task. Similarly, in Experiment 2, ABI but not GDX reduced perseverative errors in a reversal learning task. In subjects from Experiment 1, we also examined tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-ir), and ABI but not GDX increased TH-ir in the mPFC. Our findings suggest that neurally-produced androgens modulate behavioural flexibility via modification of dopamine signalling in the mesocorticolimbic system.

Inference performance was consistently better following progressive training, and for pairs further apart in the transitive hierarchy. BOLD pattern similarity correlated with hierarchical distances in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). These results are consistent with the use of representations that directly encode structural relationships between different task features. Furthermore, BOLD patterns in MPFC were similar across the two independent hierarchies. We conclude that humans preferentially employ encoding-based mechanisms to store map-like relational codes that can be used for memory generalisation. While both MTL and MPFC support these representations, the MPFC encodes more abstract relational information.</p>",2021-08-11

McFarland'}, {'name': 'Pradipta R. Ray'}, {'name': 'Salman Bhai'}, {'name': 'Benjamin Levine'}, {'name': 'Theodore J. Price'}]","<p>Lack of physical activity is a predictor of poor health outcomes that can be prevented or reversed by exercise. Sedentary lifestyle, chronic disease or microgravity can cause muscle deconditioning that then has an impact on other physiological systems. An example is the nervous system, which is adversely affected by decreased physical activity resulting in increased incidence of neurological problems such as chronic pain. We sought to better understand how this might occur by conducting RNA sequencing experiments on muscle biopsies from human volunteers in a 5-week bed-rest study with an exercise intervention arm. We also used a computational method for examining ligand-receptor interactions between muscle and human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, the latter of which play a key role in nociception and are generators of signals responsible for chronic pain. We identified 1352 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in bed rest subjects without an exercise intervention but only 132 DEGs in subjects with the intervention. Thirty-six genes were shared between the exercise and no intervention groups. Among 591 upregulated muscle genes in the no intervention arm, 26 of these were ligands that have receptors that are expressed by human DRG neurons. We detected a specific splice variant of one of these ligands, placental growth factor (PGF), in deconditioned muscle that binds to neuropilin 1, a receptor that is highly expressed in DRG neurons and known to promote neuropathic pain. We conclude that exercise intervention protects muscle from deconditioning transcriptomic changes, and prevents changes in expression of ligands that might sensitize DRG neurons that promote pain. Our work creates a set of actionable hypotheses to better understand how deconditioned muscle may influence the function of sensory neurons that innervate the entire body.</p>",2021-08-12

Here, we investigated whether gut bacteria affect the hallmarks of Huntington's disease (HD) in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) models expressing human full-length or N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin (HTT) protein, here referred to as HD flies. We find that elimination of commensal gut bacteria by antibiotics reduces the aggregation of amyloidogenic N-terminal fragments of HTT and delays the development of motor defects. Conversely, colonization of HD flies with Escherichia coli (E. coli), a known pathobiont of human gut, accelerates HTT aggregation, aggravates immobility and shortens life span. Similar to antibiotics, treatment of HD flies with compounds such as luteolin, a flavone, or crocin a beta-carotenoid, ameliorates disease phenotypes and promotes survival. Crocin prevents colonization of E. coli in the HD flies gut and alters the levels of commensal bacteria, which may be linked to its protective effects. The opposing effects of E. coli and crocin on HTT aggregation, motor defects and survival in transgenic Drosophila support the involvement of gut-brain networks in the pathogenesis of HD.</p>",2021-08-13

Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing however, has the potential to provide new insights into the regulation of gene expression for many genes at once while simultaneously retaining information regarding the position of each nucleus prior to dissociation based on patterned gene expression. In order to establish the practicality of single-nucleus RNA sequencing in the context of a real biological question, here we look at the difference in gene expression between control and an insulator protein, dCTCF, maternal null embryos during zygotic genome activation at nuclear cycle 14. We find that early embryonic nuclei can be grouped into distinct clusters according to gene expression. From both virtual and published in situ hybridizations, we also find that these clusters correspond to spatial regions of the embryo. Lastly, we present multiple examples of differential gene expression between control and maternal CTCF null nuclei in one or more clusters, but not in bulk when grouping expression across all nuclei. These results highlight the potential for single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to reveal new insights into the regulation of gene expression in the early Drosophila melanogaster embryo.</p>",2021-08-13

A black yeast Aureobasidium pullulans AFO 202 strain produced beta 1,3 1,6 glucan has been reported to offer potential immune enhancement and metabolism balancing, as well as mitigation of coagulopathy risks. The N 163 strain produced beta glucan is an efficient anti-inflammatory immune modulator. In this pilot clinical study, we report the beneficial effects of these two beta glucans on the biomarkers for cytokine storm and coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients.
Methods: A total of 24 RT PCR positive COVID 19 patients were recruited (Age range: 18~62; 17 males and 7 females). Patients were randomly divided into three groups (Gr): Gr. 1 control (n=8); Gr. 2: AFO-202 beta glucan (n=8); and Gr. 3, a combination of AFO-202 and N-163 beta glucans (n=8). All three groups received the standard care while groups 2 and 3 received additional supplementation of beta glucans for 30 days. In addition to basic clinical parameters, we periodically evaluated D Dimer, IL6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the lymphocyte to CRP ratio (LCR) and the leukocyte CRP ratio (LeCR). 
Results: The duration of hospital stay for all three groups was nearly equivalent. There was no mortality of the subjects in any of the groups. Intermittent oxygen was administered from day of admission for up to four to five days with mask (two to four Lpm) to two subjects in Gr. 2 and one subject in Gr. 3. None of the subjects required ventilation. The D Dimer values in Gr. 1, which was on average 751 ng/ml at baseline, decreased to 143.89 ng/ml on day 15, but increased to 202.5 ng/ml on day 30, which in groups 2 and 3 decreased on day 15 and continued to remain at normal levels until day 30. IL6 levels decreased on day 15 from an average of 7.395 pg/ml to 3.16 pg/ml in the control, 26.18 pg/ml to 6.94 pg/ml in Gr. 2 and 6.25 pg/ml to 5.22 pg/ml in Gr. 3. However, when measured on day 30, in Gr. 1, the IL-6 increased to 55.37 pg/ml while there was only slight marginal increase in Gr. 2 but within normal range, and the levels further decreased to less than 0.5 pg/ml in Gr. 3. The same trend was observed with ESR. LCR and LeCR increased significantly in Gr. 3. NLR decreased significantly in groups 2 and 3. There was no difference in CRP within the groups.
Conclusion:  In this exploratory study, consumption of Aureobasidium pullulans produced beta glucans for thirty days, results in a significant control of IL6, D Dimer and NLR, a significant increase in LCR, LeCR and marginal control of ESR in COVID 19 patients. As these beta glucans are well known food supplements with decades of a track record for safety, based on these results, we recommend larger multi-centric clinical studies to validate their use as an adjunct in the management of COVID-19 and the ensuing long COVID-19 syndrome.</p>",2021-08-14

We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 15 months into the COVID-19 pandemic and six months into the vaccination campaign.
Methods: We conducted a population-based cross-sectional serosurvey between June 1 and July 7, 2021, recruiting participants from age- and sex-stratified random samples of the general population. We tested participants for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting the spike (S) or nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Roche Elecsys immunoassays). We estimated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies seroprevalence following vaccination and/or infection (anti-S antibodies), or infection only (anti-N antibodies).
Results: We included 3355 individuals, of which 1814 (54.1%) were women, 697 (20.8%) were aged &lt;18 years and 449 (13.4%) were aged ≥65 years, 2161 (64.4%) tested positive for anti-S antibodies, and 906 (27.0%) tested positive for anti-N antibodies. The total seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 66.1% (95% credible interval, 64.1-68.0). Considering the presence of anti-N antibodies, we estimated that 29.9% (28.0-31.9) of the population developed antibodies after infection; the rest having developed antibodies only via vaccination. Seroprevalence estimates were similar across sexes, but differed markedly across age groups, being lowest among children aged 0-5 years (20.8% [15.5-26.7]) and highest among older adults aged ≥75 years (93.1% [89.6-96.0]). Seroprevalence of antibodies developed via infection and/or vaccination was higher among participants with a higher educational level.
Conclusions: Most adults have developed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, while most teenagers and children remain vulnerable to infection.

Study design: Multiple bibliographic databases including MEDLINE and Embase, clinical trial registries and further information sources were systematically searched for literature (last bibliographic search: May 7, 2021). Diagnostic cross-sectional or cohort studies that included paediatric study participants and evaluated rapid point-of care tests for diagnosing current SARS-CoV-2 infections against RT-PCR as the reference standard were eligible for inclusion. QUADAS-2 was used to assess the risk of bias and the applicability of the included studies. Bivariate meta-analyses with random effects were performed. Variability was assessed by subgroup analyses. 

Results: We included 17 studies with a total of 6355 paediatric study participants. All included studies compared antigen tests against RT-PCR. Only one study was at low risk of bias. The pooled overall diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in paediatric populations was 64.2% (95% CI: 57.4%-70.5%) and 99.1% (95% CI: 98.2%-99.5%), respectively. In symptomatic children, the pooled diagnostic sensitivity was 71.8% (95% CI: 63.6%-78.8%) and the pooled diagnostic specificity was 98.7% (95% CI: 96.6%-99.5%). The pooled diagnostic sensitivity in asymptomatic children was 56.2% (95% CI: 47.6%-64.4%) and the pooled diagnostic specificity was 98.6% (95% CI: 97.3%-99.3%). 

Conclusions: Performance of current antigen tests under real-life conditions varies broadly. Policymakers should especially be aware of the low diagnostic sensitivity of current antigen tests. Results should be interpreted with caution since risk of bias was predominantly judged as unclear due to poor reporting.

An important step in such analyses is the reliable detection of non-wear time. We observed in light data that days with less wear-time also have lower variability in the light signal, and we sought to test if the standard deviation of the change between subsequent samples can detect this condition. In this study, we propose and validate an easy-to-implement algorithm designed to discriminate between days with a non-wear time &gt;4h (“invalid days”) vs. ≤4h (“valid days”) and investigate to which extent values of commonly used physiologically meaningful light variables differ between invalid days, valid days, and algorithm-selected non-wear days. We used 83 days of light data from a field study with high participant compliance, complemented by 47 days of light data where free-living individuals were instructed not to wear the sensor for varying amounts of time. Light data were recorded every two minutes using the pendant-worn <italic>f.luxomete</italic>r light sensor; validity was derived from daily logs where participants recorded all non-wear time. The algorithm-derived score discriminated well between valid and invalid days (area under the curve (AUC): 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.87). The best cut-off value (<italic>i.e.</italic>, highest Youden index) correctly recognized valid days with a probability of 87% (“sensitivity”), and invalid days with a probability of 63% (“specificity”).

However, these values did not significantly differ when derived across all days compared to self-reported valid days. Our results suggest that our proposed algorithm discriminates well between valid and invalid days. However, in high compliance cohorts, distortions in aggregated light measures of individual-level environmental light recordings across days appear to be small, making the application of our algorithm optional, but not necessary.</p>",2021-08-12

During repeated mild lockdowns, mental and physical symptoms decreased overall, while loneliness increased and social networks decreased. Subgroup analyses revealed that depression and suicidal ideation did not decrease only in the younger age group (aged 18-29) and that younger and middle-aged people (aged 18-49), women, people with a history of treatment for mental illness, and people who were socially disadvantaged in terms of income had higher levels of mental and physical symptoms at all survey times. Additionally, comprehensive extraction of the interaction structure between depression, demographic attributes, and psychosocial variables indicated that loneliness and social networks were most closely associated with depression.

Here, we propose that to achieve this, their brain uses spatial cells similarly to how we utilize encryption for data security. Some animals are able to cache hundreds of thousands of food items annually by each individual and later retrieve most of what they themselves stashed. Rather than memorizing their cache locations as previously suggested, we propose that they use a single cryptographic-like mechanism during both caching and retrieval. The model we developed is based on hippocampal spatial cells, which respond to an animal’s positional attention, such as when the animal enters a specific region (place-cells) or gazes at a particular location (spatial-view-cells). We know that the region that activates each spatial cell remains consistent across subsequent visits to the same area but not between areas. This remapping, combined with the uniqueness of cognitive maps, produces a persistent crypto-hash function for both food caching and retrieval. We also show that the model stores temporal information that helps animals in food caching order preference as previously observed. This behavior, which we refer to as crypto-taxis, might also explain consistent differences in decision-making when animals are faced with a large number of alternatives such as in foraging.</p>",2021-08-11

The first loop, dependent on the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, targets nascent transcripts, and reduces but does not eliminate productive transcription at the locus. The second loop, dependent on the conserved helicase ZNFX-1, targets mature transcripts and concentrates them in perinuclear condensates (nuage). Each amplification loop generates a distinct class of sRNAs, with the ZNFX-1 loop responsible for the bulk of sRNA production on the region targeted by the trigger.

We first demonstrate that enumerating structural variants for a given Boolean specification allows us to find better performing circuits and that stochastic gate assignment methods need to be properly adjusted in order to find the best assignment. Second, we present a general circuit scoring scheme that accounts for the limited accuracy of biological device models including the variability across cells and show that circuits selected according to this score exhibit higher robustness with respect to parametric variations. If gate characteristics in a library are just given in terms of intervals, we provide means to efficiently propagate signals through such a circuit and compute corresponding scores. We demonstrate the novel design approach using the Cello gate library and 33 logic functions that were synthesized and implemented in vivo recently. We show that an average 1.3-fold and a peak 6.5-fold performance increase can be achieved by simply considering structural variants and that an average 1.8-fold and a peak 30-fold gain in the novel robustness score can be obtained when selecting circuits according to it.</p>",2021-08-13

Nonetheless, cellular MTs are formed after experimental depletion of the γ-tubulin complex, suggesting that cells possess other factors that drive MT nucleation. Here, by combining gene knockout, auxin-inducible degron, RNA interference, MT depolymerisation/regrowth assay, and live microscopy, we identified four microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), ch-TOG, CLASP1, CAMSAPs, and TPX2, which are involved in γ-tubulin-independent MT generation in human colon cancer cells. In the mitotic MT regrowth assay, nucleated MTs organised non-centriolar MT organising centres (ncMTOCs) in the absence of γ-tubulin. Depletion of CLASP1 or TPX2 substantially delayed ncMTOC formation, suggesting that they promote MT nucleation in the absence of γ-tubulin. In contrast, depletion of CAMSAPs or ch-TOG did not affect the timing of ncMTOC appearance. CLASP1 also accelerates γ-tubulin-independent MT regrowth during interphase.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have shown impressive clinical success, however, the majority of the patients do not respond to immune checkpoint therapy (ICT). Thus, to overcome ICT resistance there is a high need for potent and novel strategies that simultaneously target both tumor cells and immunosuppressive cells in the TME. In this study, we show that the intracellular light-controlled drug delivery method photochemical internalization (PCI) induce specific and strongly enhanced cytotoxic effects of the PD-L1-targeting immunotoxin, anti-PD-L1-saporin (Anti-PDL1-SAP), in the PD-L1+ triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cell line, while no enhanced efficacy was obtained in the PD-L1 negative control cell line MDA-MB-453. Using fluorescence microscopy, we reveal that the anti-PD-L1 antibody binds to PD-L1 on the surface of the MDA-MD-231 cells and overnight accumulates in late endosomes and lysosomes where it co-localizes with the PCI photosensitizer fimaporfin (TPCS2a). Moreover, light-controlled endosomal/lysosomal escape of the anti-PD-L1 antibody and fimaporfin into the cytosol was obtained. We also confirm that the breast MDA-MB-468 and the prostate PC-3 and DU-145 cancer cell lines have subpopulations with PD-L1 expression.

In conclusion, our work provides an in vitro proof-of-concept of PCI-enhanced targeting and eradication of PD-L1 positive immunosuppressive cells.

We demonstrate the existence of PDCUB in the human transcriptome, and show that it can be used to predict translation-initiating codons with greater accuracy than other models. We further show that observed PDCUB is not accounted for by other common metrics, including position-dependent GC content, consensus sequences, and the presence of signal peptides in the translation product. More importantly, PDCUB defines a spectrum of translational efficiency supported by ribosomal occupancy and tRNA adaptation index (tAI). High PDCUB scores correspond to a tAI-defined translational ramp and low ribosomal occupancy, while low PDCUB scores exhibit a translational valley and the highest ribosomal occupancy. Finally, we examine the relationship between PDCUB intensity and functional enrichment. We find that transcripts with start codons showing the highest PDCUB are enriched for functions relating to the regulation of synaptic signaling and plasticity, as well as skeletal, heart, and nervous-system development. Furthermore, transcripts with high PDCUB are depleted for functions related to immune response and detection of chemical stimulus.

While there is indirect evidence suggesting a peptide, the diazepam binding inhibitor, is capable of modulating the GABA-A receptor, direct evidence of the modulatory effects of the diazepam binding inhibitor is limited.
Here we take a reductionist approach to understand how purified diazepam binding inhibitor interacts with and affects GABA-A receptor activity. We used two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology to study how the effects of diazepam binding inhibitor vary with GABA-A receptor subunit composition, and found that GABA-evoked currents from α3-containing GABA-A receptors are weakly inhibited by the diazepam binding inhibitor, while currents from α5-containing receptors are positively modulated.

Although the nature and degree of sex-biased gene expression has been well-documented in several animal and plant systems,  far less is known about the commonality, conservation, recruitment mechanisms and evolution of sex-biased genes in  more distant eukaryotic groups. Brown algae are of particular interest for empirical studies on the evolution of sex-biased gene expression, as they have been evolving independently from animals and plants for over one billion years. Here we focus on two brown algal dioecious species, Fucus serratus and Fucus vesiculosus, where male heterogamety (XX/XY) has recently emerged.  Using RNA-seq, we study sex-biased gene expression and discuss different evolutionary forces responsible for the evolution of sex-biased genes. We find that both species evolved masculinized transcriptomes, with sex-biased genes allocated mainly to male reproductive tissue, but  virtually absent in vegetative tissues. Conserved male-biased genes were enriched in functions related to gamete production, along with sperm competition and include two flagellar proteins under positive selection. In contrast to female-biased genes, which show high turnover rates, male-biased genes reveal remarkable conservation of bias and expression levels between the two species. As observed in other XY systems, male-biased genes also display accelerated rates of coding sequence evolution compared to female-biased or unbiased genes. Our results imply that evolutionary forces affect male and female sex-biased genes differently on structural and regulatory levels.

Systematic, long-term, and spatially representative monitoring of insecticide resistance in mosquito populations is urgently needed to quantify its impact on malaria transmission, and to combat failing interventions when resistance emerges. Resistance assays on wild-caught adult mosquitoes (known as adult-capture) offer an alternative to the current protocols, and can be done cheaply, in a shorter time frame, and in the absence of an insectary. However, quantitative assessments of the performance of these assays relative to the gold standard, which involves rearing larvae in an insectary, are lacking.

Methodology/Principal findings

We developed a discrete-time deterministic mosquito lifecycle model to simulate insecticide resistance assays from adult-captured mosquito collection in a heterogeneous environment compared to the gold standard larval capture methods, and to quantify possible biases in the results. We incorporated non-lethal effects of insecticide exposure that have been demonstrated in laboratory experiments, spatial structure, and the impact of multiple exposure to insecticides and natural ageing on mosquito death rates during the assay. Using output from this model, we compared the results of these assays to true resistance as measured by the presence of the resistance allele. In simulated samples of 100 test mosquitoes, reflecting WHO-recommended sample sizes, we found that compared to adult-captured assays (MSE = 0.0059), larval-captured assays were a better measure of true resistance (MSE = 0.0018). Using a correction model, we were able to improve the accuracy of the adult-captured assay results (MSE = 0.0038). Bias in the adult-capture assays was dependent on the level of insecticide resistance rather than coverage of bed nets or spatial structure.

Conclusions/Significance

Using adult-captured mosquitoes for resistance assays has logistical advantages over the standard larval-capture collection, and may be a more accurate sample of the mosquito population. These results show that adult-captured assays can be improved using a simple mathematical approach and used to inform resistance monitoring programs.</p>",2021-08-13

Community surveys of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR swab-positivity provide prevalence estimates largely unaffected by biases from who presents for routine case testing. The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1(REACT-1) has estimated swab-positivity approximately monthly since May 2020 in England from RT-PCR testing of self-administered throat and nose swabs in random non-overlapping cross-sectional community samples. Estimating infection incidence from swab-positivity requires an understanding of the persistence of RT-PCR swab positivity in the community.

Methods
During round 8 of REACT-1 from 6 January to 22 January 2021, of the 2,282 participants who tested RT-PCR positive, we recruited 896 (39%)  from whom we collected up to two additional swabs for RT-PCR approximately 6 and 9 days after the initial swab. We estimated sensitivity and duration of positivity using an exponential model of positivity decay, for all participants and for subsets by initial N-gene cycle threshold (Ct) value, symptom status, lineage and age. Estimates of infection incidence were obtained for the entire duration of the REACT-1 study using P-splines. 

Results 
We estimated the overall sensitivity of REACT-1 to detect virus on a single swab as 0.79 (0.77, 0.81) and median duration of positivity following a positive test as 9.7 (8.9, 10.6) days. We found greater median duration of positivity where there was a low N-gene Ct value, in those exhibiting symptoms, or for infection with the Alpha variant. The estimated proportion of positive individuals detected on first swab, P0, was found to be higher for those with an initially low N-gene Ct value and those who were pre-symptomatic. When compared to swab-positivity, estimates of infection incidence over the duration of REACT-1 included sharper features with evident transient increases around the time of key changes in social distancing measures.

Discussion
Home self-swabbing for RT-PCR based on a single swab, as implemented in REACT-1, has high overall sensitivity. However, participants' time-since-infection,  symptom status and viral lineage affect the probability of detection and the duration of positivity. These results validate previous efforts to estimate incidence of SARS-CoV-2 from swab-positivity data, and provide a reliable means to obtain community infection estimates to inform policy response.</p>",2021-08-13

Thirty-nine primer pairs were employed to obtain amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from the complete genomes of 186 bacterial and 135 archaeal species. For each primer, ASVs without mismatches were aligned using BLASTN and their similarity values were obtained. Finally, we selected ASVs from different species with an ASI value ≥97% that were covered 100% by the query sequences. For each primer, the percentage of species-level coverage with no ASI≥97% (SC-NASI≥97%) was calculated.
Based on the SC-NASI≥97% values, the best primer pairs were OP_F053-KP_R020 for bacteria (65.05%), KP_F018-KP_R002 for archaea (51.11%), and OP_F114-KP_R031 for bacteria and archaea together (52.02%). Eighty percent of the oral-bacteria and oral-archaea species shared an ASI≥97% with at least one other taxa, including Campylobacter, Rothia, Streptococcus, and Tannerella, which played conflicting roles in the oral microbiota. Moreover, around a quarter and a third of these two-by-two similarity relationships were between species from different bacteria and archaea genera, respectively. Furthermore, even taxa from distinct families, orders, and classes could be grouped in the same cluster. 
Consequently, irrespective of the primer pair used, OTUs constructed with a 97% similarity provide an inaccurate description of oral-bacterial and oral-archaeal species, greatly affecting microbial diversity parameters. As a result, clustering by OTUs impacts the credibility of the associations between some oral species and certain health and disease conditions. This limits significantly the comparability of the microbial diversity findings reported in oral microbiome literature.</p>",2021-08-09

For a protein sequence, there are many methods to generate a SA. However, when given a choice of more than one SA for a protein sequence, there are no methods to predict which SA may lead to more accurate models without actually building the models. In this work, we describe a method to predict the quality of a protein's SA. Methods: We created our own dataset by generating a variety of SAs for a set of 1,351 representative proteins and investigated various deep learning architectures to predict the local distance difference test (lDDT) scores of distance maps predicted with SAs as the input. These lDDT scores serve as indicators of the quality of the SAs. Results: Using two independent test datasets consisting of CASP13 and CASP14 targets, we show that our method is effective for scoring and ranking SAs when a pool of SAs is available for a protein sequence. With an example, we further discuss that SA selection using our method can lead to improved structure prediction.</p>",2021-08-15

By single cell analysis, we showed that a gradient of FGF signaling regulates demarcation and subdivision of the CM and controls its stem cell-like property of self-renewal, differentiation and survival. This regulation by FGF is balanced by an evolutionarily conserved Wnt signaling gradient induced by the lens ectoderm and the periocular mesenchyme, which specifies the CM and the distal RPE. These two morphogen gradients converge in the CM where FGF signaling promotes Wnt signaling by stabilizing β-catenin in a GSK3β-independent manner. We further showed that activation of Wnt signaling converts the NR to either the CM or the RPE depending on the level of FGF signaling. Conversely, activation of FGF transforms the RPE to the NR or CM dependent on Wnt activity. We demonstrated that the default fate of the eye cup is the NR, but synergistic FGF and Wnt signaling promotes CM formation both in vivo and in retinal organoid culture of human iPS cells. Our study reveals that the vertebrate eye develops through phase transition determined by a combinatorial code of FGF and Wnt signaling.</p>",2021-08-13

This novel approach allows us to examine the binding properties of diverse peptides. The unique stability of our MHC class I even enables us to determine the binding affinity of complexes, which are suboptimally loaded with truncated or charge-reduced peptides. Notably, a unique erucamide adduct decouples affinity analysis from peptide identity alleviating issues usually attributed to clustering. We discovered that two anchor positions at the binding surface between MHC and peptide can be stabilized independently and further analyze the contribution of other peptidic amino acids on the binding. We propose this as an alternative, likely universally applicable method to artificial prediction tools to estimate the binding strength of peptides to MHC class I complexes quickly and efficiently.

In this study, we built a low-cost greenhouse-based HTP platform to collect growth-related image-derived phenotypes. We assessed 360 inbred maize lines with or without PGPB inoculation under nitrogen-limited conditions.

A plant biomass index was constructed as a function of plant height and canopy coverage. Inoculation with PGPB promoted plant growth. Phenotypic correlations between the image-derived phenotypes and manual measurements were at least 0.6. The genomic heritability estimates of the image-derived phenotypes ranged from 0.23 to 0.54. Moderate-to-strong genomic correlations between the plant biomass index and shoot dry mass (0.24-0.47) and between HTP-based plant height and manually measured plant height (0.55-0.68) across the developmental stages showed the utility of our HTP platform.

Methods: HIV-positive individuals (n=121) were recruited from HIV clinics in Montreal and stratified according to their CD4 counts. A control group of 20 health care workers naive to SARS CoV-2 was used. The participants Anti-RBD IgG responses were measured by ELISA at baseline and 3 to 4 weeks after receiving the first dose of an mRNA vaccine.
Results: Eleven of 121 participants had anti-COVID-19 antibodies at baseline, and a further 4 had incomplete data for the analysis. Mean anti-RBD IgG responses were similar between between the HIV negative control group (n=20) and the combined HIV+ group (n=106) (p = 0.72).

In both study regions, the chemical composition of DOM correlated with bacterial communities, and was primarily controlled by nutrients and to a lesser degree by temperature. At a molecular-level, DOM-bacteria associations depended strongly on the molecular traits of DOM, with negative associations indicative of decomposition as molecules are more biolabile. Using bipartite networks, we further demonstrated that negative associations were more specialized than positive associations indicative of DOM production. Nutrient enrichment promoted specialization of positive associations, but decreased specialization of negative associations particularly at warmer temperatures in subtropical climate. These global change drivers influenced specialization of negative associations most strongly via molecular traits, while both molecular traits and bacterial diversity similarly affected positive associations.

Richards'}]","<p>Forgetting is a normal process in healthy brains, and evidence suggests that the mammalian brain forgets more than is required based on limitations of mnemonic capacity. Episodic memories, in particular, are liable to be forgotten over time. Researchers have hypothesized that it may be beneficial for decision making to forget episodic memories over time. Reinforcement learning offers a normative framework in which to test such hypotheses. Here, we show that a reinforcement learning agent that uses an episodic memory cache to find rewards in maze environments can forget a large percentage of older memories without any performance impairments, if they utilize mnemonic representations that contain structural information about space. Moreover, we show that some forgetting can actually provide a benefit in performance compared to agents with unbounded memories. Our analyses of the agents show that forgetting reduces the influence of outdated information and states which are not frequently visited on the policies produced by the episodic control system. These results support the hypothesis that some degree of forgetting can be beneficial for decision making, which can help to explain why the brain forgets more than is required by capacity limitations.</p>",2021-08-12

Here, we studied the simple spike activity of Purkinje cells in the mid-lateral cerebellum when monkeys learned to associate a right or left-hand movement with one of two visual symbolic cues. These cells had distinctly different discharge patterns between an overtrained symbol-hand association and a novel symbol-hand association, responding in association with the movement of both hands, although the kinematics of the movement did not change between the two conditions. The activity change was not related to the pattern of the visual symbols, the movement kinematics, the monkeys’ reaction times or the novelty of the visual symbols. The simple spike activity changed with throughout the learning process, but the concurrent complex spikes did not instruct that change. Although these neurons also have reward-related activity, the reward-related and movement-related signals were independent.

Immunocompromised patients are at risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 and are considered a high priority for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination. Humoral vaccination response is impaired in these patients when circulating B cells are lacking. We aimed to analyze B-cell subsets at the time of vaccination to identify potential predictors of humoral vaccination response. 
Methods 
Patients (n=120) receiving B-cell-depleting therapy (n=41), those suffering from inborn errors of immunity (n=25) and hematologic malignancies (n=56), and healthy controls (n=79) were vaccinated twice with BNT162b2 or mRNA 1273. B-cell subsets were analyzed prior to vaccination. Two independent anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassays targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or trimeric S protein (TSP) were performed three to four weeks after the second vaccination.
Results 
Seroconversion occurred in 100% of the healthy controls, in contrast to 67% (RBD) and 82% (TSP) of the patients, while only 32% (RBD) and 22% (TSP) achieved antibody levels comparable to those of healthy controls. The number of circulating naive B cell was strongly associated with antibody levels (r=0.761, P&lt;0.001) across all immunosuppressive treatments or conditions. In multivariable analysis, the number of naive B cells was an independent predictor for achieving antibody levels comparable to healthy controls, and receiver operating characteristic analysis predicted that at least six naive B cells per microL were required.
Conclusions 
Assessing the abundance of naive B cells in immunocompromised patients could be useful in predicting the optimal vaccination response.</p>",2021-08-13

We assume the existence of behavioral and neural automaticity for humanoid robots that were previously only evident for evolutionary threats. Here, we observed a monocular advantage for the perception of humanoid robots the same as an evolutionary threat (i.e., snakes). Our neuroimaging analysis indicated that unconscious presentation of humanoid robot vs. human images led to significant left amygdala activation that was associated with negative implicit attitude to humanoid robots. After successfully weakening negative attitude, the left amygdala response to unconscious presentation of humanoid robot images decreased, and the decrease of left amygdala response was positively associated with the decrease of negative attitude. Our results reveal that processing of information about humanoid robots displays automaticity with regard to recruitment of visual pathway and amygdala activation.

Background: Since December 2020, public health agencies have implemented a variety of vaccination strategies to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2, along with pre-existing Nonpharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs). Initial strategy focused on vaccinating the elderly to prevent hospitalizations and deaths. With vaccines becoming available to the broader population, we aimed to determine the optimal strategy to enable the safe lifting of NPIs while avoiding virus resurgence. 
Methods: We developed a compartmental deterministic SEIR model to simulate the lifting of NPIs under different vaccination rollout scenarios. Using case and vaccination data from Toronto, Canada between December 28, 2020 and May 19, 2021, we estimated transmission throughout past stages of NPI escalation/relaxation to compare the impact of lifting NPIs on different dates on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, given varying degrees of vaccine coverages by 20-year age groups, accounting for waning immunity.  
Results: We found that, once coverage among the elderly is high enough (80% with at least one dose), the main age groups to target are 20-39 and 40-59 years, whereby first-dose coverage of at least 70% by mid-June 2021 is needed to minimize the possibility of resurgence if NPIs are to be lifted in the summer. While a resurgence was observed for every scenario of NPI lifting, we also found that under an optimistic vaccination coverage (70% by mid-June, postponing reopening from August 2021 to September 2021can reduce case counts and severe outcomes by roughly 80% by December 31, 2021. 
Conclusions: Our results suggest that focusing the vaccination strategy on the working-age population can curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, even with high vaccination coverage in adults, lifting NPIs to pre-pandemic levels is not advisable since a resurgence is expected to occur, especially with earlier reopening.</p>",2021-08-13

However, birds and mammals display an appetite for information that they cannot use to functionally alter behaviour or its outcomes. We explore two putative motivational mechanisms for this paradoxical behaviour. The information hypothesis proposes that reducing uncertainty is reinforcing <italic>per se</italic>, consistent with the concept of curiosity: a motivation to know, in the absence of instrumental benefits. In contrast, the conditioned reinforcement hypothesis sees information-seeking as a consequence of asymmetries in secondarily acquired reinforcement: responding increments caused by post-choice stimuli announcing positive outcomes (S<sup>+</sup>) exceed decrements caused by stimuli signalling absence of reward (S<sup>−</sup>). We contrast these hypotheses experimentally. Rats chose between two equally profitable options delivering food probabilistically after a fixed delay. In the informative option (<italic>Info</italic>), the outcome (food/no food) was signalled immediately after choice, whereas in the non-informative option (<italic>NoInfo</italic>) outcomes were uncertain until the delay lapsed. Subjects preferred (<italic>Info</italic>) when (1) outcomes were signalled by salient auditory cues, (2) only the absence of reward was signalled, and (3) only reward was signalled, though acquisition was slower when rewards were not explicitly signalled. Our results show that a salient good news signal is not required as a conditioned reinforcer to generate paradoxical preferences. Terminal preferences support the information hypothesis but the slower acquisition of (<italic>Info</italic>) preference when S<sup>+</sup> is not present is consistent with the conditioning account. We conclude that both uncertainty reduction and conditioned reinforcement influence choice.</p>",2021-08-13

These tumors have an extremely poor prognosis. MM accounts for 4% of skin cancers with an 80% mortality rate. The median survival of patients with metastatic melanoma is approximately six months, with a five-year survival rate of less than 10%. In recent years, the incidence of melanoma has gradually increased and has become one of the deadliest cancers. Competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) models the mechanism by which long chain non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a regulatory role in the disease. LncRNAs can act as a sponge, competitively attracting small RNAs (micoRNAs; miRNAs) and interfering with miRNA function. This can affect the expression of target gene messenger RNAs (mRNAs), ultimately promoting tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Bioinformatics analysis may identify potentially prognostic and therapeutically-relevant differentially expressed genes in MM, as well as lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs that are interconnected through the ceRNA network. This may provide further insight into gene regulation and the prognosis of metastatic melanoma. Weighted co-expression networks were used to identify lncRNA and mRNA modules associated with the metastatic phenotype, as well as the co-expression genes contained in the modules. We used 17 lncRNAs, six miRNAs, and 11 mRNAs to construct a ceRNA interaction network with a regulatory role in patients with metastatic melanoma. The prognostic risk model was used as a sorter to classify the survival prognosis of melanoma patients. Four groups of ceRNA interaction triplets were obtained, and miR-3662 may be used in the treatment of metastatic melanoma patients. Experiments confirmed the regulating relationship and phenotype of this assumption. This study provides new targets to regulate the metastatic process, predict metastatic potential and determine that miR-3662 may be used in the treatment of melanoma.</p>",2021-08-09

Although previous work has revealed important interconnections between autophagy and EVP-mediated secretion, our molecular understanding of these secretory events during endolysosome inhibition remains incomplete. Here, we delineate a secretory autophagy pathway upregulated in response to endolysosomal inhibition that mediates the EVP-associated extracellular release of autophagic cargo receptors, including p62/SQSTM1. This extracellular secretion is highly regulated and critically dependent on multiple ATGs required for the progressive steps of early autophagosome formation as well as Rab27a-dependent exocytosis. Furthermore, the disruption of autophagosome maturation, either due to genetic inhibition of the autophagosome-to-autolyosome fusion machinery or blockade via the SARS-CoV2 viral protein ORF3a, is sufficient to induce robust EVP-associated secretion of autophagy cargo receptors. Finally, we demonstrate that this ATG-dependent, EVP-mediated secretion pathway buffers against the intracellular accumulation of autophagy cargo receptors when classical autophagic degradation is impaired. Based on these results, we propose that secretory autophagy via EVPs functions as an alternate route to clear sequestered material and maintain proteostasis in response to endolysosomal dysfunction or impaired autophagosome maturation.</p>",2021-08-12

The 33 ms and 83 ms time intervals were chosen to occur shortly before and after a predicted 60 ms visual escape latency (i.e. during Stage 1). The 0 ms and 33 ms treatments influenced both the escape trajectory and the Stage 1 turning angle, compared to a single stimulation, whereas the 83 ms treatment had no effect on the escape response.

Methods: Through case-cohort sampling, participants were selected for measurement of four serum antibody markers at Day 1 (first dose), Day 29 (second dose), and Day 57: IgG binding antibodies (bAbs) to Spike, bAbs to Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), and 50% and 80% inhibitory dilution pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titers calibrated to the WHO International Standard (cID50 and cID80).

Results: Day 57 Spike IgG, RBD IgG, cID50, and cID80 neutralization levels were each inversely correlated with risk of COVID-19: hazard ratios 0.66 (95% CI 0.50, 0.88; p=0.005); 0.57 (0.40, 0.82; p=0.002); 0.42 (0.27, 0.65; p&lt;0.001); 0.35 (0.20, 0.61; p&lt;0.001) per 10-fold increase in marker level, respectively, multiplicity adjusted P-values 0.003-0.010.

However, while structures of mature fibrils have been studied, the structural distributions in early stage tau aggregates is not well understood. In the present study, we use AFM-IR to investigate nanoscale spectra of individual tau fibrils at different stages of aggregation and demonstrate the presence of multiple fibrillar polymorphs that exhibit different secondary structures. We further show that mature fibrils contain significant amounts of antiparallel beta sheets. Our results are the very first application of nanoscale infrared spectroscopy to tau aggregates and underscore the promise of spatially resolved infrared spectroscopy for investigating protein aggregation.</p>",2021-08-13

Unfortunately, conservationists often lack information on species distribution, how to differentiate between similar species, and environmental conditions associated with the presence of a species. We addressed these problems using two “sister” species of fish, the Mottled Sculpin (<italic>Cottus bairdii</italic>) and the Slimy Sculpin (<italic>Cottus cognatus</italic>), as stream quality indicators in the Manistee River watershed in the Huron-Manistee National Forests in Michigan, USA. We determined the abundance and distribution of these species and related their presence to concurrent in-stream measurements of temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, turbidity, and stream quality score based on macroinvertebrate diversity. To be certain of identification, we sequenced the Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunit I (CO1) molecular marker for specimens and used it as a DNA barcode to determine a specimen’s species. Cladistic analyses of CO1 unambiguously supported recognition of Mottled Sculpin and Slimy Sculpin as distinct species, confirming initial 87.5% correct identification using morphological characteristics, with uncertainty limited to juvenile fish. Field determinations increased to 100% correct identification as investigators gained more experience. Both species were most abundant in headwater regions, decreased downstream, and were sympatric at several locations. Mottled Sculpin were more likely to be found at stream locations with lower conductivity, pH, and stream quality scores, whereas Slimy Sculpin presence was more strongly associated higher levels of DO and lower levels of turbidity. Such findings are important because Mottled Sculpin are a designated management indicator species of the US Forest Service in the Huron-Manistee National Forests, but may be ineffective as a habitat quality indicator when used alone. Concurrent use of Mottled Sculpin and Slimy Sculpin as a management indicator sister-species complex could allow sufficient landscape coverage to permit habitat assessment if species-specific differences in environmental tolerances are precisely determined.</p>",2021-08-12

To generate MCC, these kinetochores recruit MCC constituent proteins including the protein BubR1. The increased local concentration of BubR1 resulting from this recruitment should enhance MCC generation, but prior studies found this not to be the case. We analyzed the contribution of two BubR1 recruitment pathways to MCC generation in human kinetochores. For these analyses, we isolated a subset of the MCC generation reactions to the cytosol using ectopic SAC activation systems. These analyses and mathematical modeling show that BubR1 binding to the SAC protein Bub1, but not to the ‘KI’ motifs in the kinetochore protein Knl1, significantly enhances the rate of Bub1-mediated MCC generation in the kinetochore. Our work also suggests that Bub1-BubR1 stoichiometry will strongly influence the dose-response characteristics of SAC signaling.</p>",2021-08-12

Here, we compared different dCas9-VP64 constructs in identical contexts, including the cell lines used and the transfection conditions, for their ability to activate endogenous and exogenous genes. Moreover, we investigated the optimal approach for VP64 addition to VP64- and p300-based constructs.

The study of malaria infection during pregnancy is particularly reliant on mouse models, as a means of circumventing many challenges and costs associated with pregnancy studies in endemic human populations. Here, we introduce three novel murine models that will further our understanding of how post-implantation and midgestional malaria infection affects pregnancy outcomes. When C57BL/6J (B6) mice are infected with  Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi  AS on either embryonic day (E) 6.5, 8.5, or 10.5, preterm birth occurs in all animals by E16.5, E17.5, or E18.5 respectively, with no evidence of intrauterine growth restriction. We found that the time to delivery, placental inflammatory and antioxidant transcript upregulation, and the relationships between parasitemia and transcript expression prior to preterm birth are different based on the embryonic day of infection. On the day before preterm delivery, E6.5 infected mice did not experience significant upregulation of the inflammatory or antioxidant gene transcripts examined; however, parasitemia correlated positively with  Il1β  ,  Cox1  , and  Hmox1  placental transcript abundance. E8.5 infected mice had elevated transcripts for  Ifn  g  ,  Tnf  ,  Il10  ,  Cox1  ,  Cox2  ,  Sod1  ,  Sod2  ,  Cat  , and  Nrf2  , while  Sod3  was the only transcript that correlated with parasitemia. Finally, E10.5 infected mice had elevated transcripts for  Ifn  g  only, with a tendency for  Tnf  transcripts to correlate with parasitemia. Tumor necrosis factor deficient (TNF  -/-  ) and TNF receptor 1 deficient (TNFR1  -/-  ) mice infected on E8.5 experienced preterm birth at the same time as B6 controls. Further characterization of these models is necessary to discover new and/or existing mechanism(s) or trigger(s) responsible for malaria-driven preterm birth that is determined by gestational age upon maternal infection, parasite-host dynamics, or both.</p>",2021-08-13

National data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and knowledge on associated risk factors are important for understanding the course of the pandemic. Testing Denmark is a national large-scale epidemiological surveillance study of SARS-CoV-2 in the Danish population. 

Methods
Between September and October 2020, approximately 1.3 million of 5.8 million Danish citizens (age &gt; 15 years) were randomly invited to fill in an electronic questionnaire covering COVID-19 exposures and symptoms. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was determined by Point-of Care rapid Test (POCT) distributed to participants home addresses. 

Findings
In total 318,552 participants (24.5% invitees) completed the questionnaire and provided the result of the POCT. Of these, 2,519 (0.79%) were seropositive (median age 55 years) and women were more often seropositive than men, interquartile range (IQR) 42-64, 40.2% males. Of participants with a prior positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test (n=1,828), 29.1% were seropositive in the POCT. Seropositivity increased with age irrespective of sex. Elderly participants (&gt;61 years) reported less symptoms and had less frequently been tested for SARS-CoV-2 compared to younger participants. Seropositivity was associated with physical contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (Risk ratio (RR) 7.43, 95% CI: 6.57-8.41) and in particular household members (RR 17.70, 95% CI: 15.60-20.10). Home care workers had a higher risk of seropositivity (RR 2.09 (95% CI: 1.58-2.78) as compared to office workers. Geographic population density was not associated to seropositivity. A high degree of compliance with national preventive recommendations was reported (e.g., &gt; 80% use of face masks), but no difference was found between seropositive and seronegative participants.

Interpretation
This study provides insight into the immunity of the Danish population seven to eight months after the first COVID-19 case in Denmark. The seroprevalence was lower than expected probably due to a low sensitivity of the POCT used or due to challenges relating to the reading of test results. Occupation or exposure in local communities were major routes of infection. As elderly participants were more often seropositive despite fewer symptoms and less PCR tests performed, more emphasis should be placed on testing this age group.</p>",2021-08-13

A soluble TREM2 isoform (sTREM2) is elevated in cerebrospinal fluid in the early stages of AD suggesting it may be a biomarker of progressive alterations in immune response to AD-related pathology. Multiple studies have reported an altered peripheral immune response in AD. However, less is known about the relationship between plasma sTREM2 and the altered peripheral immune response in AD. The objective of this exploratory study was to examine the relationship between sTREM2 and inflammatory activity in human participants defined by clinically characterized cognitive symptoms and groups defined by the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers <underline>a</underline>myloid beta, phosphorylated <underline>t</underline>au, and <underline>n</underline>eurodegeneration (NIA-AA Research Framework: “ATN continuum”.) The hypothesis of this exploratory study was that sTREM2 related inflammatory activity differs by AD stage. We observed different patterns of inflammatory activity across disease groups and ATN categories that implicates peripheral sTREM2 related inflammatory activity as altered in the early stages of AD. Notably, fractalkine showed a significant relationship with sTREM2 across different analyses in the control groups that was lost as disease progressed, and fractalkine, IL-5 and IL-17A were decreased in AD. These preliminary data provide important support to the hypothesis that sTREM2-related inflammatory activity is a stage-specific biomarker of AD progression, providing the groundwork for future studies and therapeutic strategies.</p>",2021-08-12

Job losses have been widespread, and individuals have experienced significant restrictions on their usual activities, including extended isolation from family and friends. While studies suggest population mental health worsened from before the pandemic, not all individuals appear to have experienced poorer mental health. This raises the question of how people managed to cope during the pandemic. Methods: To understand the coping strategies individuals employed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we used structural topic modelling, a text mining technique, to extract themes from free-text data on coping from over 11,000 UK adults, collected between 14 October and 26 November 2020. Results: We identified 16 topics. The most discussed coping strategy was 'thinking positively' and involved themes of gratefulness and positivity. Other strategies included engaging in activities and hobbies (such as doing DIY, exercising, walking and spending time in nature), keeping routines, and focusing on one day at a time. Some participants reported more avoidant coping strategies, such as drinking alcohol and binge eating. Coping strategies varied by respondent characteristics including age, personality traits and sociodemographic characteristics and some coping strategies, such as engaging in creative activities, were associated with more positive lockdown experiences. Conclusion: A variety of coping strategies were employed by individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The coping strategy an individual adopted was related to their overall lockdown experiences.

Since, the infection crossed geographical barriers, the WHO permanently named the causing disease as COVID-2019 by declaring it a pandemic situation. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus causing a wide range of pathological conditions from common cold symptoms to pneumonia and fatal severe respiratory syndrome. Genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has revealed 96% identity to the bat coronavirus and 79.6% sequence identity to the previous SARS-CoV. The main protease (known as 3C-like proteinase/ Mpro) plays a vital role during the infection with the processing of replicase polyprotein thus offering an attractive target for therapeutic interventions. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro shares 97% sequence identity, with 12 variable residues but none of them present in the catalytic and substrate binding site. With the high level of sequence and structural similarity and absence of any drug/vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, drug repurposing against Mpro is an effective strategy to combat COVID-19. Here, we report a detailed comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with SARS-CoV Mpro using molecular dynamics simulations to assess the impact of 12 divergent residues on the molecular microenvironment of Mpro. A structural comparison and analysis is made on how these variable residues affects the intra-molecular interactions between key residues in the monomer and biologically active dimer form of Mpro. The present MD simulations study concluded the change in microenvironment of active-site residues at the entrance (T25, T26, M49 and Q189), near the catalytic region (F140, H163, H164, M165 and H172) and other residues in substrate binding site (V35T, N65S, K88R and N180K) due to 12 mutation incorporated in the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. It is also evident that SARS-CoV-2 dimer is more stable and less flexible state compared to monomer which may be due to these variable residues, mainly F140, E166 and H172 which are involved in dimerization. This also warrants a need for inhibitor design considering the more stable dimer form. The mutation accumulated in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro indirectly reconfigures the key molecular networks around the active site conferring a potential change in SARS-CoV-2, thus posing a challenge in drug repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19. The new networks and changes in microenvironment identified by our work might guide attempts needed for repurposing and identification of new Mpro inhibitors.</p>",2021-08-11

Rapid AST methods under development often trade speed for resolution, sometimes only measuring responses at a single antibiotic concentration. QuickMIC is a recently developed lab-on-a-chip system for rapid AST. Here we evaluate the performance of the QuickMIC method with regard to speed, precision and accuracy in comparison to traditional diagnostic methods. 151 blood cultures of clinical Gram-negative isolates with a high frequency of drug resistance were tested with the QuickMIC system and compared with BMD for 12 antibiotics. To investigate sample turnaround time and functionality in a clinical setting, another 41 clinical blood culture samples were acquired from the Uppsala University Hospital and analyzed on site in the clinical laboratory with the QuickMIC system, and compared with DDM for 8 antibiotics routinely used in the clinical laboratory. The overall essential agreement between MIC values obtained by QuickMIC and BMD was 83.2%, with an average time to result of 3 h 2 min (SD: 24.8 min) for the QuickMIC method. For the clinical dataset, the categorical agreement was 94.9%, and the total turnaround time as compared to routine diagnostics reduced by 40% (33 h vs. 55 h).

Recently, using spFRET (single pair Foerster/Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer), we showed that the globular domain (gH) of Xenopus laevis H1.0b LH  orients towards A-tracts present on the linker-DNA (L-DNA) in LH:mononucleosome complexes. We investigated the impact of this A-tract mediated orientation of the gH on the compaction of higher-order structures by studying trinucleosomes as minimal models for chromatin. Two 600 bp DNA sequences were constructed containing three Widom 601 core sequences separated by about 40 bp linkers and A-tracts inserted on either the outer or the inner L-DNAs flanking the 1st and the 3rd Widom 601 sequences. The two inner L-DNAs were fluorescently labelled at their midpoints. Trinucleosomes were reconstituted using the doubly-labelled 600 bp DNA, core histone octamers and the full-length H1.0b LH. SpFRET was performed for a range of NaCl concentrations. While the LH compacted the trinucleosomes, surprisingly, the extent of compaction was similar for trinucleosomes with A-tracts either on the two outer or on the two inner L-DNAs. Modeling constrained by the FRET efficiency suggests that the trinucleosomes adopt a zig-zagged conformation with the 1st and 3rd nucleosomes stacked on top of each other. Even though we expect that the gH of neighbouring (1st and 3rd) LHs are oriented towards the A-tracts, our models suggest that they are not sufficiently close to dimerize and affect compaction. Thus, despite differences in A-tract placements, the LH compacts trinucleosomes similarly.</p>",2021-08-13

Methods: An online survey was conducted among adults in Israel (n=461), immediately after the first COVID-19 vaccine became available (22/12/2020 to 10/1/2021). Two regressions were performed to investigate determinants of intention to receive the available COVID-19 vaccine and sense of urgency to receive the vaccine. 
Results: Although many adults were willing to receive available COVID-19 vaccine, only 65% were willing to immediately receive the vaccine, 16% preferred to wait 3 months and 18% preferred to wait a year. The sense of urgency to get vaccinated differed by age, periphery level, perceived barriers, cues to action and availability. Incentives such as monetary rewards or the green pass did not increase the probability of getting vaccination immediately.
Conclusions: Providing data on the role of incentives in increasing the intention to immediately receive the available COVID-19 vaccine is important for health policy makers and healthcare providers. Our findings underscore the importance of COVID-19 vaccine accessibility.

One of the suggested functions of the oscillations is to dynamically modulate communication between neural circuits. The Communication Through Coherence (CTC) theory establishes that oscillations reflect rhythmic changes in excitability of the neuronal populations. Thus, populations need to be properly phase-locked so that input volleys arrive at the peaks of excitability of the receiving population to communicate effectively. Here, we present a modeling study to explore synchronization between neuronal circuits connected with unidirectional projections. We consider an Excitatory-Inhibitory (E-I) network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons modeling a Pyramidal-Interneuronal Network Gamma (PING) rhythm. The network receives an external periodic input from either one or two sources, simulating the inputs from other oscillating neural groups. We use recently developed mean-field models which provide an exact description of the macroscopic activity of the spiking network. This low-dimensional mean field model allows us to use tools from bifurcation theory to identify the phase-locked states between the input and the target population as a function of the amplitude, frequency and coherence of the inputs. We identify the conditions for optimal phaselocking and selective communication. We find that inputs with high coherence can entrain the network for a wider range of frequencies. Besides, faster oscillatory inputs than the intrinsic network gamma cycle show more effective communication than inputs with similar frequency. Our analysis further shows that the entrainment of the network by inputs with higher frequency is more robust to distractors, thus giving them an advantage to entrain the network. Finally, we show that pulsatile inputs can switch between attended inputs in selective attention.</p>",2021-08-13

The present study aims at clarifying the rational of such changes from childhood to adulthood and in ageing by comparing the impacted cognitive processes across age groups. More precisely, the aim was to clarify if all processes take more time to be executed, hence implying that longer latencies rely mainly on processing speed or if an additional process lengthens the resolution of the conflict in children and/or older adults. To this aim we recorded brain electrical activity using EEG in school-age children, young and older adults while they performed a classic verbal Stroop task. To decompose the signal in the underlying brain networks, we used microstates analyses and compared congruent, incongruent and neutral trials across the three age-groups. Behaviorally, children and older adults presented longer latencies and larger Stroop effects relative to young adults. The microstates results showed that children tend to present different brain configurations compared to both adult groups, even though some brain configurations remained identical among the three groups. In particular, additional brain networks were involved in children to perform the Stroop task, which party account for the longer latencies in this group. By contrast, in aging the results favor the general slowing hypothesis rather than a decline in a specific process since all involved brain networks were similar in the two adult groups but slowed down in the older one.</p>",2021-08-13

These findings suggest that, unlike mycorrhizal fungi, RAF communities are less sensitive to shifts in soil nutrient availability.

However, in a large population, multiple beneficial mutants can emerge before any of them fixes in the population. Competition between mutants is known as clonal interference, and how it affects the form of long-term fitness trajectories in the presence of epistasis is an open question. Here, by considering how changes in fixation probabilities arising from weak clonal interference affect the dynamics of adaptation on fitness-parameterized landscapes, we find that the change in the form of fitness trajectory arises only through changes in the supply of beneficial mutations (or equivalently, the beneficial mutation rate). Furthermore, a depletion of beneficial mutations as a population climbs up the fitness landscape can speed up the functional form of the fitness trajectory, while an enhancement of the beneficial mutation rate does the opposite of slowing down the form of the dynamics. Our findings suggest that by carrying out evolution experiments in both regimes (with and without clonal interference), one could potentially distinguish the different sources of macroscopic epistasis (fitness effect of mutations vs. change in fraction of beneficial mutations).</p>",2021-08-13

Using a cooperatively breeding fish, the daffodil cichlid (<italic>Neolamprologus pulcher</italic>), we conducted the first experimental test of the effects of chronic outgroup conflict on reproductive investment and output. ‘Intruded’ groups received long-term simulated territorial intrusions by neighbours that generated consistent group-defence behaviour; matched ‘Control’ groups (each the same size and with the same neighbours as an Intruded group) received no intrusions in the same period. Intruded groups had longer inter-clutch intervals and produced eggs with less protein than Control groups. Despite this lower egg investment, Intruded groups provided more parental care, achieving similar hatching success to Control groups. Ultimately, however, Intruded groups had fewer and smaller surviving offspring than Control groups at 1-month post-hatching. We therefore provide experimental evidence that outgroup conflict can decrease fitness via cumulative effects on reproductive success, confirming the selective potential of this empirically neglected aspect of sociality.</p>",2021-08-12

One intuitive possibility is that these preferences are driven by semantic knowledge: For example, when we recognize a sofa, we access our knowledge about its real-world size, and this influences what size we prefer to view the sofa within a frame. However, might visual processing play a role in this phenomenon--that is, do visual features that are related to big and small objects look better at big and small visual sizes, respectively, even when observers do not have explicit access to semantic knowledge about the objects?

To test for visual size preferences, we used a two-interval forced choice task, in which each texform was presented at the preferred visual size of its corresponding original image, and a visual size slightly bigger or smaller. Observers consistently selected the texform presented at the canonical visual size as the more aesthetically pleasing one. These results suggest that the preferred visual size of an object depends not only on explicit knowledge of its real-world size, but also can be evoked by mid-level visual features that systematically covary with an object's real-world size.</p>",2021-08-13

These perturbations caused by the viscoelastic nature of cell rearrangement are involved in various biological processes, such as embryogenesis, wound healing and cancer invasion. The mechanical waves, as a product of the active turbulence occurred at low Reynolds number, represent an oscillatory change in cell velocity and the relevant rheological parameters. The velocity oscillations, in the form of forward and backward flows, are driven by: viscoelastic force, surface tension force, and traction force. The viscoelastic force represents a consequence of inhomogeneous distribution of cell residual stress accumulated during CCM. This cause-consequence relation is considered on a model system such as the cell monolayer free expansion. The collision of forward and backward flows causes an increase in cell packing density which has a feedback impact on the tissue viscoelasticity and on that base influences the tissue stiffness. The evidence of how the tissue stiffness is changed near the cell jamming is conflicting. To fill this gap, we discussed the density driven change in the tissue viscoelasticity by accounting for the cell pseudo-phase transition from active (contractile) to passive (non-contractile) state appeared near cell jamming in the rheological modeling consideration.</p>",2021-08-09

Here, we used single molecule spectroscopy to track the formation and purification of oligomers and fibrils at the single particle level and compare their respective seeding potential in an amplification assay. Single molecule detection validates that size-exclusion chromatography efficiently separates oligomers from fibrils.

To collect data, we employed the line transect method using three complementary field surveys techniques: sign survey, camera-trapping, and opportunistic sighting survey during wet and dry seasons in 2020 and 2021. We stratified the study landscape into five land-use types-forest, wetland, grassland, agricultural land, and settlement. The result proved the occurrence of 12 carnivore species belonging to six families, including vulnerable Felidae species - <italic>Panthera pardus</italic>. Family Felidae and Herpestidae were composed of a greater number of species, while Hyaenidae and Mustelidae were each represented by single species. Out of identified species, only two species (<italic>Panthera pardus</italic> and <italic>Crocuta crocuta</italic>) were large-sized, while the rest were medium and small-sized carnivores. Overall, the mean richness of the study area was 5.73±0.284(SE).

Background 
The COVID-19 pandemic still poses a considerable threat to global health, resulting in an unprecedented demand for regular research to continuously identify and update its risk profiles to ensure relevant interventions. 

Objectives 
This study aimed to examine the epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in Ghana and identify risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease.

Method 
This was a cross-sectional study involving the data of patients with COVID-19 clinically managed at the Ga-East Municipal Hospital, the main COVID-19 treatment centre in Ghana, from 21st March to 21st June 2020. The data were retrieved from the electronic medical records and folders of the patients. It included sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 disease severity, and treatment outcomes. Binomial logistic regression was used to identify risk factors of severe COVID-19 illness.

Result 
Among the 360 COVID-19 cases in this study, 55.3% were males, and 44.7% were females. Their mean age was 39.9 years. Most of them were Ghanaians (92.8%) and employed (72.5%). The majority (93%) presented with mild disease, and hypertension (19.2%) was the most common comorbidity. The average length of hospital admission was 10.6 days. Many of the cases recovered (98.6%), resulting in a case fatality of 1.4%. Finally, the logistic regression showed that increasing age (OR=1.12, p= 0.002) and diabetes mellitus (OR=19.85, p=0.007) are risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease.

Conclusion 
Findings from the study confirmed that increasing age and diabetes mellitus are risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. Thus, Ghana could prioritise these identified populations when implementing interventions to reduce the COVID-19 disease burden.</p>",2021-08-13

Importantly, ligating the B-cell integrin, LFA-1, with ICAM-1 promotes IS formation when antigen is limiting. Whether the actin cytoskeleton plays a specific role in integrin-dependent IS formation is unknown. Here we show using super-resolution imaging of primary B cells that LFA-1: ICAM-1 interactions promote the formation of an actomyosin network that dominates the B-cell IS. This network is created by the formin mDia1, organized into concentric, contractile arcs by myosin 2A, and flows inward at the same rate as B-cell receptor (BCR): antigen clusters. Consistently, individual BCR microclusters are swept inward by individual actomyosin arcs. Under conditions where integrin is required for synapse formation, inhibiting myosin impairs synapse formation, as evidenced by reduced antigen centralization, diminished BCR signaling, and defective signaling protein distribution at the synapse. Together, these results argue that a contractile actomyosin arc network plays a key role in the mechanism by which LFA-1 co-stimulation promotes B-cell activation and IS formation.</p>",2021-08-13

To address metformin’s potentially dual influences on dementia risk—that it might reduce the hazard of death and put more people at risk of developing dementia while reducing the hazard of dementia by slowing biological aging, we used a competing risks approach and carefully grounded that within a causal inference emulated trial framework. To identify candidate biomarkers of metformin’s actions in the brain that might mediate reduced dementia risk, we conducted an in-vitro systems pharmacology evaluation of metformin and glyburide on differentiated human neural cells through differential gene expression. We named our multi-dimensional approach DRIAD-EHR (Drug Repurposing in Alzheimer’s Disease-Electronic Health Records). In intention-to-treat analyses, metformin was associated with a lower hazard of all-cause mortality than sulfonylureas in both cohorts.

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) assays against  Streptococcus mutans  were done for all the proportions above with ciprofloxacin and 2.5 % Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the positive and negative controls respectively. Antimicrobial interactions between the two extracts were also evaluated using Fractional Inhibitory and Bacterial Concentration Indices (FICI/FBCI). Results showed that EJ and CC had percentage yields of 20.05 % and 15.45 % respectively. All the extracts showed similar phytochemical profiles. They also demonstrated an inhibitory effect on  Streptococcus mutans with  MIC and MBC values ranging from 521 to 3333 µg/ml and 1042 to 3667 µg/ml respectively.

This knowledge gap does not originate from a lack of DNAm-trait associations, but rather stems from study design issues that affect the interpretability of EWAS results.

Using a well-characterized collection of diverse strains (N=630; 100 unique ribotypes [RTs]), we aimed to investigate PCR ribotyping prediction from core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). Additionally, we compared the discriminatory power of cgMLST (SeqSphere &amp; EnteroBase) and whole genome MLST (wgMLST) (EnteroBase) with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis). A unique cgMLST profile (&gt;6 allele differences) was observed in 82/100 ribotypes, indicating sufficient backward compatibility. Intra-RT allele difference varied per ribotype and MLST clade. Application of cg/wgMLST and SNP analysis in two outbreak settings with ribotypes RT078 and RT181 (known with a low intra-ribotype allele difference) showed no distinction between outbreak- and non-outbreak strains, in contrast to wgMLST and SNP analysis. We conclude that cgMLST has the potential to be an alternative to CE-PCR ribotyping. The method is reproducible, easy to standardize and offers higher discrimination. However, in some ribotype complexes adjusted cut-off thresholds and epidemiological data are necessary to recognize outbreaks.

Many children, adolescents and adults have experienced adverse mental health effects related to the pandemic and its impact on daily life, although the long-term impact on individuals and health systems is not well understood.  

Methods: This cross-sectional study was based on data from 2018-2021 collected via medical records from our hospital. Admissions were transformed into time-series data, and models were generated to analyze changes in admission rates for mental health emergencies in 2020 and 2021 compared to previous years. 
Results: Of 1906 inpatient encounters among 1543 unique patients seen by the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Consultation-Liaison service, there was a decrease in overall admissions beginning in March 2020, coinciding with statewide lock down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, admissions were reduced 36% compared to average admissions from 2018-2019. By 2021, overall admissions were significantly higher than for the previous three years. Similarly, the count of suicide attempts was significantly higher in 2021 compared to previous years. The rate of patients admitted to inpatient facilities upon discharge was significantly higher during the COVID-19 pandemic period. 
Conclusion: Admissions for mental health emergencies fluctuated during the period associated with the COVID-19 pandemic across an array of diagnoses. Increases in admissions and severity of mental health emergencies during COVID-19 may reflect a detrimental impact of the pandemic on the mental health of children, as well as unmet needs during this time.</p>",2021-08-13

During the national lockdown of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain, we developed and launched a Web App (Gestioemocional.cat) to promote emotional self-care in the general population and facilitate contact with healthcare professionals. 
Methods: Gestioemocional.cat targeted all individuals aged 18 years or more and was designed by adapting the contents of a mobile App for adjuvant treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (i.e., the PTSD Coach App) to the general population and the pandemic/lockdown scenario. We retrospectively assessed the utilization pattern of the Web App using data systematically retrieved from Google Analytics. Data were grouped into three time periods, defined using a join point analysis of COVID-19 incidence in our area: first wave, between-wave period, and second wave.
Results: The resulting Web App, maintains the navigation structure of the PTSD Coach App, with three main modules: tools for emotional self-care, a self-assessment test, and professional resources for on-demand contact. The self-assessment test combines the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and offers professional contact in the advent of a high level of depression and anxiety; contact is prioritized according to a screening questionnaire administered at the time of obtaining individual consent to be contacted. The tools for emotional self-care can be accessed either on-demand or symptom-driven. The utilization analysis showed a high number of weekly accesses during the first wave. In this period, press releases regarding critical events of the pandemic progression and government decisions on containment measures were followed by a utilization peak, irrespective of the sense (i.e., positive or negative) of the information. Positive information pieces (e.g., relaxation of containment measures due to a reduction of COVID-19 cases) resulted in a sharp increase in utilization immediately after information release, followed by a successive decline in utilization. The second wave was characterized by a lower and less responsive utilization of the Web App. 
Conclusions: mHealth tools may help the general population coping with stressful conditions associated with the pandemic scenario. Future studies shall investigate the effectiveness of these tools among the general population―including individuals without diagnosed mental illnesses―and strategies to reach as many people as possible.</p>",2021-08-13

Taking this framework to its logical extreme, we tested the hypothesis that movements are not necessary for the generation of predictions, the computation of prediction errors, and implicit motor adaptation. Human participants were cued to move a computer mouse to a visually displayed target and were subsequently cued to withhold those movements on a subset of trials. Visual errors displayed on both trials with and without movements to the target induced single-trial learning. Furthermore, learning on trials without movements persisted when accompanying movement trials were never paired with errors and when movement and sensory feedback trajectories were decoupled.

Most PWS cases are caused by paternal interstitial deletions of 15q11.2-q13.1, while a smaller number of cases are caused by chromosome 15 maternal uniparental disomy (PW-UPD). Children with PW-UPD are at higher risk for developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than the neurotypical population. In this study, we used expression analysis of PW-UPD neurons to try to identify the molecular cause for increased autism risk. Methods: Dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) from neurotypical control and PWS subjects were differentiated to neurons for mRNA sequencing. Significantly differentially expressed transcripts among all groups were identified. Downstream protein analysis including immunocytochemistry and immunoblots were performed to confirm the transcript level data and pathway enrichment findings. Results: We identified 9 transcripts outside of the PWS critical region (15q11.2-q13.1) that may contribute to core PWS phenotypes. Moreover, we discovered a global reduction in mitochondrial transcripts in the PW-UPD +ASD group. We also found decreased mitochondrial abundance along with mitochondrial aggregates in the cell body and neural projections of +ASD neurons. Conclusions: The 9 transcripts we identified common to all PWS subtypes may reveal PWS specific defects during neurodevelopment. Importantly, we found a global reduction in mitochondrial transcripts in PW-UPD +ASD neurons versus control and other PWS subtypes. We then confirmed mitochondrial defects in neurons from individuals with PWS at the cellular level. Quantification of this phenotype supports our hypothesis that the increased incidence of ASD in PW-UPD subjects may arise from mitochondrial defects in developing neurons.</p>",2021-08-09

Gene-for-gene -type interactions can identify new sources of resistance but genetic resistance is often short lived. Ultimately an understanding of how pathogens rapidly adapt will allow us to both increase resistance gene durability and more effectively target chemical treatments. Until recently all agricultural pathogens were living on wild hosts. To understand crop pathogen evolution, we compared genetic diversity in agricultural and wild populations. Wild reservoirs may be the source of emergent pathogen lineages, but here we outline a strategy for comparison of wild and agricultural pathogen populations to highlight genes adapting to agriculture. To address this, we have selected and developed the beet rust system (Beta vulgaris, Uromyces beticola, respectively) as our wild-agricultural model. Our hypothesis is that pathogen adaptation to agricultural crops will be evident as divergence in comparisons of wild and agricultural plant pathogen populations. We sampled isolates in both the wild and agriculture, sequenced and assembled and annotated a large fungal genome and analysed genetic diversity in 42 re-sequenced rust isolates. We found population differentiation between isolates in the wild compared to a predominantly agricultural group. Fungal effector genes are co-evolving with host resistance and are important for successful colonisation. We predicted (and found) that these exhibit a greater signal of diversification and adaptation and more importantly displayed increased wild agricultural divergence. Finding a signal of adaptation in these genes highlights this as an important strategy to identify genes which are key to pathogen success, that analysis of agricultural isolates alone cannot.</p>",2021-08-13

Instead of this ‘USP7-Mdm2-p53’ axis USP7 also works through an alternative new pathway identified in this study. Here in this study, we observed that the magnitude of apoptosis induction in response to USP7 inhibition was remarkably similar between cancer cells showing p53<sup>Null</sup> or p53<sup>Mut</sup> and those with p53<sup>Wt</sup>. Through a proteomics-based approach, we were able to identify XIAP as a novel interacting partner for USP7. XIAP is a potent and well-characterized member of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), which function through caspase inhibition. We successfully identified USP7 as a positive regulator of XIAP at post-translational but not at its transcriptional level. Using molecular modelling coupled with domain deletion studies, we show that the first three Ubl domains in association with the catalytic domain of USP7 interact with the BIR2 and the linker region between BIR2 and BIR3 domains of XIAP. Modulation of expression and catalytic activity of USP7 in multiple type of cancer cell lines showed that USP7 stabilizes XIAP through its deubiquitinase activity.

Multi-setting population-based studies on healthcare service presentations with self-harm covering the first 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic are yet to be published.
Aims
Ascertain changes across settings in healthcare service presentations with self-harm during Waves 1 and 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Method
E-cohort study using individual-level linked routine healthcare data from Wales, UK, 2016-March 2021. We measured weekly proportion of self-harm contacts and people who self-harmed in contact with general practice (GP), emergency department (ED) and hospital admissions. We modelled weekly trends using linear regression and generalised estimated equations, quantifying time differences using difference-in-difference (DiD).
Results
We included 3,552,210 Welsh residents aged ≥10 years. Counts of self-harm presentations across settings was at a minimum at the start of stay-at-home restrictions during both waves and recovered compared to previous years in 3-5 months. Those who self-harmed in April 2020 were more likely to be seen in GP compared to other settings and previous years - mean rate of OR=1.2, although actual numbers fell. The proportion of self-harm ED contacts admitted to hospital dropped from June 2020 (1.9 [1.5-2.3] pp/month). Self-harm and COVID-19 infection had a bidirectional effect - self-harm history had OR=1.4 [1.2-1.6] and incidence had DiD=1.1 [0.8-1.4].
Conclusions
Those that self-harmed and sought help during the COVID-19 pandemic potentially encountered stringent criteria for hospitalisation, particularly in Wave 2, while in Wave 1 they preferentially presented to GP. Reductions in contacts likely resulted in unmet healthcare needs which may later emerge placing further burden on individuals and healthcare services.</p>",2021-08-13

Methods: A computational workflow was performed to find HLA restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes among conserved amino acid sequences across the proteome of 474727 SARS-CoV-2 strains.
Results: A batch of covserved regions in the amino acid sequences were found in the proteome of the SARS-COV-2 strains. 2852 and 847 peptides were predicted to have high binding affinity to distint HLA class I and class II molecules. Among them, 1456 and 484 peptides are antigenic. 392 and 111 of the antigenic peptides were found in the conseved amino acid sequences. Among the antigenic-conserved peptides, 6 CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes and 7 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes were identifed. The T cell epitopes could be presented to T cells by high-affinity HLA molecules which are encoded by the HLA alleles with high population coverage.

Antigen rapid diagnostic testing (Ag-RDT) is widely used for population screening, but its health and economic benefits as a reactive intervention in healthcare settings are unclear. 
 
Methods: We used stochastic, individual-based modelling to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a long-term care facility with varying COVID-19 containment measures in place (social distancing, face masks, vaccination). In contrast to routine symptomatic testing using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we evaluated the efficacy and health-economic efficiency of single or repeated population-wide Ag-RDT screening interventions implemented in response to surges in nosocomial outbreak risk. 
 
Results: Depending on the baseline containment measures in place, nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 incidence was reduced by up to 40-47% (range of means) with routine RT-PCR testing, 59-63% with the addition of a timely round of Ag-RDT screening, and 69-75% with well-timed two-round screening. For the latter, a delay of 4 to 5 days between the first and second rounds was optimal for transmission prevention. Efficacy varied depending on test sensitivity, subpopulations targeted, and SARS-CoV-2 incidence in the community. Efficiency, however, varied primarily depending on the other containment measures in place: surveillance costs for a combined strategy of routine RT-PCR testing and reactive Ag-RDT screening ranged from a mean €420-€10,260/infection averted across scenarios (default unit costs: €5/Ag-RDT test, €50/RT-PCR test).

Interpretation: Reactive Ag-RDT screening complements routine RT-PCR testing, and systematic two-round screening helps overcome limited, time-varying diagnostic sensitivity. Health-economic gains scale significantly with underlying nosocomial outbreak risk.</p>",2021-08-13

Methods: In September-October 2020 we interviewed adults with mental health conditions pre-dating the pandemic whom we had previously interviewed three months earlier. Participants had been recruited through online advertising and voluntary sector community organisations. Interviews were conducted by telephone or video-conference by researchers with lived experience of mental health difficulties and explored changes over time in experiences of participants of the pandemic. 
Results: We interviewed 44 people, achieving diversity of demographic characteristics and a range of mental health conditions and service use among our sample. Three overarching themes were derived from interviews. The first theme Spectrum of adaptation: to difficulties in access to, or the quality of, statutory mental health services, through developing new personal coping strategies or identifying alternative sources of support. The second theme is Accumulating pressures: from pandemic-related anxieties and sustained disruption to social contact and support, and to mental health treatment. The third theme Feeling overlooked: A sense of people with pre-existing mental health conditions being overlooked during the pandemic by policy-makers at all levels. The latter was compounded for people from ethnic minority communities or with physical health problems.

However, phylogenetic, ecological and intraindividual variability patterns in phytolith shape remain largely unexplored. The full range of intraindividual phytolith shape variation (3650 2D outlines) from 73 extant grass species, 48 genera, 18 tribes, and 8 subfamilies (with special attention paid to Pooideae) was analysed using the geometric morphometric analysis based on the semilandmarks spanning phytolith outlines.

Our results reveal that while heterochromatin regions undergo substantial compression, select transcription competent regions with active transcription signature are preferentially maintained to achieve a highly-compacted yet functional chromatin state in terminal erythropoiesis, which is about 20-30% of the nuclear volume compared to that of erythroid progenitors. While the partition of euchromatic and heterochromatic regions (compartment A and B) remain mostly unchanged, H3K9me3 marks relocalize to the nuclear periphery and a significant number of H3K9me3 long-range interactions are formed in the three-dimensional rewiring during terminal erythroid chromatin condensation. Moreover, ∼63% of the topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries are disrupted, while certain TADs with active chromatin modification are selectively maintained during terminal erythropoiesis.

Ecdysone also promotes the expression of Wingless during both regeneration and normal development through a distinct regulatory pathway. This dual role for ecdysone explains how regeneration can still be completed successfully in dilp8-mutant larvae: higher ecdysone levels increase the regenerative activity of tissues, allowing regeneration to reach completion in a shorter time.

Specifically, we clarify that these laws, similarly to many other relationships observed in nature, are characterized not just by the existence of scaling, but also by certain characteristic values of the scaling exponents. By performing proper statistical analysis, we demonstrate that the relationships sensitive to temporal bacterial dynamics are not reproduced in the shuffled data. We also discuss that there is no clear evidence in the data that macroecological relationships in microbiota are primarily driven by external or environmental factors. Proper statistical analyses of the data suggest that the dynamics of gut microbiota, even on a constant diet, contains rich temporal structure. Therefore, it is likely that complex and non-linear internal dynamics may be primarily responsible for the observed macroecological laws in microbiota and other ecological communities.</p>",2021-08-10

Full likelihood implementations of the MSci model take such fluctuations as a major source of information about the history of species divergence and gene flow, and provide a powerful tool for estimating the direction, timing and strength of cross-species introgression using multilocus sequence data.  However, introgression models, in particular those that accommodate bidirectional introgression (BDI), are known to cause unidentifiability issues of the label-switching type, whereby different models or parameters make the same predictions about the genomic data and thus cannot be distinguished by the data.  Nevertheless, there has been no systematic study of unidentifiability when full likelihood methods are applied.  Here we characterize the unidentifiability of arbitrary BDI models and derive simple rules for its identification.  In general, an MSci model with k BDI events has 2^k unidentifiable towers in the posterior, with each BDI event between sister species creating within-model unidentifiability and each BDI between non-sister species creating cross-model unidentifiability.  We develop novel algorithms for processing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples to remove label switching and implement them in the BPP  program.

Crystallisation typically involves a multi-stage exploration of the available chemical space, beginning with an initial sampling (screening) followed by iterative refinement (optimisation). Effective screening is important for reducing the number of optimisation rounds required, reducing the cost and time required to determine a structure. Here, we propose an initial screen (Shotgun II) derived from analysis of the up-to-date Protein Data Bank (PDB) and compare it with the previously derived (2014) Shotgun I screen. In an update to that analysis, we clarify that the Shotgun approach entails finding the crystallisation conditions which cover the most diverse space of proteins by sequence found in the PDB - which can be mapped to the well known Maximum Coverage problem in computer science. With this realisation we are able to apply a more effective algorithm for selecting conditions, such that the Shotgun II screen outperforms the Shotgun I screen both in protein coverage and quantity of data input. Our data demonstrates that the Shotgun I screen, compared with alternatives, has been remarkably successful over the seven years it has been in use, indicating that Shotgun II is likely to be a highly effective screen.</p>",2021-08-12

The kinesin-3 family member KIF1A is a key mediator of this process by facilitating long-distance cargo delivery in a spatiotemporally regulated manner. While misregulation of KIF1A cargo delivery is observed in many neurodegenerative diseases, the regulatory mechanisms responsible for KIF1A cargo transport are largely unexplored. Our lab has recently characterized a mechanism for a unique pausing behavior of KIF1A in between processive segments on the microtubule. This behavior, mediated through an interaction between the KIF1A K-loop and the polyglutamylated C-terminal tails of tubulin, helps us further understand how KIF1A conducts long-range cargo transport. However, how this pausing behavior is influenced by other regulatory factors on the microtubule is an unexplored concept. The microtubule associated protein Tau is one potential regulator, as altered Tau function is a pathological marker in many neurodegenerative diseases. However, while the effect of Tau on kinesin-1 and -2 has been extensively characterized, its role in regulating KIF1A transport is greatly unexplored at the behavioral level. Using single-molecule imaging, we have identified Tau-mediated regulation of KIF1A pausing behavior and motility. Specifically, our findings imply a competitive interaction between Tau and KIF1A for the C-terminal tails of tubulin. We introduce a new mechanism of Tau-mediated kinesin regulation by inhibiting the ability of KIF1A to use C-terminal tail reliant pauses to connect multiple processive segments into a longer run length. Moreover, we have correlated this regulatory mechanism to the behavioral dynamics of Tau, further elucidating the function of Tau diffusive and static behavioral state on the microtubule surface. In summary, we introduce a new mechanism of Tau-mediated motility regulation, providing insight on how disruptions in axonal transport can lead to disease state pathology.</p><sec><title>SIGNIFICANCE</title><p>KIF1A mediated cargo transport is essential in many cellular processes such as axonal transport and neuronal development.

In the production practice, we have identified some browning resistant varieties,and we selected a browning-resistant variety to compare with ordinary variety to reveal the resistance mechanism. Using transcriptomics and metabolomics, the differences in gene expression and metabolite levels were revealed, respectively. The results showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) like  AbPPO4  ,  AbPPO3   and  AbPPO2   were differently expressed and these DEGs involved in many pathways that related to browning. The expression of  AbPPO   expression play an important role in the browning of  A. bisporus   and multiple PPO family members are involved in the regulation of browning.

These organic acids had a higher level in anti-browning (BT) than easy-browning varieties (BS), although the profile was very heterogeneous. On the contrary, the content of trehalose in BS was significantly higher than that in BT. Higher organic acids decreased pH and further inhibited PPO activity. In addition, the BS had a higher content of trehalose, which might play roles in maintain the activity of PPO. The difference of browning resistance between BS and BT is mainly due to the differential regulation mechanism of PPO.</p>",2021-08-13

A key challenge in the evaluation of liver function with DLFTs is the large inter-individual variability. Indocyanine green (ICG) is a widely applied test compound used for the evaluation of liver function. After an intravenous administration, pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters are calculated from the plasma disappearance curve of ICG which provide an estimate of liver function. The hepatic elimination of ICG is affected by physiological factors such as hepatic blood flow or binding of ICG to plasma proteins, anthropometric factors such as body weight, age, and sex, or the protein amount of the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3) mediating the hepatic uptake of ICG.

In short, those all are diverse variability quantifiers. The higher variability subset has about 25 %, the lower one - 45%.</p>",2021-08-13

This study was undertaken to predict the distributions of the potential suitable habitats of <italic>Pouteria adolfi-friederici</italic> and <italic>Prunus africana</italic> tree species under the current and two future climate scenarios (i.e., RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 in 2050 and 2070) using MaxEnt software (version: 3.4.4.). Eleven less correlated environmental variables (r&lt;0.7) were identified and used to make the prediction models. Elevational shifts of the highly suitable habitats, effects of elevation, solar radiation and topographic position in relation to the current and future climatic scenarios on the habitats were statistically analyzed using independent t-test and linear model. Under all climate scenarios, we found a decrease in the proportion of areas of highly suitable habitats for both study species. High potentials of suitable habitats for <italic>Pouteria adolfi-friederici</italic> are predicted to be confined to southwest, west central and south parts of Ethiopia in fragmented moist afromontane forest patches, while it is in the southwest and west central parts of Ethiopia for <italic>Prunus africana</italic>. On basis of vegetation types of the country, potential suitable habitats for <italic>Pouteria adolfi-friederici</italic> are predicted to occur in moist evergreen forest, dry evergreen forest and grassland complex and <italic>Combretum-Terminalia</italic> woodland vegetation types. Whereas, moist evergreen forest, dry evergreen forest and grassland complex and riverine vegetation types are predicted to comprise potential suitable habitats for <italic>Prunus africana,</italic> showing considerable spatial dynamics. Overall, our results suggest that the strategies deem to design biodiversity conservation should take into account the dynamics of the suitable niches of different species under different future climate scenarios.</p>",2021-08-12

Aphids display XX/X0 sex chromosomes and combine unusual X chromosome inheritance with cyclical parthenogenesis. Theoretical and empirical works support the hypothesis that the large excess of male-biased genes observed on the aphid X chromosome compared to autosomes has evolved in response to sexual conflicts, by restricting the product of a sexually antagonistic allele to the sex it benefits. However, whether such masculinization of the X affects all tissues (as expected if it evolved in response to sexual conflicts) or reflects tissue specificities (which would contradict the sexual conflict hypothesis) remains an open question. To address it, we measured gene expression in different somatic and gonadic tissues of males, sexual females and parthenogenetic females of the pea aphid. We observed a masculinization of the X at the tissue-level, with male-biased genes being 2.5 to 3.5 more frequent on the X than expected. We also tested the hypothesis that gene duplication can facilitate the attenuation of conflicts by allowing gene copies to neo- or sub-functionalize and reach sex-specific optima. As predicted, X-linked copies of duplicated genes having their other copies on autosomes were more frequently male-biased (40.5% of the genes) than duplicated autosomal genes (6.6%) or X-linked single-copy genes (32.5%). These results highlight a peculiar pattern of expression of X-linked genes in aphids at the tissue level and provides further support for sex-biased expression as a mechanism to attenuate intra-locus sexual conflicts.</p>",2021-08-13

India is experiencing its second wave with a huge surge in the number of cases exponentially causing huge impact on health care infrastructure and the demand supply chain. As a result several new modalities have been used, one of which is the use of remdesivir and baricitinib. Hence this study is aimed at finding out the clinical and biochemical profile of the patients who have received the combination
Materials and Methods: All the patients who have received the combination meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria have been included in the study. A total of 31 participants were included and their records were retrospectively analyzed.
Results: There was a significant reduction in the oxygen requirement, CRP and IL-6 levels with p values&lt;0.05. However, in the non-survivors group, there was no statistically significant reduction. Serial monitoring of NLR ratio showed increase towards the fifth day, especially in the non-survivor group it was as high as 41.24. The mortality rate was found to be 10% and the cause being secondary sepsis in all of them.
Conclusion: The ACTT-2 trail has proved the efficacy of the use of the remdesivir and baricitinib combination with mortality benefit. In our study we found similar results which was well co-related with clinical and biochemical parameters like CRP and IL-6 especially in people with co-morbidites.</p>",2021-08-13

Papin'}]","<p>Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) are valuable tools for understanding microbial community metabolism. The process of automatically generating GENREs includes identifying metabolic reactions supported by sufficient genomic evidence to generate a draft metabolic network. The draft GENRE is then gapfilled with additional reactions in order to recapitulate specific growth phenotypes as indicated with associated experimental data. Previous methods have implemented absolute mapping thresholds for the reactions automatically included in draft GENREs; however, there is growing evidence that integrating annotation evidence in a continuous form can improve model accuracy. There is a need for flexibility in the structure of GENREs to better account for uncertainty in biological data, unknown regulatory mechanisms, and context specificity associated with data inputs. To address this issue, we present a novel method that provides a framework for quantifying combined genomic, biochemical, and phenotypic evidence for each biochemical reaction during automated GENRE construction. Our method, Constraint-based Analysis Yielding reaction Usage across metabolic Networks (CANYUNs), generates accurate GENREs with a quantitative metric for the cumulative evidence for each reaction included in the network. The structure of a CANYUN GENRE allows for the simultaneous integration of three data inputs while maintaining all supporting evidence for biochemical reactions that may be active in an organism. CANYUNs is designed to maximize the utility of experimental and annotation datasets and to ultimately assist in the curation of the reference datasets used for the automatic reconstruction of metabolic networks. We validated CANYUNs by generating an  E. coli  K-12 model and compared it to the manually curated reconstruction iML1515. Finally, we demonstrated the use of CANYUNs to build a model by generating an  E. coli  Nissle CANYUN GENRE using novel phenotypic data that we collected. This method may address key challenges for the procedural construction of metabolic networks by leveraging uncertainty and redundancy in biological data.</p>",2021-08-13

The MAPK Erk pathway, which is activated in a large proportion of human tumours, is a prototypic example of distinct cell fates being driven by signal intensity. We have used primary hepatocyte precursors transformed with different dosages of an oncogenic form of Ras to model subclonal variations in MAPK signalling. Orthotopic allografts of Ras-transformed cells in immunocompromised mice gave rise to fast-growing aggressive tumours, both at the primary location and in the peritoneal cavity. Fluorescent labelling of cells expressing different oncogene levels, and consequently varying levels of MAPK Erk activation, highlighted the selection processes operating at the two sites of tumour growth. Indeed, significantly higher Ras expression was observed in primary as compared to metastatic tumours, despite the evolutionary trade-off of increased apoptotic death in the liver that correlated with high Ras dosage. Analysis of the immune tumoral microenvironment at the two locations suggests that fast metastatic growth in the immunocompromised setting is abrogated in immunocompetent animals due to efficient antigen presentation by peritoneal dendritic cells. Furthermore, our data indicate that, in contrast to the metastatic outgrowth,  strong MAPK signalling is required in the primary liver tumours to resist elimination by NK cells. Overall, this study describes a quantitative aspect of tumour heterogeneity and highlights potential vulnerability of a subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma as a function of MAPK Erk signalling intensity.</p>",2021-08-13
