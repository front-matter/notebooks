Even though the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) emerged during India's second wave of infections, Delta variants have grown dominant internationally and are still evolving. On November 26, 2021, WHO identified the variant B.1.1.529 as a variant of concern, naming it Omicron, based on evidence that Omicron contains numerous mutations that may influence its behaviour. However, the mode of transmission and severity of the Omicron variant remains unknown. We used computational studies to examine the Delta and Omicron variants in this work and found that the Omicron variant had a higher affinity for human ACE2 than the Delta variant due to a significant number of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, indicating a higher potential for transmission. Based on docking studies, the Q493R, N501Y, S371L, S373P, S375F, Q498R, and T478K mutations contribute significantly to high binding affinity with human ACE2. In comparison to the Delta variant, both the entire spike protein and the RBD in Omicron include a high proportion of hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine and phenylalanine. These amino acids are located within the protein's core and are required for structural stability. Omicron has a higher percentage of alpha-helix structure than the Delta variant in both whole spike protein and RBD, indicating that it has a more stable structure. We observed a disorder-order transition in the Omicron variant between spike protein RBD regions 468-473, and it may be significant in the influence of disordered residues/regions on spike protein stability and binding to ACE2. A future study might investigate the epidemiological and biological consequences of the Omicron variant.</p>",2021-12-03

Despite this fundamental role in eukaryotic cell biology, we lack a phylogenetically-comprehensive understanding of chromatin evolution. Here, we combine comparative proteomics and genomics analysis of chromatin in eukaryotes and archaea. Proteomics uncovers the existence of histone post-translational modifications in Archaea. However, archaeal histone modifications are scarce, in contrast with the highly conserved and abundant marks we identify across eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that chromatin-associated catalytic functions (e.g., methyltransferases) have pre-eukaryotic origins, whereas histone mark readers and chaperones are eukaryotic innovations. We show that further chromatin evolution is characterized by expansion of readers, including capture by transposable elements and viruses. Overall, our study infers detailed evolutionary history of eukaryotic chromatin: from its archaeal roots, through the emergence of nucleosome-based regulation in the eukaryotic ancestor, to the diversification of chromatin regulators and their hijacking by genomic parasites.</p>",2021-12-01

Whilst antibody cross-reactivity with the Spike glycoproteins (S) of diverse coronaviruses has been documented, it remains unclear whether such antibody responses, typically targeting the conserved S2 subunit, contribute to or mediate protection, when induced naturally or through vaccination. Using a mouse model, we show that prior HCoV-OC43 S immunity primes neutralising antibody responses to otherwise subimmunogenic SARS-CoV-2 S exposure and promotes S2-targeting antibody responses. Moreover, mouse vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 S2 elicits antibodies that neutralise diverse animal and human alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses <italic>in vitro</italic>, and protects against SARS-CoV-2 challenge <italic>in vivo</italic>. Lastly, in mice with a history of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-based S vaccination, further S2 vaccination induces stronger and broader neutralising antibody response than booster Wuhan S vaccination, suggesting it may prevent repertoire focusing caused by repeated homologous vaccination. The data presented here establish the protective value of an S2-targeting vaccine and support the notion that S2 vaccination may better prepare the immune system to respond to the changing nature of the S1 subunit in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), as well as to unpredictable, yet inevitable future coronavirus zoonoses.</p>",2021-12-01

However, winter crops with a vernalisation requirement still require up to 6–10 weeks in low-temperature conditions before transition to reproductive development. Here, we tested a suite of environmental conditions and protocols to investigate if vernalisation can be satisfied more efficiently. We identified a vernalisation method consisting of exposing seeds at the soil surface to an extended photoperiod of 22 h day:2 h night at 10°C with transfer to speed breeding conditions that dramatically reduces generation time in both winter wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) and winter barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>).

In contrast, TOP-1 depletion did not affect long-range spreading but resulted in accumulation of condensin DC within expressed gene bodies. Both TOP-1 and TOP-2 depletions resulted in X chromosome transcriptional upregulation indicating that condensin DC translocation at both scales is required for its function in gene repression. Together the distinct effects of TOP-1 and TOP-2 on condensin DC distribution revealed two distinct modes of condensin DC association with chromatin: long-range translocation that requires decatenation/unknotting of DNA and short-range translocation across genes that requires resolution of transcription-induced supercoiling.</p>",2021-11-30

However, the optimal way to leverage STING activation in non-immunogenic tumors is still unclear. Here, we show that cGAMP delivery by intra-tumoral injection of virus-like particles (cGAMP-VLP) leads to differentiation of tumor-specific T cells, decrease in tumor regulatory T cells (Tregs) and anti-tumoral responses that synergize with PD1 blockade. By contrast, intra-tumoral injection of synthetic CDN leads to tumor necrosis and systemic T cell activation but no differentiation of tumor-specific T cells, and a demise of immune cells in injected tumors. Analyses of cytokine responses and genetic models revealed that cGAMP-VLP preferentially targets STING in dendritic cells at a 1000-fold less dose than synthetic CDN. Sub-cutaneous administration of cGAMP-VLP showed synergy when combined with a tumor Treg-depleting antibody to elicit systemic tumor-specific T cells, leading to complete and lasting tumor eradication.

However, lesion studies in preclinical models and in humans with refractory chronic pain suggest that VMPFC may play a more general role in representing the affective and motivational qualities of pain that contribute to its strong aversive drive.

In this study we show that Ikzf4, another Ikaros family protein, cooperates with Ikzf1 to control cone photoreceptor production during early stages of retinal development, whereas at late stages, when Ikzf1 is no longer expressed in progenitors, Ikzf4 is instead required for Müller glia production. Using CUT&amp;RUN sequencing, we find that both Ikzf1 and Ikzf4 generally bind to the same genes involved in cone development and other early-born fates, but at different cis-regulatory elements.

However, this hypothesis lacks experimental validation. We tested this model in the context of the recurrent evolution of resistance to cardiotonic steroids (CTS) across diverse groups of tetrapods, which occurs via specific amino acid substitutions to the α-subunit family of Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (ATP1A). After identifying a series of recurrent substitutions at two key sites of ATP1A1 predicted to confer CTS resistance, we performed protein engineering experiments to test the functional consequences of introducing these substitutions onto divergent species backgrounds. While we find that substitutions at these sites can have substantial background-dependent effects on CTS resistance, we also find no evidence for background-dependent effects on protein activity. We further show that the magnitude of a substitution’s effect on activity does not depend on the overall extent of ATP1A1 sequence divergence between species. More generally, a global analysis of substitution patterns across ATP1A orthologs and paralogs reveals that the probability of convergent substitution protein-wide is not predicted by sequence divergence.

Objective: To determine the causes of death, histological organ alteration, and viral spread in relation to demographic, clinical-pathological, viral variants, and vaccine types. 
Design: Comprehensive retrospective observational cohort study.
Setting: Consecutive cases from four German academic medical centers.
Patients: Deceased with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection after vaccination who died between January and November 2021. Collections of 29 vaccinees which were analyzed and compared to 141 nonvaccinated control cases.
Results: Autopsies were performed on 16 partially and 13 fully vaccinated individuals. Most patients were elderly and suffered from several relevant comorbidities. Real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) identified a significantly increased rate of generalized viral dissemination within the organism in vaccinated cases versus nonvaccinated cases (45% vs. 16%, respectively; P = 0.008). Vaccinated cases also showed high viral loads, reaching Ct values below 10, especially in the upper airways and lungs. This was accompanied by high rates of pulmonal bacterial or mycotic superinfections and the occurrence of immunocompromising factors such as malignancies, immunosuppressive drug intake, or decreased immunoglobulin levels. All these findings were particularly accentuated in partially vaccinated patients compared to fully vaccinated individuals. A fatal course after vaccination occurred in only 14% of all COVID-19 deceased in Augsburg.
Limitations: Restricted number of cases
Conclusions: Fatal cases of COVID-19 in vaccinees were rare and often associated with severe comorbidities or other immunosuppressive conditions. Interestingly, we observed striking virus dissemination in our case study, which may indicate a decreased ability to eliminate the virus in patients with an impaired immune system. However, the potential role of antibody-dependent enhancement must also be ruled out in future studies.</p>",2021-12-04

Remarkably, NF-κB dynamics in responding cells can simultaneously encode information about cytokine dose, duration, and distance to the cytokine source.

The rise of new variants of concern (VOCs) represents a difficult challenge due to the loss vaccine and natural immunity, and increased transmissibility. All circulating VOCs contain mutations in the spike glycoprotein, which mediates fusion between the viral and host cell membranes, via its receptor binding domain (RBD) that binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In an attempt to understand the effect of RBD mutations in circulating VOCs, a lot of attention has been given to the RBD-ACE2 interaction. However, this type of analysis is limited, since it ignores more indirect effects, such as the conformational dynamics of the RBD itself. Observing that some VOCs mutations occur in residues that are not in direct contact with ACE2, we hypothesized that they could affect RBD conformational dynamics. To test this, we performed long atomistic (AA) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the structural dynamics of <italic>wt</italic> RBD, and that of three circulating VOCs (alpha, beta, and delta). Our results show that in solution, wt RBD presents two distinct conformations: an “open” conformation where it is free to bind ACE2; and a “closed” conformation, where the RBM ridge blocks the binding surface. The alpha and beta variants significantly impact the open/closed equilibrium, shifting it towards the open conformation by roughly 20%. This shift likely increases ACE2 binding affinity. Simulations of the currently predominant delta variant RBD were extreme in this regard, in that a closed conformation was never observed. Instead, the system alternated between the before mentioned open conformation and an alternative “reversed” one, with a significantly changed orientation of the RBM ridge flanking the RBD. This alternate conformation could potentially provide a fitness advantage not only due to increased availability for ACE2 binding, but also by aiding antibody escape through epitope occlusion. These results support the hypothesis that VOCs, and particularly the delta variant, impact RBD conformational dynamics in a direction that simultaneously promotes efficient binding to ACE2 and antibody escape.</p>",2021-12-01

RCS on small circular RNAs - as indicated by molecular dynamics simulations - induces a progressive build-up of conformational strain with destabilisation of nascent strand 5’ and 3’ ends. At the same time, we observe sustained RCS by a triplet polymerase ribozyme on small circular RNAs over multiple orbits with strand displacement yielding concatemeric RNA products. Furthermore, we show RCS of a circular Hammerhead ribozyme capable of self-cleavage and re-circularisation. Thus, all steps of a viroid-like RNA replication pathway can be catalysed by RNA alone.

Recent evidence suggests that the brain relies on a chain of hierarchically organized areas with increasing temporal receptive windows to process naturalistic narratives. In this study, we use inter-subject functional connectivity to reveal a stimulus-driven information flow along the cortical hierarchy. Using cross-correlation analysis to estimate the time lags between six functional networks, we found a fixed temporal sequence of information flow, starting in early auditory areas, followed language areas, the attention network, and lastly the default mode network. This gradient is consistent across eight distinct stories but absent in resting-state and scrambled story data, indicating that the lag gradient reflects the construction of narrative features. Finally, we simulate a variety of narrative integration models and demonstrate that nested narrative structure along with the gradual accumulation of information within the boundaries of linguistic events at each level of the processing hierarchy is sufficient to reproduce the lag gradient. Taken together, this study provides a computational framework for how information flows along the cortical hierarchy during narrative comprehension.</p>",2021-12-03

Given the large number of mutations in Omicron's spike protein compared to the original Wuhan strain, its binding efficacy to the ACE2 receptor and its potential to escape antibodies are in the spotlight. Recently, we presented an ab initio quantum mechanical model to characterize the interactions of spike protein's Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) with select antibodies and ACE2 variants. The model identified weak links among the residues constituting interactions with the human ACE2 receptor (hACE2), and also enabled us to characterize in silico mutated RBDs to identify potential Variants of Concern (VOC). In particular, we focused on the role of RBD residue 484 in the interaction of the Delta variant with ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). In this report, we apply our model to the Omicron VOC, and characterize its interaction pattern with hACE2. Our results show that (i) binding affinity with hACE2, compared to Delta, is considerably increased, possibly contributing to increased infectivity. (ii) The interaction pattern between B1.1.529 and hACE2 differs from previous variants by shifting the hot-spot interaction residues on hACE2, and potentially affecting nAbs efficacy. (iii) A K mutation in the RBD residue 484 can further improve Omicron's binding of hACE2 and evasion of nAbs. Finally, we argue that a library of hot-spots for point-mutations can predict binding interaction energies of complex variants.</p>",2021-12-03

Here, we show that in budding yeast, mitochondrial DNA copy number increases with cell volume, both in asynchronously cycling populations and during G1 arrest. Our findings suggest that cell-volume-dependent mitochondrial DNA maintenance is achieved through nuclear encoded limiting factors, including the mitochondrial DNA polymerase Mip1 and the packaging factor Abf2, whose amount increases in proportion to cell volume.

How this diversity contributes to memory function is not completely known. Previous formal studies indicate inhibition differentiated by local and global connectivity in associative memory networks functions to rescale the level of retrieval of excitatory assemblies. However, such studies lack biological details such as a distinction between types of neurons (excitatory and inhibitory), unrealistic connection schemas, and non-sparse assemblies. In this study, we present a rate-based cortical model where neurons are distinguished (as excitatory, local inhibitory, or global inhibitory), connected more realistically, and where memory items correspond to sparse excitatory assemblies. We use this model to study how local-global inhibition balance can alter memory retrieval in associative memory structures, including naturalistic and artificial structures. Experimental studies have reported inhibitory neurons and their sub-types uniquely respond to specific stimuli and can form sophisticated, joint excitatory-inhibitory assemblies. Our model suggests such joint assemblies, as well as a distribution and rebalancing of overall inhibition between two inhibitory sub-populations – one connected to excitatory assemblies locally and the other connected globally – can quadruple the range of retrieval across related memories. We identify a possible functional role for local-global inhibitory balance to, in the context of choice or preference of relationships, permit and maintain a broader range of memory items when local inhibition is dominant and conversely consolidate and strengthen a smaller range of memory items when global inhibition is dominant. This model therefore highlights a biologically-plausible and behaviourally-useful function of inhibitory diversity in memory.</p>",2021-12-01

SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus where the basis of VLP formation has been shown to be the co-expression of the spike, membrane and envelope structural proteins. Here we describe the generation of SARS-CoV-2 VLPs by the co-expression of the salient structural proteins in insect cells using the established baculovirus expression system.

However, anatomical locations of functional connectome hubs are largely inconsistent and less reproducible among extant reports, partly due to inadequate sample size and differences in image processing and network analysis. Moreover, the genetic signatures underlying the robust connectome hubs remain unknown. Here, we conduct the first worldwide voxelwise meta-connectomic analysis by pooling resting-state functional MRI data of 5,212 healthy young adults across 61 independent international cohorts with harmonized image processing and network analysis protocols.

We experimentally manipulated allocation to male function in Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed) in a field experiment and measured mating success using genetic assays.

Theory on hyperparasitism has mostly focused on their impact on the evolution of virulence of their parasite host and relatively little is known about evolutionary trajectories of hyperparasites themselves. Our general modeling framework highlights the central role the that ability of a hyperparasite to be transmitted with its parasite plays in their evolution. Hyperparasites which transmit with their parasite hosts (hitchhike) will be selected for lower virulence, trending towards hypermutualism or hypercommensalism and select against causing a reduction in parasite virulence (hypovirulence). We examine the impact on the evolution of hyperparasite systems a of a wide range of host and parasite traits showing, for example, that high parasite virulence selects for higher hyperparasite virulence feeding back into selection for hypovirulence in the parasite.

Monosynaptic tracing, or the gated replication and spread of a deletion-mutant rabies virus to label neurons directly connected to a targeted population of starting neurons1, is the most widely-used technique for mapping neural circuitry, but the rapid cytotoxicity of first-generation rabies viral vectors has restricted its use almost entirely to anatomical applications. We recently introduced double-deletion-mutant second-generation rabies viral vectors, showing that they have little or no detectable toxicity and are efficient means of retrogradely targeting neurons projecting to an injection site2, but they have not previously been shown to be capable of gated replication in vivo, the basis of monosynaptic tracing. Here we present a complete second-generation system for labeling direct inputs to genetically-targeted neuronal populations with minimal toxicity, using double-deletion-mutant rabies viruses. Spread of the viruses requires complementation of both of the deleted viral genes in trans in the starting postsynaptic cells; suppressing the expression of these viral genes following an initial period of viral replication, using the Tet-Off system, reduces toxicity to the starting cells without decreasing the efficiency of viral spread. Using longitudinal two-photon imaging of live monosynaptic tracing in visual cortex, we found that 94.4% of all labeled cells, and an estimated 92.3% of starting cells, survived for the full twelve-week course of imaging. Two-photon imaging of calcium responses in labeled networks of neurons in vivo over ten weeks showed that labeled neurons' visual response properties remained stable for as long as we followed them.

Plasmodium, a divergent unicellular eukaryote and causative agent of malaria, displays an atypical closed mitosis with an MTOC, reminiscent of the acentriolar MTOC, embedded in the nuclear membrane at most proliferative stages. Mitosis during male gamete formation is accompanied by flagellum formation: within 15 minutes, genome replication (from 1N to 8N) and three successive rounds of mitosis without nuclear division occur, with coordinated axoneme biogenesis in the cytoplasm resulting in eight flagellated gametes. There are two MTOCs in male gametocytes. An acentriolar MTOC located with the nuclear envelope and a centriolar MTOC (basal body) located within the cytoplasm that are required for flagellum assembly. To study the location and function of SAS4 during this rapid process, we examined the spatial profile of SAS4 in real time by live cell imaging and its function by gene deletion. We show its absence during asexual proliferation but its presence and coordinated association and assembly of SAS4 with another basal body component, kinesin8B, which is involved in axoneme biogenesis. In contrast, its separation from the nuclear kinetochore marker NDC80 suggests that SAS4 is part of the basal body and outer centriolar MTOC residing in the cytoplasm.

Here, we report that the poplar genome contains two paralogues encoding NRAMP3 metal transporters localized in tandem. All Populus species analyzed had two copies of NRAMP3, whereas only one could be identified in Salix species indicating that duplication occurred when the two genera separated. Both copies are under purifying selection and encode functional transporters, as shown by expression in the yeast heterologous expression system. However, genetic complementation revealed that only one of the paralogues has retained the original function in release of metals stored in the vacuole previously characterized in A. thaliana. Confocal imaging showed that the other copy has acquired a distinct localization to the Trans Golgi Network (TGN). Expression in poplar indicated that the copy of NRAMP3 localized on the TGN has a novel function in the control of cell-to-cell transport of manganese.

It is unknown, however, how repeated exposure to an acute painful unconditioned stimulus in a distinct context modifies pain sensitivity or the expectation of pain in that environment. To answer this question, we conditioned mice to associate distinct contexts with either repeated administration of a mild visceral pain stimulus (intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid) or vehicle injection over the course of three days. On the final day of experiments animals received either an acid injection or vehicle injection prior to being placed into both contexts. In this way, contextual control of pain sensitivity and pain expectation could be tested respectively. Both male and female mice developed context-dependent conditional pain tolerance, a phenomenon mediated by endogenous opioid signaling.

This work suggests that there are two, interrelated mechanisms of apical polarity localisation: cell adhesion and cell division. Alignment of these mechanisms allows for redundancy in the system and ensures the localisation of a coherent epithelial structure within a growing organ.</p>",2021-12-01

According to one prominent account of intrinsic motivation, the Learning Progress Motivation theory, the preference for difficult tasks reflects the dynamic range that these tasks yield for minimization of performance accuracy prediction errors (Oudeyer, Kaplan &amp; Hafner, 2007). Here we test this hypothesis, by asking whether greater engagement with intermediately difficult tasks, indexed by subjective ratings and objective pupil measurements, is a function of trial-wise changes in performance prediction error. In a novel paradigm, we determined each individuals capacity for task performance and used difficulty levels that are too low, intermediately challenging or high for that individual. We demonstrated that intermediately challenging tasks resulted in greater liking and engagement scores compared with easy tasks. Task-evoked and baseline pupil size tracked objective task difficulty, where challenging tasks were associated with smaller baseline and greater phasic pupil responses than easy tasks. Most importantly, pupil responses were predicted by trial-to-trial changes in expected accuracy, performance prediction error magnitude and changes in prediction errors (learning progress), whereas smaller baseline pupil responses also predicted greater subjective engagement scores. Together, these results suggest that what is underlying the link between task engagement and intermediate tasks might be the dynamic range that these tasks yield for minimization of performance accuracy prediction errors.</p>",2021-12-03

We here tested whether experimental exposure to chronic traffic noise affected parental behaviour and reproductive success in offspring number and growth in an important model of avian development, the zebra finch (<italic>Taeniopygia guttata</italic>). In a counterbalanced repeated-measures design, breeding pairs experienced continuous playbacks of one of two types of highway noise that previous spatial choice tests had shown to be neutral (control) or aversive. We monitored offspring development and parental feeding rates and nest attendance. Parental nest attendance was positively correlated with feeding effort and was higher in the aversive than in the control sound treatment and this effect was more pronounced for parents attending larger broods. However, neither noise condition affected offspring number, growth or body mass. There was also an absence of an effect of noisy conditions on these reproductive parameters when we combined our data with two other comparable studies in the same species in a meta-analysis. We discuss whether the increased parental engagement is a potential compensatory strategy that alleviated direct noise effects on the chicks. However, impaired parent-offspring or within-pair communication could also have increased parents’ nest attendance time. Future work is required to test these possible explanations and investigate potential long-term costs of increased parental engagement.</p>",2021-12-01

Rising rates of antibiotic resistance among uropathogens have spurred consideration of alternative strategies such as bacteriophage (phage) therapy; however, phage-bacterial interactions within the urinary environment are poorly defined. Here, we assess the activity of two phages, HP3 and ES17, against clinical UPEC isolates using in vitro and in vivo models of UTI. In both bacteriologic medium and pooled human urine, we identified phage resistance arising within the first 6-8 hours of coincubation. Whole genome sequencing revealed that UPEC resistant to HP3 and ES17 harbored mutations in genes involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis. These mutations coincided with several in vitro phenotypes, including alterations to adherence to and invasion of human bladder epithelial HTB-9 cells, and increased biofilm formation. Interestingly, these phage-resistant UPEC demonstrated reduced growth in pooled human urine, which could be partially rescued by nutrient supplementation, and were more sensitive to several outer membrane targeting antibiotics than parental strains. Additionally, these phage-resistant UPEC were attenuated in a murine UTI model. In total, our findings suggest that while resistance to phages, such as LPS-targeted HP3 and ES17, may readily arise in the urinary environment, phage resistance is accompanied by fitness costs rendering UPEC more susceptible to host immunity or antibiotics.</p>",2021-12-03

These symptoms include sleep disturbances that often drive relapse, and emotional behaviors, e.g., irritability and anhedonia. We examined THC withdrawal-induced changes in striatal DA release and the extent to which sleep disruption and behavioral maladaptation manifest during withdrawal in a mouse chronic cannabis exposure model. Using a THC treatment regimen known to produce tolerance we measured electrically elicited DA release in acute brain slices from different striatal subregions during early and late THC abstinence. Long-term polysomnographic recordings from mice were used to assess vigilance state and sleep architecture before, during, and after THC treatment. We additionally assessed how behaviors that model human withdrawal symptoms are altered by chronic THC treatment in early and late abstinence. We detected altered striatal DA release, sleep disturbances that mimic clinical observations, and behavioral maladaptation in mice following tolerance inducing THC treatment. Sex differences were observed in nearly all metrics. Altered striatal DA release, sleep and affect-related behaviors associated with spontaneous THC abstinence were more consistently observed in male mice.

These modulations preceded changes in force features by ∼40 ms and possessed behavioral relevance, as less salient or absent modulation predicted a more stable force output.

We observe that FoSir5 decrotonylates a subunit of the fungal pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (FoDLAT) at K148, resulting in inhibition of the activity of the complex in mitochondria. Moreover, FoSir5 decrotonylates histone H3K18, leading to a downregulation of transcripts encoding enzymes of aerobic respiration pathways. Thus, the activity of FoSir5 coordinates regulation in different organelles to steer metabolic flux through respiration. As ATP content is positively related to fungal germination, we propose that FoSir5 negatively modulates conidial germination in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> through its metabolic impact. These findings provide insights into the multifaceted roles of decrotonylation, catalysed by FoSir5, that support conidial germination in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>.</p>",2021-11-30

Many studies focus on the breeding season, but surviving winter is equally important. Living in groups during winter can play a vital role as social connections within groups can provide many benefits such as protection from predators and increased access to resources. However, it is often unknown how social connections change across seasons in migratory animals. We focus on social connections in a migratory bird and ask whether social connections in winter continue during breeding. Golden-crowned sparrows have distinct, stable winter communities which include both site and group fidelity across years: birds almost always rejoin the same social community each year. If these birds have social connectivity across migration, we would expect individuals that associate in winter would also associate together on their breeding grounds. Our small-scale GPS tagging study combined with intensive social behavior data revealed that sparrows in the same tightly-knit winter community migrated to highly disparate locations during summer, showing that social connections in winter do not continue in summer. This suggests that golden-crowned sparrows have entirely separate social structures across seasons and that long-term social memories allow them to reform stable groups each winter.</p>",2021-12-03

During domestication, wild rice (O. rufipogon Griff.) was transformed by acquiring non-seed-shattering behaviour, an important genetic change that allowed humans to increase grain yield. However, we show previously identified loci, sh4 and qSH3, are individually insufficient to explain loss of seed shattering nor increases in harvest yield in wild rice. We identify the complementary interaction of key mutations for abscission layer interruption and panicle architecture that were causal in the early domestication of Asian rice. An interruption of abscission layer formation requires both sh4 and qSH3, which presents an apparent barrier to selection of shattering loss. We identified the causal single nucleotide polymorphism at qSH3 within a seed-shattering gene OsSh1 conserved in indica and japonica subspecies, but absent in the circum-aus group of rice. We demonstrate through harvest experiments that seed-shattering alone does not significantly impact yield. Instead, we observed yield increases under a SPR3-controlled closed panicle formation, which is augmented by the integration of sh4 and qSH3 alleles causing a slight inhibition of abscission layer. Complementary manipulation of seed shattering and panicle shape result in a panicle structure that is mechanically stable. We propose a stepwise route in the earliest phase of rice domestication in which selection for visible SPR3-controlled closed panicle morphology was instrumental in the sequential recruitment of sh4 and qSH3 and leading to loss of shattering.</p>",2021-12-03

These gene products are able to cut the opposing wildtype allele, and lead to its replacement with a copy of the gene drive through the homology-directed DNA repair pathway. When this allelic conversion occurs in the germline it leads to the preferential inheritance of the engineered allele — a property that has been proposed to disseminate engineered traits for managing disease-transmitting mosquito populations. Here, we report a novel gene-drive strategy relying on Cas9 nickases which operates by generating staggered paired-nicks in the DNA to promote propagation of the gene drive allele. We show that only when 5’ overhangs are generated, the system efficiently leads to allelic conversion. Further, the nickase gene-drive arrangement produces large stereotyped deletions, providing potential advantages for targeting essential genes.

The model shows how the titration effect aids self-sustained oscillations in a minimal genetic feedback loop: a gene that produces its own repressor directly — without cooperative transcription factor binding.

Detailed analysis of the co-crystal structures revealed that PIs with fluorinated P4 caps can sample alternate binding conformations that enable adapting to structural changes induced by the D168A substitution. Our results elucidate molecular mechanisms of fluorine-specific inhibitor interactions that can be leveraged in avoiding drug resistance.</p>",2021-11-30

Electrical nerve stimulation evokes high-frequency oscillations (HFO) at around 650 Hz in the contralateral S1. Likewise, paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation of M1 produces short interval intracortical facilitation (SICF) of motor evoked potentials in contralateral hand muscles. SICF features several peaks of facilitation which are separated by inter-peak intervals resembling HFO rhythmicity.
Hypothesis: In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the individual expressions of HFO and SICF are tightly related to each other and to the regional myelin content in the sensorimotor cortex.
Methods: In 24 healthy volunteers, we recorded HFO and SICF, and, in a subgroup of 20 participants, we mapped the cortical myelin content using the ratio between the T1- and T2-weighted MRI signal as read-out.
Results: The individual frequencies and magnitudes of HFO and SICF were tightly correlated: the intervals between the first and second peak of cortical HFO and SICF showed a positive linear relationship (r= 0.703, p&lt; 0.001), while their amplitudes were inversely related (r= -0.613, p= 0.001). The rhythmicity, but not the magnitude of the high-frequency responses, was related to the cortical myelin content: the higher the cortical myelin content, the shorter the inter-peak intervals of HFO and SICF.
Conclusion: The results confirm a tight functional relationship between high-frequency responses in S1 (i.e., HFO) and M1 (i.e., SICF). They also establish a link between the degree of regional cortical myelination and the expression of high-frequency responses in the human cortex, giving further the opportunity to infer their possible generators.</p>",2021-12-03

Due to the low abundance of ubiquitylated species in biological samples, considerable effort has been spent on developing methods to purify and detect ubiquitylated proteins. We have developed and characterized a novel tool for ubiquitin detection and purification based on OtUBD, a high-affinity ubiquitin-binding domain derived from an <italic>Orientia tsutsugamushi</italic> deubiquitylase. We demonstrate that OtUBD can be used to purify both monoubiquitylated and polyubiquitylated substrates from yeast and human tissue culture samples and compare their performance with existing methods. Importantly, we found conditions for either selective purification of covalently ubiquitylated proteins or co-isolation of both ubiquitylated proteins and their interacting proteins. As a proof-of-principle for these newly developed methods, we profiled the ubiquitylome and ubiquitin-associated proteome of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Combining OtUBD affinity purification with quantitative proteomics, we identified potential substrates for E3 ligases Bre1 and Pib1. OtUBD provides a versatile, efficient, and economical tool for ubiquitin researchers with specific advantages over other methods, such as in detecting monoubiquitylation or ubiquitin linkages to noncanonical sites.</p>",2021-12-02

Many computational methods have been developed to predict proteome-wide interaction networks, but few leverage both the sensitivity of structural information and the wide availability of sequence data. We present PEPPI, a pipeline which integrates structural similarity, sequence similarity, functional association data, and machine learning-based classification through a naive Bayesian classifier model to accurately predict protein-protein interactions at a proteomic scale. Through benchmarking against a set of 798 ground truth interactions and an equal number of non-interactions, we have found that PEPPI attains 4.5% higher AUROC than the best of other state-of-the-art methods. As a proteomic-scale application, PEPPI was applied to model the interactions which occur between SARS-CoV-2 and human host cells during coronavirus infection, where 403 high-confidence interactions were identified with predictions covering 73% of a gold standard dataset from PSICQUIC and demonstrating significant complementarity with the most recent high-throughput experiments. PEPPI is available both as a webserver and in a standalone version and should be a powerful and generally applicable tool for computational screening of protein-protein interactions.</p>",2021-12-03

Pathogenic mutations in P5CS gene (ALDH18A1) lead to neurocutaneous syndrome and skin relaxation connective tissue disease in humans, and P5CS deficiency seriously damages the ability to resist adversity in plants, which has an essential role in agriculture and human health. Recently, P5CS has been demonstrated forming the cytoophidium in vivo and filaments in vitro.

Point mutations that deplete such interactions disturb P5CS filamentation and greatly reduce the activity. Our findings reveal a previously undescribed mechanism that filamentation is crucial for the coordination between GK and GPR domains, and provide insights into structural basis for catalysis function of P5CS filament.</p>",2021-12-02

Deshpande'}, {'name': 'Emanuel A. Fronhofer'}]","<p>Contemporary evolution has the potential to significantly alter biotic responses to global change, including range expansion dynamics and biological invasions. However, predictive models often make highly simplifying assumptions about the genetic architecture underlying relevant traits. This can be problematic since genetic architecture defines evolvability, that is, evolutionary rates, and higher order evolutionary processes, which determine whether evolution will be able to keep up with environmental change or not. Therefore, we here study the impact of the genetic architecture of dispersal and local adaptation, two central traits of high relevance for range expansion dynamics, on the speed and variability of range expansions into an environmental gradient, such as temperature. In our theoretical model we assume that dispersal and local adaptation traits result from the products of two non-interacting gene-regulatory networks (GRNs). We compare our model to simpler quantitative genetics models and show that in the GRN model, range expansions are accelerated, faster and more variable. Increased variability implies that these evolutionary changes reduce predictability. We further find that acceleration in the GRN model is primarily driven by an increase in the rate of local adaptation to novel habitats which results from greater sensitivity to mutation (decreased robustness) and increased gene expression. Our results highlight how processes at microscopic scales, here, within genomes, can impact the predictions of large scale, macroscopic phenomena, such as range expansions, by modulating the rate of evolution.</p>",2021-12-02
