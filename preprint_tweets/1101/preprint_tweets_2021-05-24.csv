Here, we report an axis-defining event in meiotic oocytes of the sea star <italic>Patiria miniata</italic>. Dishevelled is a cytoplasmic Wnt pathway effector required for axis development in diverse species [2-4], but the mechanisms governing its function and distribution remain poorly defined. Using time-lapse imaging, we find that Dishevelled localizes uniformly to puncta throughout the cell cortex in Prophase I-arrested oocytes, but becomes enriched at the vegetal pole following meiotic resumption through a dissolution-condensation mechanism. This process is driven by an initial disassembly phase of Dvl puncta, followed by selective reformation of Dvl assemblies at the vegetal pole. Rather than being driven by Wnt signaling, this localization behavior is coupled to meiotic cell cycle progression and influenced by Lamp1+ endosome association and Frizzled receptors pre-localized within the oocyte cortex. Our results reveal a cell cycle-linked mechanism by which maternal cellular polarity is transduced to the embryo through spatially-regulated Dishevelled dynamics.</p>",2021-05-18

Increasing anthropogenic threads also require regular monitoring of invertebrate communities. The main obstacle is specimen- and species-rich samples consisting of thousands of small specimens. Traditional sorting techniques require manual handling based on morphology and are too slow and labor-intensive. Molecular techniques based on metabarcoding struggle with obtaining reliable abundance information. We here present a fully automated sorting robot for small specimens that are detected in the mixed sample using a convolutional neural network. Each specimen is then moved from the mixed sample to a well of a 96-well microplate in preparation for DNA barcoding. Prior to movement, the specimen is being photographed and assigned to 14 particularly common “classes” of insects in Malaise trap samples. The average assignment precision for the classes is 91.4 % (75-100 %) based on a preliminary neural network that is expected to improve further as more images are used for training. In order to obtain biomass information, the specimen images are also used to measure the specimen length and estimate the body volume. We outline how the “DiversityScanner” robot can be a key component for tackling and monitoring invertebrate diversity by generating large numbers of images that become training sets for species-, genus-, or family-level convolutional neural networks, once the imaged specimens are classified with DNA barcodes. The robot also allows for taxon-specific subsampling of large invertebrate samples. We conclude that the combination of automation, machine learning, and DNA barcoding has the potential to tackle invertebrate diversity at an unprecedented scale.</p>",2021-05-18

In this study we profiled changes in the nasal microbial communities as well as in host transcriptional profile during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using 16S amplicon sequencing and RNA sequencing. These analyses were coupled to viral genome sequencing. Our microbiome analysis revealed that the nasal microbiome of COVID patients was unique and was marked by an expansion of bacterial pathogens. Some of these microbes (i.e. <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>) were shared with COVID negative health care providers from the same medical center but absent in COVID negative outpatients seeking care at the same institutions suggesting acquisition of nosocomial respiratory pathogens. Specifically, we report a distinct increase in the prevalence and abundance of the pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> in COVID patients that correlated with viral RNA load. These data suggest that the inflammatory environment caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially exposure to the hospital environment leads to an expansion of bacterial pathogens in the nasal cavity that could contribute to increased incidence of secondary bacterial infections.

Following emergency use authorisation, scale up in vaccine administration has inevitably revealed vaccine related adverse effects; too rare to observe even in large Phase-III clinical trials.

We measured intrinsic timescales of local spiking activity within columns of area V4 while monkeys performed spatial attention tasks. The ongoing spiking activity unfolded across at least two distinct timescales—fast and slow—and the slow timescale increased when monkeys attended to the receptive fields location. A recurrent network model shows that multiple timescales in local dynamics arise from spatial connectivity mimicking vertical and horizontal interactions in visual cortex and that slow timescales increase with the efficacy of recurrent interactions.

Additionally, such screens have yet to identify the protease TMPRSS2, known to be important for viral entry at the plasma membrane. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of these screens and showed a high level of cell-type specificity of the identified hits, arguing for the necessity of additional models to uncover the full landscape of SARS-CoV-2 host factors. We performed genome-wide knockout and activation CRISPR screens in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, as well as knockout screens in Caco-2 intestinal cells. In addition to identifying ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as top hits, our study reveals a series of so far unidentified and critical host-dependency factors, including the Adaptins AP1G1 and AP1B1 and the flippase ATP8B1. Moreover, new anti-SARS-CoV-2 proteins with potent activity, including several membrane-associated Mucins, IL6R, and CD44 were identified. We further observed that these genes mostly acted at the critical step of viral entry, with the notable exception of ATP8B1, the knockout of which prevented late stages of viral replication. Exploring the pro- and anti-viral breadth of these genes using highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, seasonal HCoV-NL63 and -229E and influenza A orthomyxovirus, we reveal that some genes such as AP1G1 and ATP8B1 are general coronavirus cofactors. In contrast, Mucins recapitulated their known role as a general antiviral defense mechanism. These results demonstrate the value of considering multiple cell models and perturbational modalities for understanding SARS-CoV-2 replication and provide a list of potential new targets for therapeutic interventions.</p>",2021-05-19

Such variations, often unaccounted for and of unknown source, may interfere with true biological signals, resulting in misleading biological conclusions. In this work, we aim to characterize the major sources of technical variations in microbiome data and demonstrate how a state-of-the art approach can minimize their impact on downstream analyses. We analyzed 184 pig faecal metagenomes encompassing 21 specific combinations of deliberately introduced factors of technical and biological variations. We identify several known experimental factors, specifically storage conditions and freeze-thaw cycles, as a likely major source of unwanted variation in metagenomes. We also observed that these unwanted technical variations do not affect taxa uniformly, with freezing samples affecting taxa of class Bacteroidia the most, for example. Additionally, we benchmarked the performance of a novel batch correcting tool used in this study, RUV-III-NB (https://github.com/limfuxing/ruvIIInb/), to other popular batch correction methods, including ComBat, ComBat-seq, RUVg, and RUVs. While RUV-III-NB performed consistently robustly across our sensitivity and specificity metrics, most other methods did not remove unwanted variations optimally, with RUVg even overcorrecting and removing some of the true biological signals from the samples. Our analyses suggests that a careful consideration of possible technical confounders is critical in the experimental design of microbiome studies to ensure accurate biological reading of microbial taxa of interest, and that the inclusion of technical replicates is necessary to efficiently remove unwanted variations computationally.</p>",2021-05-22

We demonstrate Cas13-independent guide-induced gene silencing (GIGS) in three plant species, including stable transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. We determined that GIGS utilizes endogenous RNAi machinery despite the fact that crRNA are unlike canonical triggers of RNAi such as miRNA, hairpins or long double-stranded RNA. These results suggest that GIGS offers a novel and flexible approach to RNA reduction with potential benefits over existing technologies for crop improvement. Our results demonstrate that GIGS is active across a range of plant species, evidence similar to recent findings in an insect system, which suggests that GIGS is potentially active across many eukaryotes.</p>",2021-05-20

Although the strength and spatial scale of neural synchronization varies dramatically with sensory and behavioral context, the circuit mechanisms that regulate the magnitude and spatial spread of neural oscillations are largely unknown. As in humans, monkeys, and cats, we found that in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) the stimulus properties and behavioral state powerfully modulate gamma band synchronization. To reveal the underlying circuit that mediates this dependence, we used multi-site multi-electrode electrophysiology and cell type specific optogenetic suppression of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) interneurons in awake mice. Our results show that VIP neurons potently control the gain and behavioral state-dependence of gamma band network synchronization by desynchronizing local and global networks on fine time scales. Importantly, VIP neurons preferentially decouple spatially separated cortical ensembles when they are processing non-matched stimulus features. Based on these data, we propose that cortical disinhibition by VIP interneurons fine-tunes the strength and spatial architecture of gamma-oscillating neural assemblies, which may facilitate the downstream generation of coherent visual percepts.</p>",2021-05-20

Understanding the genetic factors influencing the composition and dynamics of these repertoires is of major scientific and clinical importance. The chromosomal loci encoding for the variable regions of T and B cell receptors (TCRs and BCRs, respectively) are challenging to decipher due to repetitive elements and undocumented structural variants. To confront this challenge, AIRR-seq-based methods have been developed recently for B cells, enabling genotype and haplotype inference and discovery of undocumented alleles. Applying these methods to AIRR-seq data reveals a plethora of undocumented genomic variations. However, this approach relies on complete coverage of the receptors’ variable regions, and most T cell studies sequence only a small fraction of the variable region. Here, we adapted BCR inference methods to full and partial TCR sequences, and identified 38 undocumented polymorphisms in TRBV, 15 of them were also observed in genomic data assemblies. Further, we identified 31 undocumented 5’ UTR sequences. A subset of these inferences was also observed using independent genomic approaches.

Charbonneau'}, {'name': 'David G. Amaral'}, {'name': 'Eliza Bliss-Moreau'}]","<p>The established literature clearly demonstrates that whether or not monkeys are socially reared has long term consequences for their affective behavior. Yet, in the context of behavioral neuroscience and pharmacological studies, social context of adult animals is often ignored. When social context has been studied in adult monkeys, such studies have typically focused on welfare-related issues, as social isolation often leads to the development of abnormal behavior, rather than the impact on outcomes in behavioral neuroscience studies. Variation in social housing conditions for adult animals could have an impact on affective responding and may have significant implications for the interpretation of data from biopsychiatry and behavioral neuroscience studies. We evaluated the affective reactivity of rhesus monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) maintained in one of four housing conditions (individually-housed, grate-paired, intermittently-paired, and continuously-paired) using two classic threat processing tasks—a test of responsivity to objects and the Human Intruder Test. Individually-housed monkeys exhibited consistently blunted sensitivity to ostensibly threatening stimuli as compared to socially-housed monkeys. Within the three socially-housed conditions, intermittently- and continuously-paired monkeys behaved similarly to each other and grate-paired monkeys exhibited relatively enhanced sensitivity to threatening stimuli. These findings suggest that the adult housing conditions of monkeys can robustly modulate affective responding in a way that may be consistent with behavioral phenotypes observed in human psychiatric conditions. Results are considered in the context of the broad behavioral and psychiatric neuroscience literatures, which have historically used individually-housed animals, pointing to the potential need to reconsider inferences drawn from those studies.</p>",2021-05-17

Mutations in the RBD domain are present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that have emerged independently worldwide. For example, the more transmissible B.1.1.7 lineage has a mutation (N501Y) in its Spike RBD domain that enhances binding to ACE2. There are also ACE2 alleles in humans with mutations in the RBD binding site. Here we perform a detailed affinity and kinetics analysis of the effect of five common RBD mutations (K417N, K417T, N501Y, E484K and S477N) and two common ACE2 mutations (S19P and K26R) on the RBD/ACE2 interaction. We analysed the effects of individual RBD mutations, and combinations found in new SARS-CoV-2 variants first identified in the UK (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P1). Most of these mutations increased the affinity of the RBD/ACE2 interaction. The exceptions were mutations K417N/T, which decreased the affinity. Taken together with other studies, our results suggest that the N501Y and S477N mutations primarily enhance transmission, the K417N/T mutations facilitate immune escape, and the E484K mutation facilitates both transmission and immune escape.</p>",2021-05-18

We compare methods that utilize gene expression, biological networks, and chromatin accessibility data to identify eight sets of known reprogramming factors and comprehensively test parameter and pre-processing of input data to optimize performance of these methods. We find the best factor identification methods can identify an average of 50-60% of reprogramming factors within the top 10 candidates, and methods that use chromatin accessibility perform the best. Among the chromatin accessibility methods, complex methods DeepAccess and diffTF are more likely to consistently correctly rank the significance of transcription factor candidates within reprogramming protocols for differentiation.

In addition to their roles in developmental regulation, increasing evidence suggests that these hormones are involved in innate immunity processes, such as phagocytosis and the induction of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) production.  AMP regulation includes systemic responses and local responses, at surface epithelia that contact with the external environments. At pupariation, Drosophila melanogaster increases dramatically the expression of three AMP genes: drosomycin (drs), drosomycin-like 2 (drsl2) and drosomycin-like 5 (drsl5). Using D. melanogaster, we show that the expression of drs at pupariation is dependent on ecdysone signalling in the fat body. This systemic immune response involving drs expression in the fat body operates via the ecdysone downstream target, Broad-Z4. In parallel, ecdysone also regulates local responses, specifically through the activation of drsl2 expression in the gut. Finally, we establish the relevance of this ecdysone dependent AMP expression for the control of bacterial persistence by showing that flies lacking drs expression in the fat body have higher bacterial persistence over metamorphosis. Together, our data establishes a new role for ecdysone during pupariation. We propose that the co-option of immune mechanisms by the hormonal cascade responsible for controlling metamorphosis constitutes a pre-emptive mechanism to control bacterial numbers in the pupa and increase developmental success.</p>",2021-05-23

While fMRI almost systematically relies on the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast, there is an increasing interest in alternative methods that would not rely on neurovascular coupling. A promising but controversial such alternative is diffusion fMRI (dfMRI), which relies instead on dynamic fluctuations in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) due to microstructural changes underlying neuronal activity. However, it is unclear whether genuine dfMRI contrast, distinct from BOLD contamination, can be detected in the human brain in physiological conditions. Here, we present the first dfMRI study in humans attempting to minimize all BOLD contamination sources and comparing functional responses at two field strengths (3T and 7T), both for task and resting-state (RS) fMRI. Our study benefits from unprecedented high spatiotemporal resolution and harnesses novel denoising strategies. We report task-induced decrease in ADC with temporal and spatial features distinct from the BOLD response and yielding more specific activation maps. Furthermore, we report dfMRI RS connectivity which, compared to its BOLD counterpart, is essentially free from physiological artifacts and preserves positive correlations but preferentially suppresses anti-correlations, which are likely of vascular origin. A careful acquisition and processing design thus enable the detection of genuine dfMRI contrast on clinical MRI systems.

Formally, this effect is theorized to correspond to a reduction in the energy required to transition between different brain-states, i.e. a “flattening of the energy landscape.” However, this hypothesis remains thus far untested. Here, we leverage network control theory to map the brain’s energy landscape, by quantifying the energy required to transition between recurrent brain states.

However, it is not known whether the actions of ethanol on glutamatergic synapses are means by which chronic ethanol alters mechanisms of learning and memory in AIC as alcohol drinking transitions from controlled to problematic. We utilized the chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor model of ethanol exposure in adult male mice, alone or in combination with voluntary ethanol consumption, to determine whether glutamatergic synapses on layer 2/3 AIC pyramidal neurons are differentially regulated by different durations and intensities of chronic ethanol exposure. We observed evidence of both ethanol- and age-related metaplasticity of AIC layer 2/3 glutamatergic synapses, as only young adult, ethanol-naïve mice exhibited NMDAR-dependent long term depression ex vivo. Our findings also indicated that voluntary ethanol consumption alone can elicit glutamatergic plasticity in vivo. We found that the ratio of NMDAR- to AMPAR-mediated postsynaptic currents was reduced not only in CIE-treated, but also in air-treated, chronically drinking mice relative to ethanol-naïve controls. Furthermore, lower NMDA/AMPA ratios were predictive of greater escalation of ethanol consumption.

Mutations were introduced into the natural S protein until sequences were created that have a stable S-fold in their longer (∼90 amino acid) form and have an alternative fold (either A or B) in their shorter (56 amino acid) form. Five sequence pairs were designed and key structures were determined using NMR spectroscopy. Each protein pair is 100% identical in the 56 amino acid region of overlap. Several rules for engineering switches emerged. First, designing one sequence with good native state interactions in two folds requires care but is feasible. Once this condition is met, fold populations are determined by the stability of the embedded A- or B-fold relative to the S-fold and the conformational propensities of the ends that are generated in the switch to the embedded fold. If the stabilities of the embedded fold and the longer fold are similar, conformation is highly sensitive to mutation so that even a single amino acid substitution can radically shift the population to the alternative fold. The results provide insight into why dimorphic sequences can be engineered and sometimes exist in nature, while most natural protein sequences populate single folds. Proteins may evolve toward unique folds because dimorphic sequences generate interactions that destabilize and can produce aberrant functions. Thus, two-state behavior may result from nature’s negative design rather than being an inherent property of the folding code.</p><sec><title>Significance Statement</title><p>We establish general rules for designing protein fold switches by engineering dimorphic sequences that link the three most common small folds.

Rapid outbreak response vaccination is a strategy for measles control and elimination. Measles vaccines must be stored and transported within a specified temperature range, but this can present significant challenges when targeting remote populations. Measles vaccine licensure for delivery outside cold chain (OCC) could provide more vaccine transport/storage space without ice packs, and a solution to shorten response times. However, due to vaccine safety and wastage considerations, the OCC strategy will require other operational changes, potentially including the use of 1-dose (monodose) instead of 10-dose vials, requiring larger transport/storage equipment currently achieved with 10-dose vials. These trade-offs require quantitative comparisons of vaccine delivery options to evaluate their relative benefits. 
Methods
We developed a modelling framework combining elements of the vaccine supply chain - cold chain, vial, team, and transport equipment types - with a measles transmission dynamics model to compare vaccine delivery options. We compared 10 strategies resulting from combinations of the vaccine supply elements and grouped into three main classes: OCC, partial cold chain (PCC), and full cold chain (FCC). For each strategy, we explored a campaign with 20 teams sequentially targeting 5 locations with 100,000 individuals each. We characterised the time needed to freeze ice packs and complete the campaign (campaign duration), vaccination coverage, and cases averted, assuming a fixed pre-deployment delay before campaign commencement. We performed sensitivity analyses of the pre-deployment delay, population sizes, and two team allocation schemes. 
Results
The OCC, PCC, and FCC strategies achieve campaign durations of 50, 51, and 52 days, respectively. Nine of the ten strategies can achieve a vaccination coverage of 80%, and OCC averts the most cases. 

Discussion
The OCC strategy, therefore, presents improved operational and epidemiological outcomes relative to current practice and the other options considered.</p>",2021-05-21

Here, we use genome-wide metabolic modeling approaches to decompose the selective pressures driving enzymatic specificity for coenzymes in the metabolic network of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Flux balance modeling predicts that only two enzymes (encoded by <italic>leuB</italic> and <italic>pdxB</italic>) are thermodynamically constrained to use NAD(H) over NADP(H). In contrast, structural and sequence analyses reveal widespread conservation of residues that retain selectivity for NAD(H), suggesting that additional forces drive enzyme specificity. Using a model accounting for the cost of oxidoreductase enzyme expression, we find that coenzyme redundancy universally reduces the minimal amount of protein required to catalyze coenzyme-coupled reactions, inducing individual reactions to strongly prefer one coenzyme over another when reactions are near thermodynamic equilibrium. We propose that partitioning of flux across multiple coenzyme pools could be a generic phenomenon of cellular metabolism, and hypothesize that coenzymes typically thought to exist in a single pool (e.g., CoA) may exist in more than one form (e.g., dephospho-CoA).</p>",2021-05-18

The current study extends these findings to human cognitive aging and suggests that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques like quantitative relaxometry can be used to study iron and its effects in vivo. The effects of iron on microstructure and memory performance were examined using a combination of quantitative relaxometry and multi-compartment diffusion imaging in 35 young (21.06 +/- 2.18 years) and 28 older (72.58 +/- 6.47 years) adults, who also completed a memory task. Replicating past work, results revealed age-related increases in iron content (R2*) and diffusion, and decreases in memory performance. Independent of age group, iron content was significantly related to restricted (intracellular) diffusion in regions with low-moderate iron (hippocampus, caudate) and to all diffusion metrics in regions with moderate-high iron (putamen, globus pallidus). This pattern is consistent with different stages of iron-related gliosis, ranging from astrogliosis that may influence intracellular diffusion to microglial proliferation and increased vascular permeability that may influence all sources of diffusion. Further, hippocampal restricted diffusion was significantly related to memory performance, with a third of this effect related to iron content; consistent with the hypothesis that higher iron-related astrogliosis in the hippocampus is associated with poorer memory performance. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of MRI to iron-related gliosis and extends our understanding of its impact on cognition by showing that this relationship also explains individual differences in memory performance.</p>",2021-05-21

Moore'}, {'name': 'Nicole M. Long'}]","<p>Overlap between events can lead to interference due to a tradeoff between encoding the present event and retrieving the past event. Temporal context information – ‘when’ something occurred, a defining feature of episodic memory – can cue retrieval of a past event. However, the influence of temporal overlap, or proximity in time, on the mechanisms of interference are unclear. Here, by identifying brain states using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) from male and female human subjects, we show the extent to which temporal overlap promotes interference and induces retrieval. In this experiment, subjects were explicitly directed to either encode the present event or retrieve a past, overlapping event while perceptual input was held constant. We find that the degree of temporal overlap between events leads to selective interference. Specifically, greater temporal overlap between two events leads to impaired memory for the past event selectively when the top-down goal is to encode the present event. Using pattern classification analyses to measure neural evidence for a retrieval state, we find that greater temporal overlap leads to automatic retrieval of a past event, independent of top-down goals. Critically, the retrieval evidence we observe likely reflects a general retrieval mode, rather than retrieval success or effort. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the role of temporal overlap on interference and memory formation.</p>",2021-05-18

Methods: This is a single-blinded parallel-randomized controlled trial. The participants were randomized equally into the intervention group received Sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (S.L. group), and the control group received Oseltamivir, Hydroxychloroquine, and Azithromycin (OCH group). The primary outcomes were the cure rate over time and the incidence of serious adverse events. The secondary outcomes included the laboratory findings.
Results: Two hundred and fifty patients were divided equally into each group. Both groups were similar regarding gender, but age was higher in the S.L. group (p=0.001). In the S.L. group, 89 (71.2%) patients were cured, while only 51 (40.8%) patients were cured in the OCH group. The cure rate was significantly higher in the S.L. group (RR=1.75, p&lt;0.001).

We simulated: 1) individual and cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infection risks from close contact (droplet and aerosols at 1-3m), aerosol, and fomite-mediated exposures to a susceptible worker following exposure to an infected worker during an 8h-shift; and 2) the relative reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection risk attributed to infection control interventions (physical distancing, mask use, ventilation, surface disinfection, hand hygiene).

Contact mixing plays a key role in the spread of COVID-19. Thus, mobility restrictions of varying degrees up to and including nationwide lockdowns have been implemented in over 200 countries. To appropriately target the timing, location, and severity of measures intended to encourage social distancing at a country level, it is essential to predict when and where outbreaks will occur, and how widespread they will be. 

Methods
We analyze aggregated, anonymized health data and cell phone mobility data from Israel. We develop predictive models for daily new cases and the test positivity rate over the next 7 days for different geographic regions in Israel. We evaluate model goodness of fit using root mean squared error (RMSE). We use these predictions in a five-tier categorization scheme to predict the severity of COVID-19 in each region over the next week. We measure magnitude accuracy (MA), the extent to which the correct severity tier is predicted.

Results
Models using mobility data outperformed models that did not use mobility data, reducing RMSE by 17.3% when predicting new cases and by 10.2% when predicting the test positivity rate. The best set of predictors for new cases consisted of 1-day lag of past 7-day average new cases, along with a measure of internal movement within a region. The best set of predictors for the test positivity rate consisted of 3-days lag of past 7-day average test positivity rate, along with the same measure of internal movement. Using these predictors, RMSE was 4.812 cases per 100,000 people when predicting new cases and 0.79% when predicting the test positivity rate. MA in predicting new cases was 0.775, and accuracy of prediction to within one tier was 1.0. MA in predicting the test positivity rate was 0.820, and accuracy to within one tier was 0.998.

Conclusions
Using anonymized, macro-level data human mobility data along with health data aids predictions of when and where COVID-19 outbreaks are likely to occur. Our method provides a useful tool for government decision makers, particularly in the post-vaccination era, when focused interventions are needed to contain COVID-19 outbreaks while mitigating the collateral damage of more global restrictions.</p>",2021-05-21

Large-scale GWAS cohorts are necessary to identify target regions given the typically modest genetic effect sizes. In this context, two-phase sampling design and analysis is a cost-reduction technique that utilizes data collected during phase 1 GWAS to select an informative subsample for phase 2 sequencing. The main goal is to make inference for genetic variants measured via NGS by efficiently combining data from phases 1 and 2. We propose two approaches for selecting a phase 2 design under a budget constraint. The first method identifies sampling fractions that select a phase 2 design yielding an asymptotic variance covariance matrix with certain optimal characteristics, e.g. smallest trace, via Lagrange multipliers (LM). The second relies on a genetic algorithm (GA) with a defined fitness function to identify exactly a phase 2 subsample. We perform comprehensive simulation studies to evaluate the empirical properties of the proposed designs for a genetic association study of a quantitative trait. We compare our methods against two ranked designs: residual-dependent sampling and a recently identified optimal design. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed designs, GA in particular, can render competitive power in combined phase 1 and 2 analysis compared to alternative designs while preserving type 1 error control.

altitudes?

Summary answer: A top candidate region associated with preeclampsia containing clotting
factor genes PROZ, F7 and F10 was found on chromosome 13 of the fetal genome in affected
Andean families.

What is known already: Preeclampsia, a multi-organ complication of pregnancy, is a leading
cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Diagnosed by the onset of maternal
hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation, this disorder is a common cause of
preterm delivery and affects approximately 5-7% of global pregnancies. The heterogeneity of
preeclampsia has posed a challenge in understanding its etiology and molecular basis.
However, risk for the condition is known to increase in high altitude regions such as the
Peruvian Andes.

Study design, size, duration: To investigate the genetic basis of preeclampsia in a high-altitude
resident population, we characterized genetic diversity in a cohort of Andean families (N=883)
from Puno, Peru, a high-altitude city above 3,500 meters. Our study collected DNA samples
and medical records from case-control trios and duos between 2011-2016, thus allowing for
measurement of maternal, paternal, and fetal genetic factors influencing preeclampsia risk.

Participants/materials, setting, methods: We generated high-density genotype data for
439,314 positions across the genome, determined ancestry patterns and mapped associations
between genetic variants and preeclampsia phenotype. We also conducted fine mapping of
potential causal variants in a subset of family participants and tested ProZ protein levels in post-
partum maternal and cord blood plasma by ELISA.

Main results and the role of chance: A transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) revealed variants
near genes of biological importance in pregnancy physiology for placental and blood vessel
function. The most significant SNP in this cluster, rs5960 (p&lt;6x10-6) is a synonymous variant in
the clotting factor F10. Two other members of the coagulation cascade, F7 and PROZ, are also
in the top associated region. However, we detected no difference of PROZ levels in maternal or
umbilical cord plasma.

Limitations, reasons for caution: Our genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) was limited by
a small sample size and lack of functional follow up. Our ELISA was limited to post-natal blood
sampling (only samples collected immediately after birth). But, despite a small sample size, our
family based GWAS design permits identification of novel significant and suggestive
associations with preeclampsia. Further longitudinal studies could analyze clotting factor levels
and activity in other pregnant cohorts in Peru to assess the impact of thrombosis in
preeclampsia risk among Andean highlanders.

Wider implications of the findings: These findings support previous evidence suggesting that
coagulation plays an important role in the pathology of preeclampsia and potentially underlies
susceptibility to other pregnancy disorders exacerbated at high altitudes. This discovery of a
novel association related to a functional pathway relevant to pregnancy biology in an
understudied population of Native American origin demonstrates the increased power of
family-based study design and underscores the importance of conducting genetic research in
diverse populations.</p>",2021-05-21

Tests that detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigen in clinical specimens from the upper respiratory tract can provide a rapid means of COVID-19 disease diagnosis and help identify individuals that may be infectious and should isolate to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. This systematic review assesses the diagnostic accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection in COVID-19 symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals compared to RT-qPCR, and summarizes antigen test sensitivity using meta-regression. In total, 83 studies were included that compared SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen lateral flow testing (RALFT) to RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2. Generally, the quality of the evaluated studies was inconsistent, nevertheless, the overall sensitivity for RALFT was determined to be 75.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 71.0-78.0). Additionally, RALFT sensitivity was found to be higher for symptomatic versus asymptomatic individuals and was higher for a symptomatic population within 7 days from symptom onset (DSO) compared to a population with extended days of symptoms. Viral load was found to be the most important factor for determining SARS-CoV-2 antigen test sensitivity. Other design factors, such as specimen storage and anatomical collection type, also affect the performance of RAFLT. RALFT and RT-qPCR testing both achieve high sensitivity when compared to SARS-CoV-2 viral culture.</p>",2021-05-22

While it is thought that signals from the niche are actively required to prevent differentiation, another model proposes that stem cells can reversibly transit between multiple states, some of which are primed, but not committed, to differentiate. In the Drosophila testis, somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs) generate cyst cells, which encapsulate the germline to support its development. We find that CySCs are maintained independently of niche self-renewal signals if activity of the PI3K/Tor pathway is inhibited. Conversely, PI3K/Tor is not sufficient alone to drive differentiation, suggesting that it acts to license cells for differentiation. Indeed, we find that the germline is required for differentiation of CySCs in response to PI3K/Tor elevation, indicating that final commitment to differentiation involves several steps and intercellular communication. We propose that CySC daughter cells are plastic, that their fate depends on the availability of neighbouring germ cells, and that PI3K/Tor acts to induce a primed state for CySC daughters to enable coordinated differentiation with the germline.</p>",2021-05-20

We verify ACE2 and DPP4 as entry receptors for SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV respectively. SARS-CoV-2 replication in IOs does not require the endosomal Cathepsin B/L proteases, but specifically depends on the cell surface protease TMPRSS2. Other TMPRSS family members were not essential. The newly emerging coronavirus variant B.1.1.7, as well as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV similarly depended on TMPRSS2. These findings underscore the relevance of non-transformed human models for coronavirus research, identify TMPRSS2 as an attractive pan-coronavirus therapeutic target, and demonstrate that an organoid knockout biobank is a valuable tool to investigate the biology of current and future emerging coronaviruses.</p>",2021-05-20

Here we describe the methodology, how vulnerability is distributed across the U.S., and assess the impact on vulnerable communities over the first year of the pandemic.
Methods: The index combines 40 indicators into seven themes, drawing on both public and proprietary data. We associate timeseries of COVID-19 cases, deaths, test site access, and rental arrears with vulnerability.
Results: Although overall COVID-19 vulnerability is concentrated in the South, the seven underlying themes show substantial spatial variability. As of May 13, 2021, the top-third of vulnerable counties have seen 21% more cases and 47% more deaths than the bottom-third of vulnerable counties, despite receiving 27% fewer tests (adjusted for population). Individual vulnerability themes vary over time in their relationship with mortality as the virus swept across the country. Over 20% of households in the top vulnerability tercile have fallen behind on rent. Poorer test site access for rural vulnerable populations early in the pandemic has since been alleviated.
Conclusion: The CCVI captures greater risk of health and economic impact. It has enjoyed widespread use in response planning, and we share lessons learned about developing a data-driven tool in the midst of a fast-moving pandemic. The CCVI and an interactive data explorer are available at precisionforcovid.org/ccvi.</p>",2021-05-20

Respiration modulates the heart rate creating excess power in the heart rate variability at a frequency equal to the respiratory rate, a phenomenon known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia. We isolate this component from the power spectral density of the heart beat interval time series, and show that the respiratory rate thus estimated is in good agreement with a validation dataset acquired from sleep studies (root mean squared error = 0.648 min<sup>−1</sup>, mean absolute percentage error = 3%). Using the same respiratory rate algorithm, we investigate population level characteristics by computing the respiratory rate from 10,000 individuals over a 14 day period, with equal number of males and females ranging in age from 20 - 69 years. 90% of respiratory rate values for healthy adults fall within the range 11.8 min<sup>−1</sup> 19.2 min<sup>−1</sup> with a mean value of 15.4 min<sup>−1</sup>. Respiratory rate is shown to increase with nocturnal heart rate. It also varies with BMI, reaching a minimum at 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and increasing for lower and higher BMI. The respiratory rate decreases slightly with age and is higher in females compared to males for age &lt; 50 years, with no difference between females and males thereafter. The 90% range for the coefficient of variation in a 14 day period for females (males) varies from 2.3%−9.2% (2.3%−9.5%) for ages 20−24 yr, to 2.5%−16.8% (2.7%−21.7%) for ages 65−69 yr. We show that respiratory rate is often elevated in subjects diagnosed with COVID-19.

Understanding disease pathology and the factors that drive severe and fatal clinical outcomes is of special relevance. Studying the role of the respiratory microbiota in COVID-19 is particularly important since it is known that the respiratory microbiota interacts with the host immune system, contributing to clinical outcomes in chronic and acute respiratory diseases. Here, we characterized the microbiota in the respiratory tract of patients with mild, severe, or fatal COVID-19, and compared with healthy controls and patients with non-COVID-19-pneumonia. We comparatively studied the microbial composition, diversity, and microbiota structure across study groups and correlated the results with clinical data. We found differences in diversity and abundance of bacteria between groups, higher levels of dysbiosis in the respiratory microbiota of COVID-19 patients (regardless of severity level), differences in diversity structure among mild, severe, and fatal COVID-19, and the presence of specific bacteria that correlated with clinical variables associated with increased mortality risk.  Our data suggest that host-related and environmental factors could be affecting the respiratory microbiota before SARS-CoV-2 infection, potentially compromising the immunological response of the host against disease and promoting secondary bacterial infections. For instance, the high levels of dysbiosis coupled with low microbial structural complexity in the respiratory microbiota of COVID-19 patients, possibly resulted from antibiotic uptake and comorbidities, could have consequences for the host and microbial community level.

Participants: Semi-structured online focus groups were held with key stakeholders, i.e. family members who had experienced young SCD, healthcare professionals and researchers. Guided discussions were used to develop an online support intervention. Thematic analysis of discussions and iterative feedback on draft materials guided content development. 
Results: Four focus groups were held (10-12 participants per group). Stakeholder involvement facilitated development of high-level ideas and priority issues. Creative content and materials were developed based on user preference for stories, narratives and information reflecting everyday experience of families navigating the legal and medical processes surrounding SCD, normalising and supporting grief responses in the context of family relationships, and fostering hope.

In this retrospective, descriptive ecological study, we utilized Google Trends (GT) to characterize the second COVID-19 wave and its association with official case counts based on search terms related to symptoms, testing, disease complications, medications, preventive behaviors, and healthcare utilization.

Methods: GT is a publicly available, online tracking system of Google searches. Searches are presented as relative search volumes (RSV) from 0 (least) to 100 (most number of searches). We performed pre-defined Web searches in India from 2/12/2021 to 5/09/2021. We characterized the peak RSV, RSV doubling rates, and Spearman rank correlation of selected search terms with official case counts. We also used date-adjusted linear regression to estimate the association between highly correlated search terms and official case counts. We then qualitatively classified public search queries into thematic groups to better understand public awareness and needs related to COVID-19.

Results: We observed that searches for symptoms (most searched terms in order: fever, cough, headache, fatigue, chest pain), disease states (infection, pneumonia), COVID-19-related medications (remdesivir, ivermectin, azithromycin, Fabiflu, dexamethasone), testing modalities (PCR, CT Scan, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, oxygen saturation), healthcare utilization (oxygen cylinders, hospital, physician), and preventive behaviors (lockdown, mask, pulse oximetry, hand sanitizer, quarantine) all demonstrated increases, in line with increases in official case counts. Symptoms, PCR testing, outpatient medications, and preventive behaviors peaked around April 24th, approximately two weeks prior to the peak RSV in official case counts. Contrarily, healthcare utilization factors, including searches for hospital, physicians, beds, disease states, and inpatient medications did not peak until the first week of May. There were highly significant correlations between ""Coronavirus Disease 2019"" (r=0.959), ""fever"" (r=0.935), ""pulse oximetry"" (r=0.952), ""oxygen saturation"" (r=0.944), ""C-reactive protein"" (r=0.955), ""D-Dimer"" (r=0.945), &amp; ""Fabiflu"" (r=0.943) and official case counts.

Conclusion: GT search terms related to symptoms, testing, and medications are highly correlated with official case counts in India, suggesting need for further studies examining GT's potential use as a disease surveillance and public informant tool for public health officials.</p>",2021-05-21

Methods: Samples were obtained from a previously conducted study of male Sprague-Dawley rats that received dose fractionated polymyxin B (12 mg/kg/day subcutaneously) once daily (QD), twice daily (BID), and thrice daily (TID) for three days. In the original study, urinary biomarkers and kidney histopathology scores were determined. Urine was sampled daily and analyzed for urinary metabolites via 1H NMR analysis. Unsupervised Principal Components Analysis was applied for exploratory data analysis to identify trends and outliers in the spectral data. Then, supervised Orthogonal Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis was applied to classify the samples collected in different days and identify metabolic differences during the treatment. Metabolomes were compared across study groups (i.e. those receiving QD, BID, TID, and control) using a mixed-effects models. Spearman correlation was performed for injury biomarkers and the metabolome.
Results: A total of 27 rats contributed 77 urinary samples; n=25 rats were included that were treated with Polymyxin B and n=2 received saline. Pre-dosing samples clustered well and were characterized by higher amounts of citrate, 2-oxoglutarate, and Hippurate. On day 1 post treatment, day 1 samples showed higher taurine; day 3 samples had higher lactate, acetate and creatine. Taurine was the only metabolite significantly increased in both BID and TID compared to QD group. Taurine on day 1 correlated with increasing histopathology scores (Spearman's rho = 0.4167, P=0.038) and KIM-1 (Spearman's rho =0.4052, P=0.036); whereas KIM-1 on day one and day 3 did not reach significance with histopathology (Spearman's rho = 0.3248, P=0.11 and Spearman's rho = 0.3739, P=0.066).
Conclusion: Polymyxin B causes increased amounts of urinary taurine on day 1 which then normalizes to baseline concentrations. Taurine may provide one of the earlier signals of acute kidney damage caused by polymyxin B.</p>",2021-05-22

Although lung cancer is highly associated with smoking status, a significant proportion of lung cancer cases develop in patients who never smoked, with an observable bias towards female never smokers. A better understanding of lung cancer heterogeneity and immune system involvement during tumour evolution and progression in never smokers is therefore highly warranted. We employed single nucleus transcriptomics of surgical lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) and normal lung tissue samples from patients with or without smoking history. Immune cells as well as fibroblasts and endothelial cells respond to tobacco smoke exposure by inducing a highly inflammatory state in normal lung tissue. In the presence of LADC, we identified differentially expressed transcriptional programmes in macrophages and cancer-associated fibroblasts, providing insight into how the niche favours tumour progression. Within tumours, we distinguished eight subpopulations of neoplastic cells in female smokers and never smokers. Through pseudotemporal ordering, we inferred a trajectory towards two differentiated tumour cell states implicated in cancer progression and invasiveness. A proliferating cell population sustaining tumour growth exhibits differential immune modulating signatures in both patient groups. Our results resolve cellular heterogeneity and immune interactions in LADC, with a special emphasis on female never smokers and implications for the design of therapeutic approaches.</p>",2021-05-18
