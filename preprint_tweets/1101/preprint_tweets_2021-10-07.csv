Here, we evaluate the use of AlphaFold 2 (AF2) predictions in the study of characteristic structural elements; the impact of missense variants; function and ligand binding site predictions; modelling of interactions; and modelling of experimental structural data. For 11 proteomes, an average of 25% additional residues can be confidently modelled when compared to homology modelling, identifying structural features rarely seen in the PDB. AF2-based predictions of protein disorder and protein complexes surpass state-of-the-art tools and AF2 models can be used across diverse applications equally well compared to experimentally determined structures, when the confidence metrics are critically considered.

Using several live imaging approaches in <italic>klc4</italic> mutant zebrafish, we show that KLC4 is required for stabilization of nascent axon branches and for proper microtubule (MT) dynamics. Furthermore, KLC4 is required for the contact repulsion necessary for tiling of peripheral axon arbors: in <italic>klc4</italic> mutants, peripheral axons showed abnormal fasciculation, a behavior characteristic of central axons, suggesting that KLC4 patterns axonal compartments and helps define axon identity.

AAVs are widely used in research and are the basis of multiple FDA-approved gene therapies. Here, we find that the immune response to AAV’s genome reduces dendritic complexity in mammalian cortex. Dendritic loss associated with AAV-mediated gene delivery occurs at experimentally-relevant titers, cannot be explained by responses to transgene expression or surgery, and is not restricted to a particular capsid serotype, encoded transgene, promoter, or production facility. AAV-associated dendritic loss is accompanied by a decrease in the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and upregulation of immune molecules that can limit dendritic complexity and synaptic transmission. Blocking detection of unmethylated CpG-rich DNA via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) protects dendritic complexity, suggesting that immunodetection of a core feature of the AAV genome triggers dendritic loss. These results reveal previously unsuspected impacts of AAV on neuronal structure and function and identify TLR9 inhibitors as important tools to improve the safety and efficacy of AAV-mediated gene delivery in the nervous system.</p>",2021-09-30

Here we isolated and serologically characterized SARS-CoV-2 which evolved from an ancestral strain in a person with advanced HIV disease and delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance. This virus showed evolving escape from self antibody neutralization immunity and decreased Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine neutralization sensitivity. We mapped neutralization of evolved virus and ancestral, beta and delta variant viruses by antibodies elicited by each VOC in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals. Beta virus showed moderate (7-fold) and delta slight escape from neutralizing immunity elicited by ancestral virus infection. In contrast, delta virus had stronger escape from beta elicited immunity (12-fold), and beta virus even stronger escape from delta immunity (34-fold). Evolved virus had 9-fold escape from ancestral immunity, 27-fold escape from delta immunity, but was effectively neutralized by beta immunity. We conclude that beta and delta are serologically distant, further than each is from ancestral, and that virus evolved in prolonged infection during advanced HIV disease is serologically close to beta and far from delta.

We further illustrate the generality and applicability of the methodology established by performing an analysis of the attack ratio of COVID-19 among children in the Canadian population.

We first establish the validity of this approach in both neuroimaging domains by relating neural complexity measures to pre-existing techniques for capturing transitions of consciousness from full wakefulness into drowsiness and the earliest stages of sleep, finding decreased complexity as participants become increasingly drowsy. We further demonstrate that neural complexity measures in both MEG and fMRI change both within and between tasks, and relate to performance on an executive task, with higher complexity associated with better performance and faster reaction times.

Distinct patterns of variability in membership coefficients can be produced for different groups of individuals, for example, representing different predefined populations, sampling sites, or time periods. Such variability can be difficult to capture in a single numerical value; membership coefficient vectors are multivariate and potentially incommensurable across groups, as the number of clusters over which individuals are distributed can vary among groups of interest. Further, two groups might share few clusters in common, so that membership coefficient vectors are concentrated on different clusters. We introduce a method for measuring the variability of membership coefficients of individuals in a predefined group, making use of an analogy between variability across individuals in membership coefficient vectors and variation across populations in allele frequency vectors.

However, many natural environments are highly constrained, such as a system of burrows, or of paths through the underbrush. More generally, many cognitive tasks are equally constrained, allowing only a small set of actions at any given stage in the process.

However, we argue that measuring raw dissimilarity alone is insufficient, as it confuses a variety of interesting and uninteresting changes. To address this problem, we examine brain pattern changes that are consistent across people. We show that temporal compression in individuals’ retelling of past events predicts systematic encoding-to-recall transformations in a number of higher associative regions.

The initial important step of analyzing scRNA-seq data is usually to accurately annotate cells. The traditional approach of annotating cell types based on unsupervised clustering and marker genes is time-consuming and laborious. Taking advantage of the numerous existing scRNA-seq databases, many supervised label assignment methods have been developed. One feature that many label assignment methods shares is to label cells with low confidence as “unassigned.” These unassigned cells can be the result of assignment difficulties due to highly similar cell types or caused by the presence of unknown cell types. However, when unknown cell types are not expected, existing methods still label a considerable number of cells as unassigned, which is not desirable. In this work, we develop a neural network-based cell annotation method called NeuCA (Neural network-based Cell Annotation) for scRNA-seq data obtained from well-studied tissues. NeuCA can utilize the hierarchical structure information of the cell types to improve the annotation accuracy, which is especially helpful when data contain closely correlated cell types.

Although the BLA is a putative storage site for aversive memory, recent evidence suggests that these memories undergo time-dependent reorganization and no longer require the BLA after the passage of time. To explore this question, we systematically examined the role for the BLA in recent and remote fear memory using optogenetic, electrophysiological, and calcium imaging methods in male and female Long-Evans rats. Critically, we used a behavioral design that permits within-subjects comparison of recent and remote memory at the same time point. We found that BLA c-Fos expression was similar after the retrieval of recent (1 day) or remote (2 weeks) fear memories. Extracellular recordings in awake, behaving animals revealed that the majority of BLA neurons encoded both recent and remote memories, suggesting substantial overlap in the allocation of temporally distinct events. Fiber photometric recordings of BLA principal neurons also revealed similar patterns of CS-evoked activity to recent and remote CSs. Consistent with these results, continuous or CS-specific optogenetic inhibition of BLA principal neurons impaired conditioned freezing to both recent and remote CSs. Collectively, these data reveal that single BLA neurons encode both recent and remote fear memories. This may underlie the broad generalization of fear memories across both space and time. Ultimately, these results provide robust evidence that the BLA is a long-term storage site for emotional memories.</p>",2021-09-27

We find that, unlike what would be expected under models of demographic changes alone, strongly deleterious mutations show the biggest difference between ploidy levels, and this effect diminishes for moderately and mildly deleterious mutations. We further show that the proportion of nonsynonymous mutations that are deleterious differs between the two co-resident subgenomes in the allopolyploids, suggesting that homoeologous masking acts unequally between subgenomes. Our results provide a genome-wide perspective on classic notions of the significance of gene duplication that likely are broadly applicable to allopolyploids, with implications for our understanding of the evolutionary fate of deleterious mutations. Finally, we note that some measures of selection (e.g. dN/dS, <bold>π</bold><sub>N</sub>/<bold>π</bold><sub>S</sub>) may be biased when species of different ploidy levels are compared.</p>",2021-09-24

Model-based population genetic methods that infer recombination rates from patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the genome have become a popular method to estimate rates of recombination. However, these LD-based methods make a variety of simplifying assumptions about the populations of interest that are often not met in natural populations. One such assumption is the absence of gene flow from other populations. Here, we use forward-time population genetic simulations of isolation-with-migration scenarios to explore how gene flow affects the accuracy of LD-based estimators of recombination rate. We find that moderate levels of gene flow can result in either the overestimation or underestimation of recombination rates by up to 20-50% depending on the timing of divergence. We also find that these biases can affect the detection of interpopulation differences in recombination rate, causing both false positive and false negatives depending on the scenario. We discuss future possibilities for mitigating these biases and recommend that investigators exercise caution and confirm that their study populations meet assumptions before deploying these methods.</p>",2021-09-26

For different reasons, an important amount of individuals is reluctant to get the vaccine, something that hinders our ability to control and - eventually - eradicate the disease. In this work, we analyze the impact that this hesitancy might have in a context in which a more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern spreads through a partially vaccinated population. We use age-stratified data from surveys on vaccination acceptance, together with age-contact matrices to inform an age-structured SIR model set in the US.

By employing enhanced focused ion beam – scanning electron microscopy on samples with optimally preserved ultrastructure, we discovered synapses between the serotonergic axons arising from the brainstem, and the primary cilia of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Functionally, these cilia are enriched in a ciliary-restricted serotonin receptor, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 6 (HTR6), whose mutation is associated with learning and memory defects. Using a newly developed cilia-targeted serotonin sensor, we show that optogenetic stimulation of serotonergic axons results in serotonin release onto cilia. Ciliary HTR6 stimulation activates a non-canonical G<sub>αq/11</sub>-RhoA pathway. Ablation of this pathway results in nuclear actin and chromatin accessibility changes in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Axo-ciliary synapses serve as a distinct mechanism for neuromodulators to program neuron transcription through privileged access to the nuclear compartment.</p>",2021-09-28

We leverage the unique genomic diversity of the patient population in ATLAS to explore the interplay between self-reported race/ethnicity and genetic ancestry within a disease context using phenotypes extracted from the EHR. First, we identify an extensive amount of continental and subcontinental genomic diversity within the ATLAS data that is consistent with the global diversity of Los Angeles; this includes clusters of ATLAS individuals corresponding to individuals with Korean, Japanese, Filipino, and Middle Eastern genomic ancestries. Most importantly, we find that common diseases and traits stratify across genomic ancestry clusters, thus suggesting their utility in understanding disease biology across diverse individuals. Next, we showcase the power of genetic data linked with EHR to perform ancestry-specific genome and phenome-wide scans to identify genetic factors for a variety of EHR-derived phenotypes (phecodes). For example, we find ancestry-specific associations for liver disease, and link the genetic variants with neurological and neoplastic phenotypes primarily within individuals of admixed ancestries.

Despite an ever-growing interest in their biotechnological and therapeutic applications, detailed knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying phage-host interactions remains scarce. Here, we show that bacteriophage N4 exploits a novel surface glycan, NGR, as a receptor to infect its host <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. We demonstrate that this process is regulated by the second messenger c-di-GMP and that N4 infection is specifically stimulated by the diguanylate cyclase DgcJ while the phosphodiesterase PdeL effectively protects <italic>E. coli</italic> from N4-mediated killing. PdeL-mediated protection requires its catalytic activity to reduce c-di-GMP and includes a secondary role as a transcriptional repressor.

However, the assumption that turning up and down emotions produces opposite effects in the same affect-generating regions is untested. We call this assumption the ‘affective dial hypothesis.’ Our study tested this hypothesis by examining the overlap between the sets of regions activated during up-regulation and those deactivated during down-regulation in a large number of participants (N=105). We found that up- and down-regulation both recruit regulatory regions such as the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus but act on distinct affect-generating regions. While up-regulation increases BOLD signal in regions associated with emotion such as the amygdala, anterior insula, striatum and anterior cingulate gyrus as well as in regions associated with sympathetic vascular activity such as periventricular white matter, down-regulation decreases signal in regions receiving interoceptive input such as the posterior insula and postcentral gyrus.

Countering the hypothesis, our findings indicate that up- and down-modulating emotions target different brain areas. Thus, the mechanisms underlying emotion regulation differ more than previously appreciated for up- versus down-regulation. In addition to their theoretical importance, these findings are critical for researchers attempting to target activity in particular brain regions during an emotion regulation intervention.</p></sec>",2021-09-23

This revealed neural representations of behavior on multiple spatial and temporal scales. The activity of most neurons across the brain correlated (or, in some cases, anticorrelated) with running and flailing over timescales that ranged from seconds to almost a minute. Grooming elicited a much weaker global response. Although these behaviors accounted for a large fraction of neural activity, residual activity not directly correlated with behavior was high dimensional. Many dimensions of the residual activity reflect the activity of small clusters of spatially organized neurons that may correspond to genetically defined cell types. These clusters participate in the global dynamics, indicating that neural activity reflects a combination of local and broadly distributed components.

In practice, however, interpretation of ancient polygenic scores is subject to numerous assumptions. For one, the genome-wide association (GWA) studies from which polygenic scores are derived, can only estimate effect sizes for loci segregating in contemporary populations. Therefore, a GWA study may not correctly identify all loci relevant to trait variation in the ancient population. In addition, the frequencies of trait-associated loci may have changed in the intervening years. Here, we devise a theoretical framework to quantify the effect of this allelic turnover on the statistical properties of polygenic scores as functions of population genetic dynamics, trait architecture, power to detect significant loci, and the age of the ancient sample. We model the allele frequencies of loci underlying trait variation using the Wright-Fisher diffusion, and employ the spectral representation of its transition density to find analytical expressions for several error metrics, including the correlation between an ancient individual’s polygenic score and true phenotype, referred to as polygenic score accuracy. Our theory also applies to a two-population scenario and demonstrates that allelic turnover alone <italic>may</italic> explain a substantial percentage of the reduced accuracy observed in cross-population predictions, akin to those performed in human genetics. Finally, we use simulations to explore the effects of recent directional selection, a bias-inducing process, on the statistics of interest. We find that even in the presence of bias, weak selection induces minimal deviations from our neutral expectations for the decay of polygenic score accuracy. By quantifying the limitations of polygenic scores in an explicit evolutionary context, our work lays the foundation for the development of more sophisticated statistical procedures to analyze both temporally and geographically resolved polygenic scores.</p>",2021-09-24

Recent advances in 3D docking simulations have not solved this problem, given that 3D protein structures with sufficient resolution are not always available and that they are computationally expensive to obtain. Here we have developed LIGHTHOUSE, a graph-based deep learning approach for discovery of the hidden principles underlying the association of small-molecule compounds with target proteins, and we present its validation by identifying potential therapeutic compounds for various human diseases. Without any 3D structural information for proteins or chemicals, LIGHTHOUSE estimates protein-compound scores that incorporate known evolutionary relations and available experimental data. It identified novel therapeutics for cancer, lifestyle-related disease, and bacterial infection. Moreover, LIGHTHOUSE predicted ethoxzolamide as a therapeutic for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and this agent was indeed effective against alpha, beta, gamma, and delta variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that are rampant worldwide. Given that ethoxzolamide is already approved for several diseases, it could be rapidly deployed for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

Here, we investigate the mechanisms involved in binding based on neutron crystallography studies of a fully deuterated LecB/fucose/calcium complex. The neutron structure, which includes the positions of all the hydrogen atoms, reveals that the high affinity of binding may be related to the occurrence of a low barrier hydrogen bond induced by the proximity of the two calcium ions, the presence of coordination rings between the sugar, calcium and LecB, and the dynamic behaviour of bridging water molecules at room temperature.

The molecular mechanisms governing tolerance remain poorly understood. A prominent type of β-lactam tolerance relies on the formation of cell wall-deficient spheroplasts, which maintain structural integrity via their outer membrane (OM), an asymmetric lipid bilayer consisting of phospholipids on the inner leaflet and a lipid-linked polysaccharide (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) enriched in the outer monolayer on the cell surface. How a membrane structure like LPS, with its reliance on mere electrostatic interactions to maintain stability, is capable of countering internal turgor pressure is unknown. Here, we have uncovered a novel role for the PhoPQ two-component system in tolerance to the β-lactam antibiotic meropenem in Enterobacterales. We found that PhoPQ is induced by meropenem treatment and promotes an increase in 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-aminoarabinose [L-Ara4N] modification of lipid A, the membrane anchor of LPS. L-Ara4N modifications enhance structural integrity, and consequently tolerance to meropenem, in several Enterobacterales species. Importantly, mutational inactivation of the negative PhoPQ regulatory element <italic>mgrB</italic> (commonly selected for during clinical therapy with the last-resort antibiotic colistin, an antimicrobial peptide [AMP]) results in dramatically enhanced tolerance, suggesting that AMPs can collaterally select for meropenem tolerance via stable overactivation of PhoPQ. Lastly, we identify histidine kinase inhibitors (including an FDA-approved drug) that inhibit PhoPQ-dependent LPS modifications and consequently potentiate meropenem to enhance killing of tolerant cells. In summary, our results suggest that PhoPQ-mediated LPS modifications play a significant role in stabilizing the OM, promoting survival when the primary integrity maintenance structure, the cell wall, is removed.</p><sec><title>Significance</title><p>Treating an infection with an antibiotic often fails, resulting in a tremendous public health burden.

In addition to modifications in the ligand binding properties of receptors, chemosensory receptor evolution is characterized by copy number changes, often resulting in large gene family size differences between species [8–13]. Though chemosensory receptor expansions and contractions are frequently described, it is unknown how this is accompanied by changes in the neural circuitry in which they are expressed. Among <italic>Drosophila</italic>’s chemosensory receptor families, the Odorant receptors (Ors) are ideal for addressing this question because, other than an essential co-receptor (Orco [14]), a large majority of Ors are uniquely expressed in single olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) populations. Between-species changes in Or copy number, therefore, may indicate diversification or reduction of peripheral sensory neuron populations. To test this possibility, we focused on a rapidly duplicated/deleted Or subfamily - named <italic>Or67a</italic> - within <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and its most closely-related sister species (<italic>D. simulans, D. sechellia</italic>, and <italic>D. mauritiana</italic>). Evolutionary genetic analyses and <italic>in vivo</italic> physiological assays demonstrate that the common ancestor of these four species possessed three <italic>Or67a</italic> paralogs that had already diverged adaptively in their odor-evoked responses.

Thus, while neuroanatomy is conserved between these species, independent selection on co-expressed receptors has contributed to species-specific peripheral coding of olfactory information. This work reveals a model of adaptive change previously not considered for olfactory evolution and raises the possibility that similar processes may be operating among the largely uninvestigated cases of Or co-expression [2, 15–18].</p>",2021-09-22

Hebart'}]","<p>Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) has emerged as a popular method for relating representational spaces from human brain activity, behavioral data, and computational models. RSA is based on the comparison of representational dissimilarity matrices (RDM), which characterize the pairwise dissimilarities of all conditions across all features (e.g. fMRI voxels or units of a model). However, classical RSA treats each feature as equally important. This ‘equal weights’ assumption contrasts with the flexibility of multivariate decoding, which reweights individual features for predicting a target variable. As a consequence, classical RSA may lead researchers to underestimate the correspondence between a model and a brain region and, for model comparison, it may lead to selecting the inferior model. While previous work has suggested that reweighting can improve model selection in RSA, it has remained unclear to what extent these results generalize across datasets and data modalities. To fill this gap, the aim of this work is twofold: First, utilizing a range of publicly available datasets and three popular deep neural networks (DNNs), we seek to broadly test feature-reweighted RSA (FR-RSA) applied to computational models and reveal the extent to which reweighting model features improves RDM correspondence and affects model selection. Second, we propose voxel-reweighted RSA, a novel use case of FR-RSA that reweights fMRI voxels, mirroring the rationale of multivariate decoding of optimally combining voxel activity patterns. We find that reweighting individual model units (1) markedly improves the fit between model RDMs and target RDMs derived from several fMRI and behavioral datasets and (2) affects model selection, highlighting the importance of considering FR-RSA. For voxel-reweighted RSA, improvements in RDM correspondence were even more pronounced, demonstrating the utility of this novel approach. We additionally demonstrate that classical noise ceilings can be exceeded when FR-RSA is applied and propose an updated approach for their computation. Taken together, our results broadly validate the use of FR-RSA for improving the fit between computational models, brain and behavioral data, possibly allowing us to better adjudicate between competing computational models. Further, our results suggest that FR-RSA applied to brain measurement channels could become an important new method to assess the match between representational spaces.</p>",2021-09-28

There was, however, no significant difference compared to a cohort of HIV-uninfected individuals vaccinated with the same regimen. Responses to the variants of concern were detectable, although were lower than wild type. Pre-existing cross-reactive T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike were associated with greater post-vaccine immunity and correlated with prior exposure to beta coronaviruses. These data support the on-going policy to vaccinate PWH against SARS-CoV-2, and underpin the need for long-term monitoring of responses after vaccination.</p>",2021-09-29

The range of long-distance sRNA mediated signaling from the vasculature to the shoot apical meristem (SAM) is not clear. To investigate this, two independent transgenic approaches were used to examine trafficking of phloem-expressed sRNA to the SAM in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. First, the phloem companion-cell specific promoter <italic>SUC2</italic> was used to drive expression of an inverted repeat complementary to <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS D</italic> (<italic>FD)</italic>, a flowering time regulator expressed exclusively in the SAM.

Both systems provide evidence of a phloem-to-SAM sRNA communication axis connecting distal regions of the plant to the stem cells of the SAM, which ultimately gives rise to all shoot tissues, including gametes. Thus, phloem-to-SAM sRNA movement defines an important link between sRNA expressed in distal regions of the plant and the growing shoot. Importantly, phloem-to-SAM sRNA trafficking may allow somatic sRNA to direct SAM RdDM, fixing transient sRNA expression events into stable epigenetic changes.</p>",2021-09-20

A population of sensory neurons labeled by the G-protein coupled receptor Mrgprb4 detect stroking touch in mice<sup>1,2</sup>.

In the absence of Mrgprb4-lineage neurons, female mice no longer find male mounts rewarding: sexual receptivity is supplanted by aggression and a coincident decline in dopaminergic release in the mesolimbic reward pathway. In addition to sexual behavior, Mrgprb4-lineage neurons are also required for social postures induced by female-to-female back touch.

The mechanisms underlying the correct A-P regionalisation of human NC cells remain elusive. Recent studies have indicated that trunk NC cells, the presumed precursors of the childhood tumour neuroblastoma, are derived from neuromesodermal-potent progenitors of the postcranial body (NMPs). Here we employ human embryonic stem cell differentiation to define how NMP-derived NC cells acquire a posterior axial identity. We show that TBXT, a pro-mesodermal transcription factor, mediates early posterior NC regionalisation together with WNT signalling effectors. This occurs by TBXT-driven chromatin remodelling via its binding in key enhancers within HOX gene clusters and other posterior regulator-associated loci. In contrast, posteriorisation of NMP-derived spinal cord cells is TBXT/WNT-independent and takes place under the influence of FGF signalling. Our work reveals a previously unknown role of TBXT in influencing posterior NC fate and points to the existence of temporally discrete, cell type-dependent modes of posterior axial identity control.</p>",2021-09-24

This process of decomposing signals is challenging when component signals interfere with each other. For example, when a mixture of signals does not equal the sum of its parts, this leads to an unpredictable corruption of signal patterns, making the target recognition harder. In olfaction, nonlinear summation is prevalent at various stages of sensory processing, from stimulus transduction in the nasal epithelium to higher areas, including the olfactory bulb (OB) and the piriform cortex. Here, we investigate how the olfactory system deals with binary mixtures of odours, using two-photon imaging with several behavioural paradigms. Unlike previous studies using anaesthetised animals, we found the mixture summation to be substantially more linear when using awake, head-fixed mice performing an odour detection task. This linearisation was also observed in awake, untrained mice, in both engaged and disengaged states, revealing that the bulk of the difference in mixture summation is explained by the brain state. However, in the apical dendrites of M/T cells, mixture representation is dominated by sublinear summation.

We found that CSE1 is mainly cytoplasmic during interphase and in early regeneration, and then accumulates inside the macronucleus during condensation.

However, the precise roles of individual parasite kinases cannot be inferred simply from sequence identity, due to rewiring of signaling pathways and the shifting repertoire of kinases across species. To systematically examine the parasite kinome, we developed a high-throughput (HiT) CRISPR-mediated tagging strategy to endogenously label all predicted cytosolic protein kinases with a synthetic sequence encoding the minimal auxin-inducible degron (mAID) linked to a fluorophore and epitope tag. The system enables the assembly of thousands of tagging vectors from synthetic sequences in a single reaction and the pooled generation of mutants to examine kinase localization and function. We examined the phenotypes associated with kinase knock-down in 1,160 arrayed clones by replica-plating in the presence or absence of auxin and found broad defects across the lytic cycle for 109 clonal isolates, assigning localizations to 39 proteins, and associating 15 kinases within 6 distinct morphological phenotypes. The relative fitness of tagged alleles was also examined by tracking the relative abundance of individual guide RNAs as parasite populations progressed through the lytic cycle, in the presence or absence of auxin. Pooled screening had a high predictive value and differentiated between delayed and acute death. Demonstrating the value of this resource, we identified a novel kinase associated with delayed death as a novel regulator of invasion and egress. We call the previously unstudied kinase Store Potentiating/Activating Regulatory Kinase (SPARK), based on its impact on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores at key moments during the lytic cycle. Despite having a similar kinase domain to the mammalian PDK1, SPARK lacks the canonical lipid-binding domain and we find no indication SPARK positively regulates other AGC kinases, suggesting a rewiring of signaling pathways to accommodate parasite adaptations.

Previous genomic studies focused on describing only the tumor cell morphology factor, although we robustly find the three other sources in all publicly available cohorts. We prove how these sources of variation explain the biological functions performed by the cancer cells, and how genomic events shape MPM molecular profiles.

Here, we investigated whether female rats escalate self-administration of methylone, 3,4-methylenedioxypentedrone (pentylone), and MDMA and then studied consequences of MDMA and pentylone self-administration on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor and kappa opioid receptor (KOR) signaling in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), a brain area critically dysregulated by extended access self-administration of alcohol or cocaine. Adult female Wistar rats were trained to self-administer methylone, pentylone, MDMA (0.5 mg/kg/infusion), or saline-vehicle using a fixed-ratio 1 response contingency in 6-hour sessions (long-access: LgA) followed by progressive ratio (PR) dose-response testing. The effects of pentylone-LgA, MDMA-LgA and saline on basal GABAergic transmission (miniature postsynaptic inhibitory currents, mIPSCs) and the modulatory role of KOR at CeA GABAergic synapses were determined in acute brain slices using whole-cell patch-clamp. Methylone-LgA and pentylone-LgA rats similarly escalated their drug intake (both obtained more infusions compared to MDMA-LgA rats) however, pentylone-LgA rats reached higher breakpoints in PR tests. At the cellular level, baseline CeA GABA transmission was markedly elevated in pentylone-LgA and MDMA-LgA rats compared to saline-vehicle. Specifically, pentylone-LgA was associated with increased CeA mIPSC frequency (GABA release) and amplitude (postsynaptic GABAA receptor function), while mIPSC amplitudes (but not frequency) was larger in MDMA-LgA rats compared to saline rats. In addition, pentylone-LgA and MDMA-LgA profoundly disrupted CeA KOR signaling such as both KOR agonism (1mM U50488) and KOR antagonism (200nM nor-binaltorphimine) decreased mIPSC frequency suggesting recruitment of non-canonical KOR signaling pathways. This study confirms escalated self-administration of entactogen psychostimulants under LgA conditions in female rats which is accompanied by increased CeA GABAergic inhibition and altered KOR signaling.

Next, participants were asked to verbally recall the movie events, taking into account the new “twist” information. Most participants updated their recall to incorporate the twist. Two additional groups recalled the movie without having to update their memories during recall: one group never saw the twist; another group was exposed to the twist prior to the beginning of the movie, and thus the twist information was incorporated both during encoding and recall. We found that providing participants with information about the twist beforehand altered neural response patterns during movie-viewing in the default mode network (DMN). Moreover, presenting participants with the twist at the end of the movie changed the neural representation of the previously-encoded information during recall in a subset of DMN regions. Further evidence for this transformation was obtained by comparing the neural activation patterns during encoding and recall and correlating them with behavioral signatures of memory updating.

A key step in TPD is the formation of an induced proximity complex where a degrader molecule recruits an E3 ligase to the protein of interest (POI), facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to the POI and initiating the proteasomal degradation process. Here, we address three critical aspects of the TPD process using atomistic simulations: 1) formation of the ternary complex induced by a degrader molecule, 2) conformational heterogeneity of the ternary complex, and 3) degradation efficiency via the full Cullin Ring Ligase (CRL) macromolecular assembly. The novel approach described here combines experimental biophysical data with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to accurately predict ternary complex structures at atomic resolution. We integrate hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS, which measures the solvent exposure of protein residues) directly into the MD simulation algorithm to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the ternary structure predictions of the bromodomain of the cancer target SMARCA2 with the E3 ligase VHL, as mediated by three different degrader molecules. The simulations accurately reproduce X-ray crystal structures–including a new structure that we determined in this work (PDB ID: 7S4E)–with root mean square deviations (RMSD) of 1.1 to 1.6 Å. The simulations also reveal a structural ensemble of low-energy conformations of the ternary complex. Snapshots from these simulations are used as seeds for additional simulations, where we perform 5.7 milliseconds of aggregate simulation time using Folding@home, the world’s largest distributed supercomputer. The detailed free energy surface captures the crystal structure conformation within the low-energy basin and is consistent with solution-phase experimental data (HDX-MS and SAXS). Finally, we graft a structural ensemble of the ternary complexes onto the full CRL and perform enhanced sampling simulations. Our results suggest that differences in degradation efficiency may be related to the proximity distribution of lysine residues on the POI relative to the E2-loaded ubiquitin. We make source code and the simulation and experimental datasets from this work publicly available for researchers to further advance the field of induced proximity modulation.</p>",2021-09-26

Thus, it is worth interrogating whether there is crosstalk between inhibitors and substrates between these enzymes. Here, we found that the clinically-approved FXa inhibitor apixaban targets SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> with a 21-fold higher potency than boceprevir (GC376). Apixaban displayed a non-competitive mechanism of inhibition towards M<sup>pro</sup>, since it targets the enzyme/substrate complex and the allosteric site onto the viral protease. Enzymatic assays were further validated in infected Calu-3 cells, which reveal that apixaban decreases the production of infectious viral particles in a dose-dependent manner, with an inhibitory potency in the micromolar range. Our results are in line with the proposed early use of anticoagulants, including FXa inhibitors, to improve clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. In this context, apixaban may display a dual mechanism of action by targeting FXa to prevent coagulopathy and, at some level, SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup>.</p>",2021-09-24

Ryan'}]","<p>Scene construction is a key component of memory recall, navigation, and future imagining, and relies on the medial temporal lobes (MTL). A parallel body of work suggests that eye movements may enable the imagination and construction of scenes, even in the absence of external visual input. There are vast structural and functional connections between regions of the MTL and those of the oculomotor system. However, the directionality of connections between the MTL and oculomotor control regions, and how it relates to scene construction, has not been studied directly in human neuroimaging. In the current study, we used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to investigate this relationship at a mechanistic level using a scene construction task in which participants’ eye movements were either restricted (<italic>fixed-viewing</italic>) or unrestricted (<italic>free-viewing</italic>). By omitting external visual input, and by contrasting free-versus fixed-viewing, the directionality of neural connectivity during scene construction could be determined. As opposed to when eye movements were restricted, allowing free viewing during construction of scenes strengthened top-down connections from the MTL to the frontal eye fields, and to lower-level cortical visual processing regions, suppressed bottom-up connections along the visual stream, and enhanced vividness of the constructed scenes. Taken together, these findings provide novel, non-invasive evidence for the causal architecture between the MTL memory system and oculomotor system associated with constructing vivid mental representations of scenes.</p>",2021-09-24

However, the PPA also exhibits preferences for low-level contour statistics, including rectilinearity and cardinal orientations, that are not directly predicted by theories of scene- and landmark-selectivity. It is unknown whether these divergent findings of both low- and high-level selectivity in the PPA can be explained by a unified computational theory. To address this issue, we fit hierarchical computational models of mid-level tuning to the image-evoked fMRI responses of the PPA, and we performed a series of high-throughput experiments on these models. Our findings show that hierarchical encoding models of the PPA exhibit emergent selectivity across multiple levels of complexity, giving rise to high-level preferences along dimensions of real-world size, fixedness, and naturalness/animacy as well as low-level preferences for rectilinear shapes and cardinal orientations. These results reconcile disparate theories of PPA function in a unified model of mid-level visual representation, and they demonstrate how multifaceted selectivity profiles naturally emerge from the hierarchical computations of visual cortex and the natural statistics of images.</p><sec><title>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</title><p>Visual neuroscientists characterize cortical selectivity by identifying stimuli that drive regional responses. A perplexing finding is that many higher-order visual regions exhibit selectivity spanning multiple levels of complexity: they respond to highly complex categories, such as scenes and landmarks, but also to surprisingly simplistic features, such as specific contour orientations. Using large-scale computational analyses and human brain imaging, we show how multifaceted selectivity in scene-preferring cortex can emerge from the coding of mid-level visual features, whose complexity is neither as simple as local contours nor as complex as scenes or objects. Our work reconciles seemingly divergent findings of selectivity in scene-preferring cortex and suggests that mid-level features may be central to understanding the category-selective organization of the human visual system.</p></sec>",2021-09-25

Public health interventions in response to burgeoning case numbers and hospitalizations have repeatedly bent down the epidemic curve in many jurisdictions, effectively creating a closed-loop dynamic system. We aim to formalize and illustrate how to incorporate principles of feedback control into pandemic projections and decision making.
Starting with a SEEIQR epidemiological model, we illustrate how feedback control can be incorporated into pandemic management using a simple design (proportional-integral or PI control), which couples recent changes in case numbers or hospital occupancy with explicit policy restrictions. We then analyse a closed-loop system between the SEEIQR model and the designed feedback controller to illustrate the potential benefits of pandemic policy design that incorporates feedback.
We first explored a feedback design that responded to hospital measured infections, demonstrating robust ability to control a pandemic despite simulating large uncertainty in reproduction number R0 (range: 1.04-5.18) and average time to hospital admission (range: 4-28 days). The second design compared responding to hospital occupancy to responding to case counts, showing that shorter delays reduced both the cumulative case count and the average level of interventions. Finally, we show that feedback is robust to changing public compliance to public health directives, and to systemic changes associated with new variants of concern and with the introduction of a vaccination program.
The negative impact of a pandemic on human health and societal disruption can be reduced by coupling models of disease propagation with models of the decision-making process. This creates a closed-loop system that better represents the coupled dynamics of a disease and public health responses. Importantly, we show that feedback control is robust to delays in both measurements and responses, and to uncertainty in model parameters and the efficacy of control measures.</p>",2021-09-24

This joint-wide injection also confirmed that the MAMCs do not elicit an inflammatory response. In the contralateral hindlimbs, chondral defects were created, MAMCs were locally administered, and nanofracture (Nfx), a clinically utilized method to promote cartilage repair, was performed. The NFx holes enabled marrow-derived stromal cells to enter the defect area and served as repeatable bone injury sites to monitor over time. Animals were evaluated 1 and 2 weeks after injection and surgery. Analysis of injected MAMCs showed that bioactive cargo was released in a controlled fashion over 2 weeks. A bone fluorochrome label injected at the time of surgery displayed maintenance of mineral labeling in the therapeutic group, but resorption in both control groups. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining at the osteochondral interface revealed higher AP activity in defects treated with therapeutic MAMCs. Overall, this study establishes a new micro-fluidically generated delivery platform that releases therapeutic factors in an articulating joint, and reduces this to practice in the delivery of therapeutics that preserve bone structure after osteochondral injury.</p>",2021-09-24

However, the impacts of these processes on perilacunar bone quality are not understood. It is well established that aging is associated with reduced whole-bone fracture resistance, reduced osteocyte viability, and truncated LCS geometries, but it remains unclear if aging changes perilacunar bone quality. In this study, we employed atomic force microscopy (AFM) to quantify sub-micrometer gradations from 2D maps surrounding osteocyte lacunae in young (5 mo) and aged (22 mo) female mice. AFM-mapped lacunae were also imaged with confocal laser scanning microscopy to determine which osteocytes had recently deposited bone as determined by the presence of fluorochrome labels. These assays allowed us to quantify gradations in nanoscale mechanical properties of bone-forming/non-bone-forming osteocytes in young and aged mice. This study reports for the first time that there are sub-micrometer gradations in modulus surrounding lacunae and that these gradations are dependent upon recent osteocyte bone formation. Perilacunar bone adjacent to bone-forming osteocytes demonstrated lower peak and bulk modulus values when compared to bone near non-bone-forming osteocytes from the same mouse. Bone-forming osteocytes also showed increased perilacunar modulus variability. Age reduced lacunar size but did not significant effect modulus gradation or variability. In general, lacunar morphology was not a strong predictor of modulus gradation patterns. These findings support the idea that lacunar-canalicular remodeling activity changes the material properties of surrounding bone tissue on a sub-micrometer scale.

However, existing methods for conducting TWAS do not take full advantage of the intra-individual correlation inherently present in multi-context expression studies and do not properly adjust for multiple testing across contexts. We developed CONTENT— a computationally efficient method with proper cross-context false discovery correction that leverages correlation structure across contexts to improve power and generate context-specific and context-shared components of expression. We applied CONTENT to bulk multi-tissue and single-cell RNA-seq data sets and show that CONTENT leads to a 42% (bulk) and 110% (single cell) increase in the number of genetically predicted genes relative to previous approaches. Interestingly, we find the context-specific component of expression comprises 30% of heritability in tissue-level bulk data and 75% in single-cell data, consistent with cell type heterogeneity in bulk tissue.

We tested 252 genera, spanning most families of large-bodied moths, and outline anti-bat ultrasound production in 52 genera, with eight new subfamily origins described.

To explore the possible organization of anti-bat warning sounds into acoustic mimicry rings, we intensively studied a community of moths in Ecuador and found five distinct acoustic clusters using machine learning algorithms.

Competing theories of gaze guidance consider the factors driving eye movements within a dichotomy between low-level visual features and high-level object representations. However, recent developments in object perception indicate a complex and intricate relationship between features and objects. Specifically, image-independent object-knowledge can generate objecthood by dynamically reconfiguring how feature space is carved up by the visual system. Here, we adopt this emerging perspective of object perception, moving away from the simplifying dichotomy between features and objects in explanations of gaze guidance. We recorded eye movements in response to stimuli that appear as meaningless patches on initial viewing but are experienced as coherent objects once relevant object-knowledge has been acquired. We demonstrate that gaze guidance differs substantially depending on whether observers experienced the same stimuli as meaningless patches or organized them into object representations. In particular, fixations on identical images became object-centred, less dispersed, and more consistent across observers once exposed to relevant prior object-knowledge. Observers’ gaze behaviour also indicated a shift from exploratory information-sampling to a strategy of extracting information mainly from selected, object-related image areas. These effects were evident from the first fixations on the image. Importantly, however, eye-movements were not fully determined by object representations but were best explained by a simple model that integrates image-computable features and high-level, knowledge-dependent object representations. Overall, the results show how information sampling via eye-movements in humans is guided by a dynamic interaction between image-computable features and knowledge-driven perceptual organization.</p>",2021-09-24

Chromosomal instability (CIN), resulting in aneuploidy and genomic rearrangements, is the central pathway of mismatch repair-proficient colorectal cancer pathogenesis; however, it is unknown whether CIN impacts the outcomes of patients with limited spread of CRCLM treated with curative intent cytotoxic chemotherapy and surgery. Herein, we examined the relationship between CIN and the molecular subtypes of CRCLM, immune signaling, treatment sensitivity, and patient outcomes in three independent CRCLM patient cohorts. We established that a previously developed 70-gene CIN signature (CIN70) is a reliable measure of CIN, encompassing features of both aneuploidy and cellular proliferation. We demonstrated that tumors with the canonical subtype of CRCLM exhibit elevated levels of CIN and aneuploidy. Genomically unstable tumors were associated with an immune-depleted tumor microenvironment, and patients with genomically unstable tumors were at increased risk for disease progression in adverse metastatic sites, resulting in poor progression-free and overall survival. However, high-CIN tumors were particularly susceptible to DNA-damaging chemotherapies, including topoisomerase inhibitors, as well as radiation therapy. Treatment with genotoxic agents depleted CIN-rich cell populations, which resulted in a concomitant increase in intratumoral CD8+ T-cells in patients with primary rectal, breast, and bladder cancer.

How the Kalotermitidae have acquired their global distribution patterns remains unresolved. Similarly, it is unclear whether foraging is ancestral to Kalotermitidae or was secondarily acquired in a few species. These questions can be addressed in a phylogenetic framework. We inferred time-calibrated phylogenetic trees of Kalotermitidae using mitochondrial genomes and nuclear ribosomal RNA genes of ∼120 species, about 27% of kalotermitid diversity, including representatives of 22 of the 23 kalotermitid genera. We found that extant kalotermitids shared a common ancestor 81 Mya (72–91 Mya 95% HPD), indicating that a few disjunctions among early-diverging kalotermitid lineages may predate Gondwana breakup. However, most of the ∼40 disjunctions among biogeographic realms were dated at less than 50 Mya, indicating that transoceanic dispersals, and more recently human-mediated dispersals, have been the major drivers of the global distribution of Kalotermitidae. Our phylogeny also revealed that the capacity to forage is often found in early-diverging kalotermitid lineages, implying that the ancestors of Kalotermitidae were able to forage among multiple wood pieces.

However, recent quantitative studies questioned these hypotheses based on new findings that humans are not necessarily unique in certain eye features compared to other great ape species. Therefore, there is currently a heated debate on whether external eye features of humans are distinguished from those of other apes and how such distinguished features contribute to the visibility of eye-gaze direction. This study leveraged updated image analysis techniques to test the uniqueness of human eye features in facial images of great apes. Although many eye features were similar between humans and other species, a key difference was that humans have uniformly white sclera which creates clear visibility of both eye outline and iris –the two essential features contributing to the visibility of eye-gaze direction. We then tested the robustness of the visibility of these features against visual noises such as darkening and distancing and found that both eye features remain detectable in the human eye, while eye outline becomes barely detectable in other species under these visually challenging conditions. Overall, we identified that humans have distinguished external eye morphology among other great apes, which ensures robustness of eye-gaze signal against various visual conditions.

Soft robotics’ mimicry of naturally complex biomechanics makes them ideal platforms for exerting mechanical stimuli for patient-specific tissue maturation and disease modeling applications. Such platforms are essential for emulating highly flexible tissues such as the kneecap’s femoropopliteal artery (FPA), one of the most flexible arteries in the body, which flexes and bends during walking, standing, and crouching movements. The FPA is a frequent site of disease, where 80% of all peripheral artery diseases manifest, affecting over 200 million people worldwide. The complex biomechanical and hemodynamic forces within the FPA have been implicated in the frequent occurrence of PAD and lead to debilitating morbidities, such as limb-threatening ischemia. To better mimic these complex biomechanics, we developed an <italic>in-vitro</italic> bio-hybrid soft robot (BSR). First, Platsil OO-20 was identified as an ideal hyperelastomer for both cell culture and BSR fabrication using 3D printed molds.

Pressurizing the BSR PneuNets enabled a range of mechanical stimuli to be dynamically applied during tissue culture to mimic normal and diseased FPA flexions during daily walking and sitting poses, the most extreme being radial distensions of 20% and angular flexions of 140°. Finally, these designed, manufactured, and programmed vascular BSRs were seeded with mesenchymal stem cells and conditioned for 24 hours to highlight the effect of dynamic conditioning on cultured cell alignment, as well as type IV collagen production and the upregulation of smooth muscle phenotypes.

This periodicity may be supported by brain oscillations at corresponding frequencies. We propose that part of the discrepancy in periodic frequencies observed in the literature is due to differences in attentional demands, resulting from heterogeneity in tasks performed. To test this hypothesis, we used visual search and manipulated task complexity, i.e., target discriminability (high, medium, low) and number of distractors (set size), while electro-encephalography was simultaneously recorded. We replicated previous results showing that the phase of pre-stimulus low-frequency oscillations predicts search performance. Crucially, such effects were observed at increasing frequencies within the theta-alpha range (6-18 Hz) for decreasing target discriminability. In medium and low discriminability conditions, correct responses were further associated with higher post-stimulus phase-locking than incorrect ones, in increasing frequency and latency. Finally, the larger the set size, the later the post-stimulus effect peaked. Together, these results suggest that increased complexity (lower discriminability or larger set size) requires more attentional cycles to perform the task, partially explaining discrepancies between reports of attentional sampling. Low-frequency oscillations structure the temporal dynamics of neural activity and aid top-down, attentional control for efficient visual processing.</p>",2021-09-24

Assembly of the MS ring, through oligomerization of FliF, is one of the first steps of basal body assembly.</p><p>Previous computational analysis had shown that the periplasmic region of FliF consists of three structurally similar domains, termed Ring-Building Motif (RBM)1, RBM2 and RBM3. The structure of the MS-ring has been reported recently, and unexpectedly shown that these three domains adopt different symmetries, with RBM3 having a 34-mer stoichiometry, while RBM2 adopts two distinct positions in the complex, including a 23-mer ring. This observation raises some important question on the assembly of the MS ring, and the formation of this symmetry mis-match within a single protein. In this study, we analyze the oligomerization of the individual RBM domains in isolation, in the <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> FliF orthologue. We demonstrate that the periplasmic domain of FliF assembles into the MS ring, in the absence of the trans-membrane helices. We also report that the RBM2 and RBM3 domains oligomerize into ring structures, but not RBM1. Intriguingly, we observe that a construct encompassing RBM1 and RBM2 is monomeric, suggesting that RBM1 interacts with RBM2, and inhibits its oligomerization. However, this inhibition is lifted by the addition of RBM3. Collectively, this data suggests a mechanism for the controlled assembly of the MS ring.</p>",2021-09-23

Negative immune regulation would therefore appear to be a clear candidate for a mechanism underlying disease tolerance but this has not been tested directly for bacterial infections.

To enable the high throughput interrogation of ISG antiviral functions in pooled genetic screens while mitigating the potentially confounding effects of endogenous IFN and potential antiproliferative/proapoptotic ISG activities, we adapted a CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa) system for inducible ISG induction in isogenic cell lines with and without the capacity to respond to IFN.

Yet, so far, flat genotypes have been demonstrated in very few cases, particularly in viruses. The quantitative conditions for their emergence were studied only in simplified single-locus, two-peak landscapes. In particular, it is unclear whether within the same genome some genes can be flat while the remaining ones are fit. Here, we analyze a previously measured fitness landscape of a yeast tRNA gene. We found that the wild type allele is sub-optimal, but is mutationally robust (‘flat’). Using computer simulations, we estimated the critical mutation rate in which transition from fit to flat allele should occur for a gene with such characteristics. We then used a scaling argument to extrapolate this critical mutation rate for a full genome, assuming the same mutation rate for all genes. Finally, we propose that while the majority of genes are still selected to be fittest, there are a few mutation hot-spots like the tRNA, for which the mutationally robust flat allele is favored by selection.</p>",2021-09-27

In addition to these symptoms, patients with CDI can develop severe inflammation and tissue damage, resulting in life-threatening toxic megacolon. CDI is mediated by two large homologous protein toxins, TcdA and TcdB, that bind and hijack receptors to enter host cells where they use glucosyltransferase (GT) enzymes to inactivate Rho family GTPases. GT-dependent intoxication elicits cytopathic changes, cytokine production, and apoptosis.

Target site insensitivity due to mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene and overproduction of metabolic detoxification enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenases play critical role in insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. To enhance the killing power of insecticides, synergized insecticides were developed by mixing insecticide synergists with pyrethroids. Discovered in the 1940s, piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is one of the earliest and most commonly used insecticide synergists. Field application of PBO-synergized insecticides performed far better than mono-pyrethroids. PBO-treated long-lasting insecticidal nets (PBO-LLINs), which also use pyrethroids, outperformed regular LLIN for malaria control in many African countries. PBO-LLIN is soon to be rolled out on a large scale for malaria control in Africa. One important question regarding the use of synergized insecticides is whether they will select for vector population resistance to synergized insecticide products, in other words, are PBO-synergized pyrethroids effective against highly insecticide-resistant mosquitoes?

Recent studies on GpsB, a protein conserved within the Firmicutes phylum, have provided insight into cell division regulation in <italic>S. aureus</italic> and other related organisms. It has been revealed that GpsB coordinates cell division and cell wall synthesis in multiple species by interacting with Penicillin Binding Proteins (PBPs) and other partners.

Different microtubule populations contribute to spindle function: Kinetochore microtubules attach and transmit forces to chromosomes, antiparallel interpolar microtubules support spindle structure, and astral microtubules connect spindle poles to the cell cortex [1,2]. In mammalian cells, End Binding (EB) proteins associate with all growing microtubule plus ends throughout the cell cycle and serve as adaptors for a diverse group of +TIPs that control microtubule dynamics and interactions with other intracellular structures [3]. Because binding of many +TIPs to EB1 and thus microtubule-end association is switched off by mitotic phosphorylation [4–6] the mitotic function of EBs remains poorly understood. To analyze how EB1 and associated +TIPs on different spindle microtubule populations contribute to mitotic spindle dynamics, we use a light sensitive EB1 variant, π-EB1, that allows local, acute and reversible inactivation of +TIP association with growing microtubule ends in live cells [7]. We find that acute π-EB1 photoinactivation results in rapid and reversible metaphase spindle shortening and transient relaxation of tension across the central spindle. However, in contrast to interphase, π-EB1 photoinactivation does not inhibit microtubule growth in metaphase, but instead increases astral microtubule length and number. Yet, in the absence of EB1 activity astral microtubules fail to engage the cortical dynein/dynactin machinery and spindle poles move away from regions of π-EB1 photoinactivation. In conclusion, our optogenetic approach reveals mitotic EB1 functions that remain hidden in genetic experiments likely due to compensatory molecular systems regulating vertebrate spindle dynamics.</p>",2021-10-01

A systematic review following international standards was conducted to comprehensively identify and synthesize research examining the effectiveness of filters within HVAC systems in reducing virus transmission. Twenty-three relevant studies showed that: filtration was associated with decreased transmission; filters removed viruses from the air; increasing filter efficiency (efficiency of particle removal) was associated with decreased transmission, decreased infection risk, and increased viral filtration efficiency (efficiency of virus removal); increasing filter efficiency above MERV 13 was associated with limited benefit in further reduction of virus concentration and infection risk; and filters with the same efficiency rating from different companies showed variable performance.

Mutator alleles have only been found to be co-selected by genetic linkage with adaptive alleles in prokaryotes. Sexual reproduction substantially reduces genetic linkage, allowing selection to effectively eradicate mutator alleles. The current understanding, therefore, is that in sexually reproducing populations selection always works to lower MR, limited by the effective population size that determines the overall selection efficiency. In the present paper, we apply a Monte Carlo model of a sexually reproducing population and demonstrate that selection acting on MR does not universally favor lower MR but depends on the mode of selection acting on adaptive phenotypic traits. We demonstrate a unique previously unreported co-selective process that can drive the evolution of higher MR in sexually reproducing populations. Our results show that MR evolution is significantly influenced by multigenic inheritance of both MR and adaptive traits that are under selection. Our results also show that, contrary to the generally accepted axiom, population size appears not to affect the strength of selection uniformly but likely forms an intra-population gradient that generates a “biased sampling” process that has an opposite effect on selection strength and thus modulates or even negates the effect of population size on MR evolution. Based on our results, we propose an expanded population genetics theory of the evolution of mutation rates in sexually reproducing organisms. Our results have potential implications for understanding processes underlying rapid adaptive change in speciation and related macroevolutionary patterns.</p>",2021-09-26

In this study, microcosms-based experiments were used to investigate the impact of electron donor mode (i.e., ammonia and urea) and loading on the population dynamics of nitrifying guilds in drinking water biofilter media.

Changes in comammox bacterial abundance were not correlated with either ammonia or nitrite oxidizing bacterial abundance in urea amended systems where metabolic reconstruction indicated potential cross feeding between ammonia and nitrite oxidizing bacteria.

Our results indicate that comammox bacteria will dominate nitrifier communities sourced from low nitrogen environments (e.g., drinking water) irrespective of fluctuations in nitrogen availability or source without directly competing with canonical ammonia oxidizers. However, canonical nitrite oxidizers are likely to get outcompeted by comammox bacteria in situations where metabolic interactions between ammonia and nitrite do not include cross feeding.</p></sec>",2021-09-29

In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the analysis of sex-biased microRNAs (short non-coding regulatory molecules) has revealed striking differences with protein-coding genes. Mainly, the X chromosome is enriched in male-biased microRNA genes, although it is depleted of male-biased protein-coding genes. The paucity of male-biased genes in the X chromosome is generally explained by an evolutionary process called demasculinization. I suggest that the excess of male-biased microRNAs in the X chromosome is due to high-rates of de novo emergence of microRNAs, a tendency of novel microRNAs in the X chromosome to be expressed in testis, and to a lack of a demasculinization process. To test this hypothesis I analysed the expression profile of microRNAs in males, females and gonads in <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>, in which an autosome translocated into the X chromosome effectively becoming part of a sex chromosome (neo-X). I found that the pattern of sex-biased expression is generally conserved between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>. Also, orthologous microRNAs in both species conserve their chromosomal location, indicating that there is no evidence of demasculinization or other inter-chromosomal movement of microRNAs. <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>-specific microRNAs in the neo-X chromosome tend to be male-biased and particularly expressed in testis.

By analysing the patterns of recent TE accumulation (TEs that are potentially currently active) in high-quality genome assemblies, we found that the shared genomic characteristics between long-lived species that are refractory to cancer, is the strong suppression, or negative selection against the accumulation, of non-LTR retrotransposons. All the short-lived species did show a recent accumulation of these TEs. Non-LTR retrotransposons have been often found to take part in the immune response of the host against viral infections, but their dysregulation can lead to phenomena of “sterile inflammation” and “inflammageing”. Therefore, we hypothesise that the uncontrolled non-LTR retrotransposon activity is an important factor explaining the evolution of shorter lifespans in both Rodents and Chiroptera species and potentially in all mammals.

These methods can be categorized into two types: database-based methods and alignmentfree methods. The database-based approach, such as VIBRANT, utilizes existing databases and compares sequence similarity between candidates and those in the databases.

Recent systematic studies to map the degradable kinome have shown differences in degradation between kinases with similar drug-target engagement, suggesting yet unknown factors influencing degradability. We therefore developed a machine learning model, MAPD (Model-based Analysis of Protein Degradability), to predict degradability from protein features that encompass post-translational modifications, protein stability, protein expression and protein-protein interactions. MAPD shows accurate performance in predicting kinases that are degradable by TPD compounds (auPRC=0.759) and is likely generalizable to independent non-kinase proteins. We found five features with statistical significance to achieve optimal prediction, with ubiquitination potential being the most predictive. By structural modeling, we found that E2-accessible ubiquitination sites, but not lysine residues in general, are particularly associated with kinase degradability. Finally, we extended MAPD predictions to the entire proteome to find 964 disease-causing proteins, including 278 cancer genes, that may be tractable to TPD drug development.</p>",2021-09-29

Currently, the best approach to evaluate the accuracy of a callset is the comparison against a well curated gold standard. In repetitive regions of the genome it may be difficult to establish what is the truth for a call, for example when different alignment scoring metrics provide equally supported but different variant calls in on the same data. Here we provide an alternative approach, TT-Mars, that takes advantage of the recent production of high-quality haplotype-resolved genome assemblies by evaluating variant calls based on how well their call reflects the content of the assembly, rather than comparing calls themselves. We used TT-Mars to assess callsets from different SV discovery methods on multiple human genome samples and demonstrated that it is capable at accurately classifying true positive and false positive SVs. On the HG002 personal genome, TT-Mars recapitulates 96.0%-99.6% of the validations made using the Genome in a Bottle gold standard callset evaluated by truvari, and evaluates an additional 121-10,966 variants across different callsets. Furthermore, with a group of high-quality assemblies, TT-Mars can evaluate performance of SV calling algorithms as a distribution rather than a point estimate. We also compare TT-Mars against the long-read based validation tool, VaPoR, and when assembly-based variant calls produced by dipcall are used as a gold standard. Compared with VaPoR, TT-Mars analyzes more calls on a long read callset by assessing more short variant calls (&lt; 100 bases), while requiring smaller input. Compared with validation using dipcall variants, TT-Mars analyzes 1,497-2,229 more calls on long read callsets and has favorable results when candidate calls are fragmented into multiple calls in alignments.

Bakdrive infers ecological networks of given metagenomic sequencing samples and identifies minimum sets of driver species using control theory. Bakdrive has three key innovations in this space: (i) it leverages inherent information from metagenomic sequencing samples to identify driver species, (ii) it explicitly takes host-specific variation into consideration, and (iii) it does not require a known ecological network.

Hundreds of ALD-causing mutations are identified on ALDP. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of these mutations are restricted to clinical description due to limited structural information. Furthermore, ALDP plays a role in myelin maintenance, which is tightly associated with axon regeneration. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human ALDP with nominal resolution of 3.4 Å in nucleotide free state. The structure of ALDP exhibits a typical assembly of ABC transporters. The nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) displays a ligand free state. ALDP exhibits an inward-open conformation to the cytosol. A short helix is located at the peroxisomal side, which is different from other three members of ABCD transporters. The two transmembrane domains (TMDs) of ALDP form a cavity, in which two lipid-like densities can be recognized as the head group of an coenzyme-A ester of a lipid.

However, the generalizability and mechanisms that underlie this association remain poorly defined. Here, we sought to identify a common pre-vaccination signature and mechanisms that could predict the immune response across a wide variety of vaccines. We leveraged the “Immune Signatures Data Resource” created by the NIH Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) to integrate data from 28 studies involving 13 different vaccines and associate the blood transcriptional status of 820 healthy young adults with their responses. An unsupervised analysis of blood transcriptional profiles across studies revealed three distinct pre-vaccination states, characterized by the differential expression of genes associated with a pro-inflammatory response, cell proliferation, and metabolism alterations downstream of NFκB and IRF7. Innate and adaptive immune cell subsetspecific genes were also associated with the three pre-vaccination states. Importantly, individuals whose pre-vaccination state was enriched in pro-inflammatory response genes known to be downstream of NFκB tended to have higher serum antibody responses one month after vaccination. A supervised analysis of the same data resulted in a single classifier, also enriched for NFκB regulated genes, that predicted the antibody response across most of the vaccines. Projection into single-cell RNA-sequencing data suggested that this pre-vaccination state was attributable to the signature of activation of non-classical monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells. Transcriptional signatures of recent exposure to bacterial and not viral infections were enriched in the high pro-inflammatory pre-vaccination state and also included NFκB regulated genes. The pro-inflammatory prevaccination state was highly reminiscent of the innate activation state triggered by TLR ligands or adjuvants. These results demonstrate that wide variations in the transcriptional state of the immune system in humans can be a key determinant of responsiveness to vaccination. They also define a transcriptional signature NFκB activation at baseline, that is associated with a greater magnitude of antibody response to 13 different vaccines, and suggest that modulation of the innate immune system by next-generation adjuvants targeting NFκB before vaccine administration may improve vaccine responsiveness.</p>",2021-09-26

It is, however, unclear if diversity of fungi is essential to fulfill this role. With this meta-analysis, we aim to understand the relationship between fungal diversity and decomposition of plant materials (leaf litter and wood) in terrestrial and aquatic environments. The selection criteria for papers were the presence of a fungal diversity gradient and quantification of decomposition as mass loss. In total 40 papers met the selection criteria. We hypothesized that increase of fungal species will result in stronger decomposition, especially in species poor communities. Both artificial inoculated and naturally assembled fungal communities were included in the analysis in order to assess whether manipulated experiments are representative for field situations. We found a significant positive effect of increased fungal diversity on decomposition. However, in manipulated experiments this relationship was only positive when a control treatment of one fungus was compared with multispecies communities. This relationship became negative when comparisons of higher initial richness (at least two fungal species as “control”) were included. In contrast, under natural field conditions increased fungal diversity coincided with increased decomposition. This suggests that manipulated experiments are not representative for field situations. Possible reasons for this are discussed.

By employing a template switching-based sequencing protocol, Nano3P-seq can sequence any given RNA molecule from its 3’end, regardless of its polyadenylation status, without the need of PCR amplification or ligation of RNA adapters. We demonstrate that Nano3P-seq captures a wide diversity of RNA biotypes, providing quantitative estimates of RNA abundance and tail lengths in mRNAs, lncRNAs, sn/snoRNAs, scaRNAs and rRNAs. We find that, in addition to mRNAs and lncRNAs, polyA tails can be identified in 16S mitochondrial rRNA in both mouse and zebrafish. Moreover, we show that mRNA tail lengths are dynamically regulated during vertebrate embryogenesis at the isoform-specific level, correlating with mRNA decay.

We focused on a subset of third-order glutamatergic lateral horn neurons (LHNs) and characterized their odor coding properties in relation to their presynaptic partner neurons, the projection neurons (PNs) by two-photon functional imaging. We found that odors evoke reproducible, stereotypic and odor-specific response patterns in LHNs. Notably, odor-evoked responses in these neurons are valence-specific in a way that their response amplitude is positively correlated with innate odor preferences. We postulate that this valence-specific activity is the result of integrating inputs from multiple olfactory channels through second-order neurons. GRASP and micro-lesioning experiments provide evidence that glutamatergic LHNs obtain their major excitatory input from uniglomerular PNs, while they receive an odor-specific inhibition through inhibitory multiglomerular PNs. In summary, our study indicates that odor representations in glutamatergic LHNs encode hedonic valence and odor identity and primarily retain the odor coding properties of second-order neurons.</p>",2021-10-01

The approved vaccines are lifesaving yet temporary solutions to such a devastating pandemic. Viroporins are important players of the viral life cycle of SARS-Cov-2 and one of the primary determinants of its pathogenesis. We studied the two prominent viroporins of SARS-CoV-2 (i) Orf3a and (ii) Envelope (E) protein from a structural point of view. Orf3a has several hotspots of mutations which has been reported in SARS-CoV-2 with respect to SARS-CoV-1. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 Orf3a channel forming residues enhances the formation of a prominent the inter-subunit channel, which was not present in the SARS-CoV-1 Orf3a. This enhanced structural feature can be correlated with higher channelling activity in SARS-CoV-2 than in SARS-CoV-1. On the other hand, E protein is one of the most conserved protein among the SARS-CoV proteome. We found that the water molecules form networks of electrostatic interactions with the polar residues in the E protein putative wetted condition while no water channel formation was observed in the putative dewetted condition. This aqueous medium mediates the non-selective translocation of cations thus affecting the ionic homeostasis of the host cellular compartments. This ionic imbalance leads to increased inflammatory response in the host cell. Our results shed light into the mechanism of viroporin action, which can be leveraged for the development of antiviral therapeutics. Furthermore, our results corroborate with previously published transcriptomic data from COVID-19 infected lung alveolar cells where inflammatory responses and molecular regulators directly impacted by ion channelling were upregulated.

DDE transposons have also made important contributions to varied host functions during eukaryotic evolution, and their transposases may be the most abundant and ubiquitous genes in nature. Yet much remains unknown about their basic biology. We employ a broadscale screen of DDE transposase diversity to characterise major evolutionary patterns for all 19 DDE transposon superfamilies. We identify considerable variation in DDE transposon superfamily size, and find a dominant association with animal hosts. While few DDE transposon superfamilies specialise in plants or fungi, the four largest superfamilies contain major plant-associated clades, at least partially underlying their relative success. We recover a pattern of host conservation among DDE transposon lineages, punctuated by occasional horizontal transfer to distantly related hosts. Host range and horizontal transfer are strongly positively correlated with DDE transposon superfamily size, arguing against variation in the capacity for generalism. We find that rates of horizontal transfer decrease sharply with increasing levels of host taxonomy, supporting the existence of host-associated barriers to DDE transposon spread. Overall, despite their relatively simple genetic structure, our results imply that trade-offs in host adaptation are important in defining DDE transposon-host relationships and evolution. In addition, our study provides a phylogenetic framework to facilitate the identification and further analysis of DDE transposons.</p>",2021-09-26

Here we examined whether chronic stroke survivors were able to use real-time fMRI neurofeedback to increase laterality of motor cortex activity and assessed effects on motor performance and on brain structure and function. We carried out a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial in which 24 chronic stroke survivors with mild to moderate upper limb impairment experienced three training days of either Real (n=12) or Sham (n=12) neurofeedback. Stroke survivors were able to use Real neurofeedback to increase laterality of motor cortex activity within, but not across, training days. Improvement in gross hand motor performance assessed by the Jebsen Taylor Test (JTT) was observed in the Real neurofeedback group compared to Sham. However, there were no improvements on the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) or the Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer (UE-FM) score. Additionally, decreased white-matter asymmetry of the corticospinal tracts was detected 1-week after neurofeedback training, indicating that the tracts become more similar with Real neurofeedback. Changes in the affected corticospinal tract was positively correlated with neurofeedback performance. Therefore, here we demonstrate that chronic stroke survivors are able to use fMRI neurofeedback to self-modulate motor cortex activity, and that training is associated with improvements in hand motor performance and with white matter structural changes.</p>",2021-09-26

Peterson'}]","<p>Although some pharmacological agents are known to alter social behaviors, precise description and quantification of such effects have proven difficult. The complexity of brain functions regulating sociality makes it challenging to predict drug effects on social behavior without testing in live animals, and most existing behavioral assays are low-throughput and provide only unidimensional readouts of social function. To achieve richer characterization of drug effects on sociality, we developed a scalable social behavioral assay for zebrafish named ZeChat based on unsupervised deep learning. High-dimensional and dynamic social behavioral phenotypes are automatically classified using this method. By screening a neuroactive compound library, we found that different classes of chemicals evoke distinct patterns of social behavioral fingerprints. By examining these patterns, we discovered that dopamine D3 agonists possess a social stimulative effect on zebrafish. The D3 agonists pramipexole, piribedil, and 7-hydroxy-DPAT-HBr rescued social deficits in a valproic acid-induced zebrafish autism model. The ZeChat platform provides a promising approach for dissecting the pharmacology of social behavior and discovering novel social-modulatory compounds.</p>",2021-09-25

To address this, we developed a deep neural network model optimized to assess decision confidence directly given high-dimensional inputs such as images. The model naturally accounts for a number of puzzling dissociations between decisions and confidence, suggests a principled explanation of these dissociations in terms of optimization for the statistics of sensory inputs, and makes the surprising prediction that, despite these dissociations, decisions and confidence depend on a common decision variable.</p>",2021-09-30

Their properties -as immunomodulatory and regenerative capacities-are in part due to the secretion of Extracellular Vesicles (EVs). Small EVs (sEVs) with sizes that range from 50 to 120 nm contain proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids that exert a role in cellular communication. Their content will depend on the cell of origin and its physiological state, thus the message they convey might change in response to changes in cellular conditions. In particular, the DNA damage response (DDR) has been reported to modulate sEVs secretion. In this work, we analyze how UV-C radiation upon iPSC-MSC alter sEVs secretion, cargo and bystander effect. Here, we confirm that UV-C radiation causes DDR in a dose dependent manner. In addition, we found that UV-C induced stress did not modulate the expression of genes that participate in sEVs biogenesis pathway. Consequently, we found that the amount of sEVs secreted by radiated and non-irradiated cells remained stable. However, sEVs from radiated cells were unable to promote cell migration in their target cells. Moreover, a label-free proteomic analysis revealed that UV-C induced DDR produces sEVs with an altered cargo, rich in migration-inhibiting proteins, and resulting in a less stromal-oriented repertoire.</p>",2021-09-28

Preservation of ovarian function requires treatment strategies that prevent loss of immature oocytes in primordial follicles during cancer therapy.

To determine which cancer treatments could benefit from ovoprotective activity of CHEK2 inhibition we investigated oocyte survival in <italic>Chek2</italic>-/- mice exposed to different chemotherapy drugs.

Using genetic knockouts we reveal a critical role for TRP53 in oocyte response to chemotherapy drugs and show that both targets of CHEK2—TAp63 and TRP53— are activated by cisplatin and cyclophosphamide. Furthermore, we show that checkpoint kinase inhibitor and radiation- and chemotherapy sensitizer AZD7762 reduces oocyte elimination after radiation and chemotherapy treatments, despite its cytotoxic effect on ovarian somatic cells.

Checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) inhibition is an attractive strategy for protecting ovarian reserve with a potential additional benefit of sensitizing cancer cells to radiation and chemotherapy. Using a genetic approach, we show that blocking CHEK2 function is sufficient to prevent elimination of primordial oocytes damaged by chemotherapy drugs such as cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, mafosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide.

Because skeletal tissues are notoriously challenging to study using functional genomic approaches, they remain poorly characterized even in humans, let alone across multiple species. The challenges involved in obtaining functional genomic data from the skeleton, combined with the difficulty of obtaining such tissues from nonhuman apes, motivated us to consider an alternative <italic>in vitro</italic> system with which to comparatively study gene regulation in skeletal cell types. Specifically, we differentiated six human and six chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cell lines (<bold>iPSCs</bold>) into mesenchymal stem cells (<bold>MSCs</bold>) and subsequently into osteogenic cells (bone cells). We validated differentiation using standard methods and collected single-cell RNA sequencing data from over 100,000 cells across multiple samples and replicates at each stage of differentiation. While most genes that we examined display conserved patterns of expression across species, hundreds of genes are differentially expressed (<bold>DE</bold>) between humans and chimpanzees within and across stages of osteogenic differentiation. Some of these interspecific DE genes show functional enrichments relevant in skeletal tissue trait development. Moreover, topic modeling indicates that interspecific gene programs become more pronounced as cells mature. Overall, we propose that this <italic>in vitro</italic> model can be used to identify interspecific regulatory differences that may have contributed to skeletal trait differences between species.</p><sec><title>Author Summary</title><p>Primates display a range of skeletal morphologies and susceptibilities to skeletal diseases, but the molecular basis of these phenotypic differences is unclear. Studies of gene expression variation in primate skeletal tissues are extremely restricted due to the ethical and practical challenges associated with collecting samples. Nevertheless, the ability to study gene regulation in primate skeletal tissues is crucial for understanding how the primate skeleton has evolved. We therefore developed a comparative primate skeletal cell culture model that allows us to access a spectrum of human and chimpanzee cell types as they differentiate from stem cells into bone cells. While most gene expression patterns are conserved across species, we also identified hundreds of differentially expressed genes between humans and chimpanzees within and across stages of differentiation. We also classified cells by osteogenic stage and identified additional interspecific differentially expressed genes which may contribute to skeletal trait differences. We anticipate that this model will be extremely useful for exploring questions related to gene regulation variation in primate bone biology and development.</p></sec>",2021-10-01

This optical context aims to put honeybees in the same flight conditions as an open sky flight above mirror-smooth water. An optical manipulation, based on a pair of opposed horizontal mirrors, was designed to remove any visual information coming from the floor and ceiling.

Mice lacking the Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) recapitulate many symptoms of RTT, and recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-1 (rhIGF-1) restores KCC2 expression and E/I balance in MeCP2 KO mice. However, clinical trial outcomes of rhIGF-1 in RTT have been variable, and increasing its therapeutic efficacy is highly desirable. To this end, the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) is promising, as it also critically modulates KCC2 function during early postnatal development. We measured basal KCC2 expression levels in MeCP2 KO mice and identified three key frontal brain regions showing KCC2 alterations in young adult mice but not in postnatal P10 animals. We thus hypothesized that deficits in an IGF-1/OXT signaling crosstalk modulating KCC2 may occur in RTT during postnatal development. Consistently, we detected alterations of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and OXT receptor (OXTR) levels in those brain areas. rhIGF-1 and OXT treatments in KO mice rescued KCC2 expression in a region-specific and complementary manner.

On Earth, muscle unloading leads to a disproportionate loss in muscle force and size with the loss in muscle force occurring at a faster rate. Though the exact mechanisms are unknown, a role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulation has been suggested. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA) pump actively brings cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the SR, eliciting muscle relaxation and maintaining low intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>). SERCA dysfunction contributes to elevations in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, leading to cellular damage and thus may contribute to the muscle weakness and atrophy observed with spaceflight. Here, we investigated SERCA function, SERCA regulatory protein content (sarcolipin, phospholamban, and neuronatin), and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) protein adduction in murine skeletal muscle after 35-37 days of spaceflight. In male and female soleus muscles, spaceflight led to drastic impairments in Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake despite significant increases in SERCA1a protein content. We attribute this impairment to an increase in RONS production and elevated total protein tyrosine (T) nitration and cysteine (S) nitrosylation. Contrarily, in the tibialis anterior (TA) we observed an enhancement in Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, which we attribute to a shift towards a faster muscle fiber type (i.e., increased myosin heavy chain IIb and SERCA1a) without elevated total protein T-nitration and S-nitrosylation.

The aim was to engineer a single-chain fusion protein that comprises sufficient mass and rigidity to allow single-particle cryo-EM data collection, without depending on binding proteins, such as G-proteins or nanobodies. Through parsing of the protein data bank (PDB), we identified the protein AmpC β-lactamase as a suitable candidate. Both termini of this protein are α-helical and the helices are antiparallel to each other. The distance between their centroids measures ∼11 Å. Such a geometry is ideal to design extended chimeric helices with transmembrane (TM) helices 5 and 6 of β1AR, and the insertion of the protein adds ∼39 kDa of mass to the receptor.

Virion structure is of interest, not only in the context of virus assembly, but also because pleomorphic variations may correlate with infectivity and pathogenicity. Detailed images of virus morphology often rely on electron microscopy, which is generally low throughput and limited in molecular identification. We have used fluorescence super-resolution microscopy combined with a rapid automated analysis pipeline to image many thousands of individual influenza virions, gaining information on their size, morphology and the distribution of membrane-embedded and internal proteins. This large-scale analysis revealed that influenza particles can be reliably characterised by length, that no spatial frequency patterning of the surface glycoproteins occurs, and that RNPs are preferentially located towards filament ends within Archetti bodies. Our analysis pipeline is versatile and can be adapted for use on multiple other pathogens, as demonstrated by its application for the size analysis of SARS-CoV-2. The ability to gain nanoscale structural information from many thousands of viruses in just a single experiment is valuable for the study of virus assembly mechanisms, host cell interactions and viral immunology, and should be able to contribute to the development of viral vaccines, anti-viral strategies and diagnostics.</p>",2021-09-24

These sex differences were well-modeled in murine transformed astrocytes, in which male cells imported and metabolized more glutamine and were more sensitive to glutaminase 1 (GLS1) inhibition. The sensitivity to GLS1 inhibition in males was driven by their dependence on glutamine-derived glutamate for α-ketoglutarate synthesis and TCA cycle replenishment.

Such an endeavor requires the integration of tens of thousands of molecular features across multiple layers of information encoded in the cells. In practical terms, this implies integration of multi omics information from the genome, transcriptome, epigenome, proteome, metabolome, and even micro-environmental factors such as the microbiome.

Genomic prediction addresses this by enabling the inclusion of all genetic data in a mixed model framework. The main method for predicting breeding values is genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), which uses the realized genomic relationship or kinship matrix (<bold>K</bold>) to connect genotype to phenotype. The use of relationship matrices allows information to be shared for estimating the genetic values for observed entries and predicting genetic values for unobserved entries. One of the key parameters of such models is genomic heritability <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""460999v1_inline1.gif"" /></alternatives></inline-formula>, or the variance of a trait associated with a genome-wide sample of DNA polymorphisms. Here we discuss the relationship between several common methods for calculating the genomic relationship matrix and propose a new matrix based on the average semivariance that yields accurate estimates of genomic variance in the observed population regardless of the focal population quality as well as accurate breeding value predictions in unobserved samples. Notably, our proposed method is highly similar to the approach presented by Legarra (2016) despite different mathematical derivations and statistical perspectives and only deviates from the classic approach presented in VanRaden (2008) by a scaling factor.

This hypothesis has been tested at both high and low temperatures but the results often conflict. If basal tolerance constrains plasticity (e.g. through shared mechanisms that create physiological constraints), it should be evident at the level of the individual, provided the trait measured is repeatable. Here, we used chill-coma onset temperature and chill-coma recovery time (CCO and CCRT; non-lethal thermal limits) to quantify cold tolerance of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> across two trials (pre- and post-acclimation). Cold acclimation improved cold tolerance, as expected, but individual measurements of CCO and CCRT in non-acclimated flies were not (or only slightly) repeatable. Surprisingly, however, there was still a strong correlation between basal tolerance and plasticity in cold-acclimated flies. We argue that this relationship is a statistical artefact (specifically, a manifestation of regression to the mean; RTM) and does not reflect a true trade-off or physiological constraint. Thermal tolerance trade-off patterns in previous studies that used similar methodology are thus likely to be impacted by RTM. Moving forward, controlling and/or correcting for RTM effects is critical to determining whether such a trade-off or physiological constraint truly exists.</p>",2021-09-25

Tests for diploids are well studied and widely available, but extending these approaches to autopolyploids is hampered by the presence of double reduction, the co-migration of sister chromatid segments into the same gamete during meiosis. Though a hindrance for equilibrium tests, double reduction rates are quantities of interest in their own right, as they provide insights about the meiotic behavior of autopolyploid organisms. Here, we develop procedures to (i) test for equilibrium while accounting for double reduction, and (ii) estimate double reduction given equilibrium. To do so, we take two approaches: a likelihood approach, and a novel <italic>U</italic>-statistic minimization approach that we show generalizes the classical equilibrium <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> test in diploids.

However, many of these systems combine multiple synthesis steps into one pot where there can be competing reactions and side products that ultimately lead to low yield of the desired product. In this work, we describe a microfluidic platform that integrates cell-free protein synthesis, glycosylation, and purification of a model glycoprotein in separate compartments where each step can be individually optimized. Microfluidics offer advantages such as reaction compartmentalization, tunable residence time, the ability to tether enzymes for reuse, and the potential for continuous manufacturing. Moreover, it affords an opportunity for spatiotemporal control of glycosylation reactions that is difficult to achieve with existing cell-based and cell-free glycosylation systems. In this work, we demonstrate a flow-based glycoprotein synthesis system that promotes enhanced cell-free protein synthesis, efficient protein glycosylation with an immobilized oligosaccharyltransferase, and enrichment of the protein product from cell-free lysate. Overall, this work represents a first-in-kind glycosylation-on-a-chip prototype that could find use as a laboratory tool for mechanistic dissection of the protein glycosylation process as well as a biomanufacturing platform for small batch, decentralized glycoprotein production.</p>",2021-09-24

Presence–absence variants (PAVs) are extreme cases of such alleles, where a gene present in one haplotype does not exist in another. Since PAVs may result from either birth or death of a gene, PAV genes and their alternative alleles, if available, can represent a basis for rapid intraspecific gene evolution. Here, we traced a possible evolution of PAV genes in the PD1074 and CB4856 <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains as well as their alternative alleles found in other 14 wild strains, using long-read sequencing technologies.

Dysfunction of human ABCD1 usually causes the severe progressive genetic disorder X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, which eventually affects the adrenal glands and/or the central nervous system. Here, we report three cryo-EM structures of human ABCD1 in various states. The apo-form ABCD1 at 3.53 Å resolution adopts an inward-facing conformation, harboring a phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) molecule at each lateral entry of substrate cavity. In the substrate-bound ABCD1 structure at 3.59 Å resolution, two molecules of C22:0-CoA (one of the physiological substrates of ABCD1) is symmetrically bound to the transmembrane domains (TMDs). Each C22:0-CoA adopts an unpresented L-shape configuration: the CoA portion inserts into a polar pocket at the TMD at a pose parallel to the membrane plane, whereas the acyl chain portion perpendicular to membrane plane is embedded in a hydrophobic pocket at the opposite TMD. Upon binding the two C22:0-CoA molecules, which resemble a pair of hinges crossing the two TMDs, the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of ABCD1 approach towards each other. Addition ATP to the substrate-bound ABCD1 enabled us to reveal an ATP-bound structure at 2.79 Å, which shows an outward-facing conformation with the dimerized NBDs succeeding substrate release. These three structures combined with biochemical assays exhibit a snapshot of ABCD1-mediated substrate recognition, translocation and release.

Furthermore, sequencing of centromeric regions requires high coverage to fully analyze length and sequence variations, which can be extremely costly. To bypass these issues, we have developed a technique based on selective restriction digestion and size fractionation to enrich for centromeric DNA from human cells. Combining enzymes capable of cutting at high frequency throughout the genome, except within most human centromeres, with size-selection of &gt;20 kb fragments resulted in over 25-fold enrichment in centromeric DNA.

We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to ablate galectin-3 in stromal cells and found that galectin-3 is dispensable for steady-state BCP-ALL proliferation and viability. However, efficient leukemia migration and adhesion to stromal cells are significantly dependent on stromal galectin-3. Importantly, loss of stromal galectin-3 production sensitized BCP-ALL cells to conventional chemotherapy. We therefore tested novel carbohydrate-based small molecule compounds (Cpd14 and Cpd17) with high specificity for galectin-3. Consistent with results obtained using galectin-3-knockout stromal cells, treatment of stromal-BCP-ALL co-cultures inhibited BCP-ALL migration and adhesion. Moreover, these compounds induced anti-leukemic responses in BCP-ALL cells including a dose-dependent reduction of viability and proliferation, induction of apoptosis and, importantly, inhibition of drug resistance. Collectively, these findings indicate galectin-3 regulates BCP-ALL cell responses to chemotherapy through the interactions between leukemia cells and the stroma, and show that a combination of galectin-3 inhibition with conventional drugs can sensitize the leukemia cells to chemotherapy.</p>",2021-09-24

Antibody titers of NP-IgG, RBD-IgG, and nAbs were higher in severe and moderate cases than in mild cases at 12 months after onset. While the nAb levels were likely to confer adequate protection against wild-type viral infection, the neutralization activity to recently circulating variants in some of the mild cases (∼30%) was undermined, implying the susceptibility of reinfection to the variants of concerns (VOCs). COVID-19 convalescent individuals have robust humoral immunity even at 12 months after infection albeit that the medical history and background of patients could affect the function and dynamics of antibody response to the VOCs.</p>",2021-09-29

An unintended “side-effect” of face masks is their adverse influence on speech perception especially in challenging listening situations. So far, behavioural studies have not pinpointed exactly which feature(s) of speech processing face masks affect in such listening situations. We conducted an audiovisual (AV) multi-speaker experiment using naturalistic speech (i.e. an audiobook). In half of the trials, the target speaker wore a (surgical) face mask, while we measured the brain activity of normal hearing participants via magnetoencephalography (MEG). A decoding model on the clear AV speech (i.e. no additional speaker and target speaker not wearing a face mask) was trained and used to reconstruct crucial speech features in each condition. We found significant main effects of face masks on the reconstruction of acoustic features, such as the speech envelope and spectral speech features (i.e. pitch and formant frequencies), while reconstruction of higher level features of speech segmentation (phoneme and word onsets) were especially impaired through masks in difficult listening situations, i.e. when a distracting speaker was also presented. Our findings demonstrate the detrimental impact face masks have on listening and speech perception, thus extending previous behavioural results. Supporting the idea of visual facilitation of speech is the fact that we used surgical face masks in our study, which only show mild effects on speech acoustics. This idea is in line with recent research, also by our group, showing that visual cortical regions track spectral modulations. Since hearing impairment usually affects higher frequencies, the detrimental effect of face masks might pose a particular challenge for individuals who likely need the visual information about higher frequencies (e.g. formants) to compensate.</p>",2021-09-30

Several studies have examined this dependency using fMRI, reporting preferred spatial frequencies (tuning curve peaks) of V1 voxels as a function of eccentricity, but their results differ by as much as two octaves, presumably due to differences in stimuli, measurements, and analysis methodology. Here, we characterize spatial frequency tuning at a millimeter resolution within human primary visual cortex, across stimulus orientation and visual field locations. We measured fMRI responses to a novel set of stimuli, constructed as sinusoidal gratings in log-polar coordinates, which include circular, radial, and spiral geometries. For each individual stimulus, the local spatial frequency varies inversely with eccentricity, and for any given location in the visual field, the full set of stimuli span a broad range of spatial frequencies and orientations. Over the measured range of eccentricities, the preferred spatial frequency is well-fit by a function that varies as the inverse of the eccentricity plus a small constant. We also find small but systematic effects of local stimulus orientation, defined in both absolute coordinates and relative to visual field location.

NOTCH1 is a mechanosensitive receptor, where mechanical force is required to activate the proteolytic cleavage and release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). Here, we circumvent this step by regulating Notch activity by light. To achieve this, we have engineered a membrane-bound optogenetic NOTCH1 receptor (optoNotch) to control the activation of NOTCH1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) and its downstream transcriptional activities. Using optoNotch we confirm that NOTCH1 activation increases cell proliferation in MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in 2D and spheroid 3D cultures.

Here we introduce a model of thymine dimers in the oxDNA forcefield, and validate it by comparison to melting experiments and structural measurements of the thymine dimer induced bend angle. We performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations of double-stranded DNA as a function of external twist and force. Compared to undamaged DNA, the presence of a thymine dimer lowers the supercoiling densities at which plectonemes and bubbles occur. For biologically relevant supercoiling densities and forces, thymine dimers can preferentially segregate to the tips of the plectonemes, where they enhance the probability of a localized tip-bubble. This mechanism increases the probability of highly bent and denatured states at the thymine dimer site, which may facilitate repair enzyme binding. Thymine dimer-induced tip-bubbles also pin plectonemes, which may help repair enzymes to locate damage.

Accumulation of protein aggregates has been shown to impede quiescent NSCs activation and the subsequent neurogenesis.

Quantifying population contact rates is important for understanding the impact of physical distancing policies and for modeling COVID-19, but contact patterns have changed substantially over time due to shifting policies and behaviors. There are surprisingly few empirical estimates of age-structured contact rates in the United States both before and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic that capture these changes. Here, we use data from six waves of the Berkeley Interpersonal Contact Survey (BICS), which collected detailed contact data between March 22, 2020 and February 15, 2021 across six metropolitan designated market areas (DMA) in the United States. Contact rates were low across all six DMAs at the start of the pandemic. We find steady increases in the mean and median number of contacts across these localities over time, as well as a greater proportion of respondents reporting a high number of contacts. We also find that young adults between ages 18 and 34 reported more contacts on average compared to other age groups. The 65 and older age group consistently reported low levels of contact throughout the study period. To understand the impact of these changing contact patterns, we simulate COVID-19 dynamics in each DMA using an age-structured mechanistic model. We compare results from models that use BICS contact rate estimates versus commonly used alternative contact rate sources. We find that simulations parameterized with BICS estimates give insight into time-varying changes in relative incidence by age group that are not captured in the absence of these frequently updated estimates. We also find that simulation results based on BICS estimates closely match observed data on the age distribution of cases, and changes in these distributions over time. Together these findings highlight the role of different age groups in driving and sustaining SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the U.S. We also show the utility of repeated contact surveys in revealing heterogeneities in the epidemiology of COVID-19 across localities in the United States.</p>",2021-09-27

The physiological mechanisms that regulate such cooperative helping behavior are poorly understood, but may have been co-opted, during the evolution of cooperative breeding, from pre-existing mechanisms that regulated parental care. Key among these may be a role for prolactin. Here we investigate whether natural variation in circulating prolactin levels predicts both parental and helper contributions to nestling provisioning in cooperatively breeding white-browed sparrow weavers, <italic>Plocepasser mahali</italic>. In sparrow weaver groups, a single dominant pair monopolize reproduction and non-breeding subordinates help with nestling feeding. We show that: (i) among parents, dominant females feed nestlings at higher rates, make longer provisioning visits and have higher prolactin levels than dominant males; and (ii) among subordinates, engaged in cooperative helping behavior, those within their natal groups feed nestlings at higher rates and have higher prolactin levels than immigrants. Moreover, continuous variation in prolactin levels positively predicts nestling-provisioning rates and mean provisioning visit durations when all bird classes are combined. These relationships are principally driven by differences among bird classes in both circulating prolactin levels and provisioning traits; the more limited within-class variation in prolactin and provisioning traits were not evidently correlated, highlighting a likely role for additional mechanisms in the fine-scale regulation of care. Our findings broadly support the hypothesis that parental care and cooperative helping behavior are regulated by a common underlying mechanism and highlight the need for experimentation to now establish the causality of any role for prolactin.</p>",2021-09-24

However, the relationship between urethane anesthesia and physiological sleep is still unclear. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography were recorded in chronically prepared rats during natural sleep-wake states and during urethane anesthesia. We subsequently analyzed the EEG signatures associated with the loss of consciousness and found that, in comparison to natural sleep-wake states, the power, coherence, directed connectivity and complexity of brain oscillations are distinct during urethane.

These reactions would likely have been self-sustaining and self-reproductive before the advent of complex biochemical pathways found in modern organisms to synthesize lipid membranes, enzymes, or nucleic acids. Without lipid membranes and enzymes, exceedingly low concentrations of the organic intermediates of early metabolic cycles in protocells would have significantly hindered evolvability. To address this problem, we propose a mechanism, where a positive membrane potential elevates the concentration of the organic intermediates. In this mechanism, positively charged surfaces of protocell membranes due to accumulation of transition metals generate positive membrane potentials. We compute steady-state ion distributions and determine their stability in a protocell model to identify the key factors constraining achievable membrane potentials. We find that (i) violation of electroneutrality is necessary to induce nonzero membrane potentials; (ii) strategies that generate larger membrane potentials can destabilize ion distributions; and (iii) violation of electroneutrality enhances osmotic pressure and diminishes reaction efficiency, thereby driving the evolution of lipid membranes, specialized ion channels, and active transport systems.</p><sec><title>Significance</title><p>The building blocks of life are constantly synthesized and broken down through concurrent cycles of chemical transformations.

Notably, maintaining the concentration of organic intermediates at high levels needed to support their continued operation and subsequent evolution would have been particularly challenging in primitive cells lacking evolutionarily tuned lipid membranes and enzymes.

Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) aim to formalize this as temporal sequences of events, in which event relationships should be supported by causal evidence according to the tailored Bradford-Hill criteria. One of the criteria is whether events are consistently observed in a certain temporal order and, in this work, we study this time concordance between gene expression- and histopathology-derived events as data-driven means to generate hypotheses on potentially causal mechanisms. As a case study, we analysed liver data from repeat-dose studies in rats from the TG-GATEs database which comprises measurements across eight timepoints, ranging from 3 hours to 4 weeks post-treatment. We identified time concordant pathway- and transcription factor (TF)-level events preceding adverse histopathology, which serves as surrogate readout for Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI). Among known events in DILI, we found some to change strongly before adverse histopathology, e.g. fatty acid beta oxidation, while others were more confident, e.g. bile acid recycling, or frequent, e.g. ATF4-mediated stress response, further characterizing their mechanistic roles. Moreover, we used the temporal order of TF expression and regulon activity to separate induced TFs, such as Cebpa, from post-transcriptionally activated ones, e.g. Srebf2, and subsequently combined this with known functional interactions (TF-target or protein-protein) to derive detailed gene-regulatory mechanisms, such as Hnf4a-dependent Cebpa expression. We additionally evaluate which time concordant events show sustained or increasing activation over time, as this time dependence is favourable for biomarker development, and identify pathways indicating dyslipidaemia, and a decrease in Hnf1a and Hnf4a indicating deteriorating liver function. At the same, time also potentially novel events are identified such as Sox13 which shows a more significant time dependence and -concordance than many known TFs in liver injury. Overall, we demonstrate how time-resolved transcriptomics can derive and support mechanistic hypotheses by quantifying time concordance and how this can be combined with prior causal knowledge, with the aim of both understanding mechanisms of toxicity, as well as potential applications to the AOP framework.

The conserved temporal order of events, their time concordance, is thereby one potential source of evidence and consequentially time-series data is particularly suited to study causal mechanisms. In this study, we present an automatable framework to quantify and characterize time concordance across a large set of time-series, and we apply this concept to gene-expression- and histopathology-derived events derived from the TG-GATEs <italic>in vivo</italic> liver data as a case study. We were able to recover known events involved in the pathogenesis of Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI), and identify potentially novel pathway and transcription factors (TFs) which precede adverse histopathology. As complementary sources of evidence for causality, we additionally show how time concordance and prior knowledge on plausible interactions between TFs can be combined to derive causal hypotheses on the TFs’ mode of regulation and interaction partners. Overall, the results derived in our case study can serve as valuable hypothesis-free starting points for the development of Adverse Outcome Pathways for DILI, and demonstrate that our approach provides a novel angle to prioritize mechanistically relevant events.</p></sec>",2021-09-24

Obtaining a better understanding of proteostasis disruption in association with different ALS-causing mutations will improve our understanding of ALS pathophysiology and may identify novel therapeutic targets and strategies for ALS patients. Here we describe the development and use of a novel high-content analysis (HCA) assay to investigate proteostasis disturbances caused by the expression of ALS-causing gene variants. This assay involves the use of conformationally-destabilised mutants of firefly luciferase (Fluc) to examine protein folding/re-folding capacity in NSC-34 cells expressing ALS-associated mutations in the genes encoding superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1<sup>A4V</sup>) and cyclin F (CCNF<sup>S621G</sup>). We demonstrate that these Fluc isoforms can be used in high-throughput format to report on reductions in the activity of the chaperone network that result from the expression of SOD1<sup>A4V</sup>, providing multiplexed information at single-cell resolution. In addition to SOD1<sup>A4V</sup> and CCNF<sup>S621G</sup>, NSC-34 models of ALS-associated TDP-43, FUS, UBQLN2, OPTN, VCP and VAPB mutants were generated that could be screened using this assay in future work. For ALS-associated mutant proteins that do cause reductions in protein quality control capacity, such as SOD1<sup>A4V</sup>, this assay has potential to be applied in drug screening studies to identify candidate compounds that can ameliorate this deficiency.</p><sec><title>Graphical abstract</title><fig id=""ufig1"" position=""float"" fig-type=""figure"" orientation=""portrait""><graphic xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""461468v1_ufig1"" position=""float"" orientation=""portrait"" /></fig></sec><sec><title>Highlights</title><list list-type=""bullet""><list-item><p>Destabilised firefly luciferase (Fluc) mutants can be used in high-content analysis (HCA) assay format</p></list-item><list-item><p>Fluc HCA assay enables information-rich reporting on chaperone network activity in cell models of ALS</p></list-item><list-item><p>Expression of SOD1<sup>A4V</sup> reduces chaperone network activity in NSC-34 cells</p></list-item></list></sec>",2021-09-23

Players’ actions replace a model algorithm making management decisions about a population of wild animals, which graze on crops and can thus lower agricultural yield. A number of non-player agents (farmers) respond through modelled algorithms to the player’s management, taking actions that may affect their crop yield as well as the animal population. Players are asked to set their own management goal (e.g. maintain the animal population at a certain level or improve yield) and make decisions accordingly. Trial players were also asked to provide any feedback on both gameplay and purpose.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We demonstrate the utility of this approach by collecting and analysing game play data from a sample of trial plays, in which we systematically vary two model parameters, and allowing trial players to interact with the model through the game interface. As an illustration, we show how variations in land ownership and the number of farmers in the system affects decision-making patterns as well as population trajectories (extinction probabilities).</p></list-item><list-item><p>We discuss the potential and limitations of this model-game approach in the light of trial player feedback received. In particular, we highlight how a common concern about the game framework (perceived lack of “realism” or relevance to a specific context) are actually criticisms of the underlying model, as opposed to the game itself. This further highlights both the parallels between games and models, as well as the utility of model-games to aid in communicating complex models. We conclude that videogames may be an effective tool for conservation and natural resource management, and that although they provide a promising means to collect data on human decision-making, it is vital to carefully consider both external validity and potential biases when doing so.</p></list-item></list></p>",2021-09-26

Recent data suggest that NF90 might influence the abundance of target mRNAs in the cytoplasm through miRNA- and Argonaute 2 (Ago2)-dependent activity. Here, we identified the interactome of NF90 in the cytoplasm, which revealed several components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and associated factors. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed the interaction of NF90 with the RISC-associated RNA helicase, Moloney leukemia virus 10 (MOV10), and other proteins involved in RISC-mediated silencing, including Ago2. Furthermore, NF90 association with MOV10 and Ago2 was found to be RNA-dependent. Glycerol gradient sedimentation of NF90 immune complexes indicates that these proteins occur in the same protein complex. At target RNAs predicted to bind both NF90 and MOV10 in their 3’ UTRs, NF90 association was increased upon loss of MOV10 and <italic>vice versa</italic>, suggesting that the two proteins may compete for the binding of common target mRNAs. Interestingly, loss of NF90 led to an increase in association of Ago2 as well as a decrease in the abundance of the target mRNA. Similarly, during hypoxia, the binding of Ago2 to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA increased after loss of NF90, while the level of VEGF mRNA decreased. These findings suggest a role for NF90 in the regulation of RISC-mediated silencing which stabilizes target mRNAs, such as VEGF, during cancer-induced hypoxia.</p>",2021-09-23

However, it is not well known how CBM recognize, bind, and dissociate from polysaccharide surfaces to facilitate efficient cellulolytic activity due to the lack of mechanistic understanding of CBM-substrate interactions.

To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the structural properties of in vitro generated fibrils from exon1 of the huntingtin protein by electron cryo-microscopy and single-particle analysis. We show that wildtype and mutant exon1 of the huntingtin protein form non-helical fibrils with a polygultamine amyloid core composed of β-hairpins with unique characteristics that have not been previously observed with other amyloid filaments. The stacks of β-hairpins form long planar β- sheets (protofilaments) with variable stacking angle and occasional out-of-register state of individual β-hairpins. These features and the propensity of protofilament to undergo lateral association results in a high degree of fibril polymorphism, including fibrils composed of varying numbers of protofilaments. Our results also represent the first direct observation of how the flanking domains are organized around the polyglutamine core of the fibril and provide insight into how they might affect huntingtin fibril structure, polymorphism, and stacking of β-hairpins within its core structure. Removal of the first 17 amino acids at the N-terminus resulted in surprising intra-fibril structural heterogeneity and reduced fibril’s propensity to lateral associations.

This approach has described the dynamics of two alternative forced choice (2AFC) decisions in terms of the path of a single quantum particle evolving in a single potential well. Here, we present a variant on that approach, which we name the Multi-Particle and Multi-Well (MPMW) quantum cognitive framework, in which decisions among N alternatives are treated by the sum of positional measurements of many independent quantum particles representing stimulus information, acted on by an N-well landscape that defines the decision alternatives. In this article, we apply the MPMW model to the simplest and most common case of N-alternative decision making, 2AFC dynamics. This application calls for a multi-particle double-well implementation, which allows us to construct a simple, analytically tractable discrete drift diffusion model (DDM), in the form of a Markov chain, wherein the parameters of the attractor wells reflect bottom-up (automatic) and top-down (control-dependent) influences on the integration of external information. We first analyze this Markov chain in its simplest form, as a single integrator with a generative process arising from a static quantum landscape and fixed thresholds, and then consider the case of multi-integrator processing under the same conditions. Within this system, stochasticity arises directly from the double-well quantum attractor landscape as a function of the dimensions of its wells, rather than as an external parameter requiring independent fitting. The simplicity of the Markov chain component of this model allows for easy analytical computation of closed forms for response time distributions and response probabilities that match qualitative properties of the accuracies and reaction times of humans performing 2AFC tasks. The MPMW framework produces response time distributions following inverse gaussian curves familiar from previous DDM models and empirical data, including the common observation that mean response times are faster for incorrect than for correct responses. The work presented in this paper serves as a proof of concept, based on which the MPMW framework can be extended to address more complex decision-making processes, (e.g., N-alternative forced choice, dynamic control allocation, and nesting quantum landscapes to allow for modeling at both the task and stimulus levels of processing) that we discuss as future directions.</p>",2021-09-24

TE abundance drives differences in genome size, but TE silencing variation across genomes of different sizes remains largely unexplored. Salamanders include most of the largest C-values — 9 to 120 Gb. We measured CpG methylation levels in salamanders with genomes ranging from 2N = ~58 Gb to 4N = ~116 Gb. We compared these levels to results from endo- and ectothermic vertebrates with more typical genomes. Salamander methylation levels are ~90%, higher than all endotherms. However, salamander methylation does not differ from the other ectotherms, despite a ~100-fold difference in nuclear DNA content. Because methylation affects the nucleotide compositional landscape through 5-methylcytosine deamination to thymine, we quantified salamander CpG dinucleotide levels and compared them to other vertebrates. Salamanders have comparable CpG levels to other ectotherms, and ectotherm levels are higher than endotherms. These data show no shift in global methylation at the base of salamanders, despite a dramatic increase in TE load and genome size.

Clinically, this heterogeneity manifests itself in health status and mortality, and it distinguishes healthy from unhealthy aging. Clinical frailty indexes (FIs) serve as an important tool in gerontology to capture health status. FIs have been adapted for use in mice and are an effective predictor of mortality risk. To accelerate our understanding of biological aging, high-throughput approaches to pre-clinical studies are necessary. Currently, however, mouse frailty indexing is manual and relies on trained scorers, which imposes limits on scalability and reliability. Here, we introduce a machine learning based visual frailty index (vFI) for mice that operates on video data from an open field assay. We generate a large mouse FI datasets comprising 256 males and 195 females. From video data on these same mice, we use neural networks to extract morphometric, gait, and other behavioral features that correlate with manual FI score and age. We use these features to train a regression model that accurately predicts frailty within 1.03 ± 0.08 (3.9% ± 0.3%) of the pre-normalized FI score in terms of median absolute error. We show that features of biological aging are encoded in open-field video data and can be used to construct a vFI that can complement or replace current manual FI methods. We use the vFI data to examine sex-specific aspects of aging in mice.

Here, we aim to study neural processes in real-world environments, while also maintaining a degree of control over perception. To achieve this, we combined mobile EEG (mEEG) and augmented reality (AR), which allows us to place virtual objects into the real world. We validated this AR and mEEG approach using a well-characterised cognitive response - the face inversion effect. Participants viewed upright and inverted faces in three EEG tasks (1) a lab-based computer task, (2) walking through an indoor environment while seeing face photographs, and (3) walking through an indoor environment while seeing virtual faces. We find greater low frequency EEG activity for inverted compared to upright faces in all experimental tasks, demonstrating that cognitively relevant signals can be extracted from mEEG and AR paradigms. This was established in both an epoch-based analysis aligned to face events, and a GLM-based approach that incorporates continuous EEG signals and face perception states. Together, this research helps pave the way to exploring neurocognitive processes in real-world environments while maintaining experimental control using AR.</p>",2021-10-01

A likely systemic target of PAE is the stress peptide corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), as activation of CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) in the medial nucleus of the central amygdala (CeM) is known to increase anxiety-like behavior in adults. To determine if CRF-CRFR1 interactions underly PAE-induced anxiety, functional changes in CRF system activity were investigated in adolescent male and female Sprague Dawley rats following G12 PAE. Compared to air-exposed controls, PAE increased basal spontaneous (s) inhibitory post-synaptic current (IPSC) frequency in the CeM of males, but not females. Furthermore, PAE blunted CRFR1-regulated miniature (m) IPSCs in a sex- and dose-specific manner, and only PAE males demonstrated tonic CRFR1 activity in the CeM. It was further determined that G12 PAE decreased CRFR1 mRNA in the CeM of males while increasing regional expression in females. Finally, infusion of a CRFR1 agonist into the CeM of adolescents produced a blunted expression of CRFR1-induced anxiety-like behavior exclusively in PAE males, mirroring the blunted physiology demonstrated by PAE males. Cumulatively, these data suggest that CRFR1 function within the CeM is age- and sex-specific, and PAE not only increases the expression of anxiety-like behavior, but may reduce the efficacy of treatment for PAE-induced anxiety through CRFR1-associated mechanisms. Therefore, future research will be necessary to develop targeted treatment of anxiety disorders in individuals with a history of PAE.</p>",2021-10-01

Using antisense RNA against trigger molecules (anti-trigger RNA), gene expression can also be switched off again. We here study the utility and regulatory effect of antisense transcription in this context, which enables a particularly compact circuit design. Our circuits utilize two inducible promoters that separately regulate trigger and anti-trigger transcription, whereas their cognate toehold switch, regulating expression of a reporter protein, is transcribed from a constitutive promoter. We explore various design options for the arrangement of the promoters and demonstrate that the resulting dynamic behavior is strongly influenced by transcriptional interference (TI) effects, leading to more than four-fold differences in expression levels. Our experimental results are consistent with previous findings that enhanced local RNA polymerase concentrations due to active promoters in close proximity lead to an increase in transcriptional activity of the strongest promoter in the circuits.

Distinct MN populations and their diversity has long been hypothesized to co-evolve with motor circuit to provide the neural basis from undulatory to ambulatory locomotion during aquatic-to-terrestrial transition of vertebrates. However, how these subtypes are evolved remains largely enigmatic. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we investigate heterogeneity in mouse MNs and discover novel segment-specific subtypes. Among limb-innervating MNs, we reveal a diverse neuropeptide code for delineating putative motor pool identities. We further uncovered that axial MNs are subdivided by three conserved and molecularly distinct subpopulations, defined by Satb2, Nr2f2 or Bcl11b expression. Although axial MNs are conserved from cephalochordates to humans, subtype diversity becomes prominent in land animals and appears to continue evolving in humans. Overall, our study provides a unified classification system for spinal MNs and paves the way towards deciphering how neuronal subtypes are evolved.</p>",2021-09-30

Cancer vaccines composed of neoantigens, or peptides unique to tumor cells due to somatic mutations, have emerged as a promising approach to activate or strengthen the immune response against cancer.

Computational prediction relies on large amounts of high-quality training data, such as mass spectrometry data of peptides presented by one of several HLAs in living cells.

In this study, we examined if cortical structural covariance at birth, indexing coordinated development, is related to later infant behaviour. We included 193 healthy term-born infants from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). An individual cortical connectivity matrix derived from morphological and microstructural features was computed for each subject (morphometric similarity networks, MSNs) and was used as input for prediction of behavioural scores at 18 months using Connectome-Based Predictive Modeling (CPM). Neonatal MSNs successfully predicted language and social-emotional performance. Predictive edges were distributed between and within known functional cortical divisions with a specific important role for primary and posterior cortical regions.

Herein, a cell-adaptable neurogenic (CaNeu) hydrogel was developed as a delivery vehicle for ADSCs to promote neuronal regeneration after SCI. The dynamic network of CaNeu hydrogel loaded with ADSCs provides a cell-infiltratable matrix that enhances axonal growth and eventually leads to improved motor evoked potential, hindlimb strength, and coordination of complete spinal cord transection in rats. Furthermore, the CaNeu hydrogel also establishes an anti-inflammatory microenvironment by inducing a shift in the polarization of the recruited macrophages toward the pro-regeneration (M2) phenotype. Our study showed that the CaNeu-hydrogel‒mediated ADSCs delivery resulted in significantly suppressed neuroinflammation and apoptosis, and that this phenomenon involved the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

However, understanding if these adaptive processes are intermingled and share common genetic bases is crucial to predict a species’ evolutionary potential, for example in response to changing environmental conditions. We use whole genome data from six populations across three different habitats of the wild tomato species <italic>Solanum chilense</italic>, to 1) infer the past demographic history, and 2) search for genes under strong positive selection. We then correlate the demographic history, allele frequencies in space and time, the age of selection events and the reconstructed historical ecological distribution of the species over five main climatic periods spanning 150,000 years. We find evidence for several selective sweeps targeting regulatory networks involved in root hair development in low altitude, and response to photoperiod and vernalization in high altitude populations. These sweeps occur in a concerted fashion in a given regulatory gene network and only at particular time periods, thereby underpinning temporal local adaptation. These genes under positive selection provide subsequently the basis for spatial local adaptation to novel habitats when new ecological niches become available.

This is particularly true for hypogeous sporocarps, including truffles, which are extremely difficult to survey in a systematic manner. However, fungi with hypogeous sporocarps have evolved traits that make them highly attractive to animals, such as small mammals, which ingest and disperse fungal spores through defecation.

Here, we compare two mutations at a conserved position in the central B-chain α-helix: one neonatal in DM onset (Val<sup>B18</sup>→Gly) and the other with onset delayed until adolescence (Ala<sup>B18</sup>).

While appropriate to generate the stable, rhythmic movement patterns of steady-state walking, these models lack the ability to change their movement patterns or spontaneously generate new movements in the specific, goal-directed way characteristic of voluntary movements. Here we present a neuromuscular model of human locomotion that bridges this gap and combines the ability to execute goal directed movements with the generation of stable, rhythmic movement patterns that are required for robust locomotion. The model represents goals for voluntary movements of the swing leg on the task level of swing leg joint kinematics. Smooth movements plans towards the goal configuration are generated on the task level and transformed into descending motor commands that execute the planned movements, using internal models. The movement goals and plans are updated in real time based on sensory feedback and task constraints. On the spinal level, the descending commands during the swing phase are integrated with a generic stretch reflex for each muscle. Stance leg control solely relies on dedicated spinal reflex pathways. Spinal reflexes stimulate Hill-type muscles that actuate a biomechanical model with eight internal joints and six free-body degrees of freedom. The model is able to generate voluntary, goal-directed reaching movements with the swing leg and combine multiple movements in a rhythmic sequence. During walking, the swing leg is moved in a goal-directed manner to a target that is updated in real-time based on sensory feedback to maintain upright balance, while the stance leg is stabilized by low-level reflexes and a behavioral organization switching between swing and stance control for each leg. With this combination of reflexive stance leg and voluntary, goal-directed control of the swing leg, the model controller generates rhythmic, stable walking patterns in which the swing leg movement can be flexibly updated in real-time to step over or around obstacles.</p>",2021-09-26

We analysed how the vaccine uptake rate affects cumulative numbers of new infections three and six months after the start of vaccination.

These adverse effects can be alleviated if vaccinated individuals do not revert to pre-pandemic contact rates, and if non-vaccinated individuals remain compliant with physical distancing measures. Both require convincing, clear and appropriately targeted communication strategies by public health authorities.</p><sec><title>Significance Statement</title><p>SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns are in progress in many countries around the world. As the vaccination coverage increases, the compliance with physical distancing measures aimed at reducing virus transmission may decline. Using a socio-epidemiological model we identify factors that are the drivers of increased transmission when SARS-CoV-2 prevalence is higher than the projected prevalence without vaccination. To maximize the benefits of vaccination campaigns, compliance in vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups should be targeted prioritizing one group over the other depending on the vaccination rate, the efficacy of vaccine in blocking the infection, and the circulating variant.</p></sec>",2021-09-26

Until now, most mechanistic studies on GDF15 rely on pharmacological interventions using exogenous GDF15, but little is known about its mode of action when induced both chronically and endogenously. Mitochondrial stress is one of the most described physiological conditions that induces GDF15<sup>1</sup>, and therefore an important model to study the underlying mechanisms of endogenous GDF15’s action. Here, using a mouse model of mitochondrial dysfunction via elevated respiratory uncoupling in skeletal muscle, we show a circadian oscillation of muscle-derived GDF15 to promote a daytime-restricted anorexia without signs of nausea or reduced physical activity, contrary to findings using recombinant GDF15<sup>2–5</sup>. We find that mitochondrial stress-induced GDF15 associates with increased anxiety and hypothalamic corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) induction, without further activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and corticosterone response. Strikingly, the daytime-restricted anorexia, lean phenotype, systemic shift in substrate metabolism and anxiety-like behavior are completely abolished in conditions of mitochondrial stress coupled with genetic ablation of the GDF15 receptor GDNF receptor alpha-like (GFRAL), which is predominantly expressed in the hindbrain. Finally, we demonstrate that stress-induced GDF15-GFRAL signaling is required for hypothalamic CRH induction to control diurnal food intake in a CRH-receptor 1 (CRHR1)-dependent manner. With this, we uncover for the first time a molecular target of the GDF15-GFRAL axis that links anxiolytic and anorectic behavior as downstream effects of the chronic activation of this pathway by mitochondrial stress.</p>",2021-09-24

Here, we present a model-agnostic framework to reinforce AutoML using strategies and tools of explainable and reproducible AI, including novel metrics for performance precision and feature instability. The framework enables clinicians to interpret AutoML-generated models for clinical and biological verifiability and consequently integrate domain expertise during model development. We applied the framework towards spinal cord injury prognostication and identified a detrimental relationship between intraoperative hypertension and patient outcome. Furthermore, our analysis captured evolving clinical practices such as faster time-to-surgery and blood pressure management that affected clinical model validation.

Phytochromes are linear tetrapyrrole-binding photoreceptors present in plants, algae, fungi, and various bacteria. Most phytochromes respond to red and far-red light signals. Among the phytochrome superfamily, cyanobacteria-specific cyanobacteriochromes show much more diverse optical properties covering the entire visible region. Both phytochromes and cyanobacteriochromes share the GAF domain scaffold to cradle the chromophore as the light-sensing region. It is unknown what physiological demands drove the evolution of cyanobacteriochromes in cyanobacteria. Here we utilize ancestral sequence reconstruction and report that the resurrected ancestral cyanobacteriochrome proteins reversibly respond to green and red light signals. pH titration analyses indicate that the deprotonation of the bound phycocyanobilin chromophore enables the photoreceptor to perceive green light. The ancestral cyanobacteriochromes show modest thermal reversion to the green light-absorbing form, suggesting that they evolved to sense green-rich irradiance rather than red light, which is preferentially utilized for photosynthesis. In contrast to plants and green algae, many cyanobacteria can utilize green light for photosynthesis with their special light-harvesting complexes, phycobilisomes.

Our ancestral sequence reconstruction and the analysis of the resurrected ancestral proteins suggest that the very first cyanobacteriochrome most probably responded to the incident green-to-red light ratio, in contrast to modern red/far-red absorbing plant phytochromes.

We identified NPC1 in CRISPR and RNA interference screens as a putative host factor for infection by mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus). Following internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the reovirus outer capsid is proteolytically removed, the endosomal membrane is disrupted, and the viral core is released into the cytoplasm where viral transcription, genome replication, and assembly take place. We found that reovirus infection is significantly impaired in cells lacking NPC1, but infection is restored by treatment of cells with hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, which binds and solubilizes cholesterol. Absence of NPC1 did not dampen infection by infectious subvirion particles, which are reovirus disassembly intermediates that bypass the endocytic pathway for infection of target cells. NPC1 is not required for reovirus attachment to the plasma membrane, internalization into cells, or uncoating within endosomes. Instead, NPC1 is required for delivery of transcriptionally active reovirus core particles into the cytoplasm. These findings suggest that cholesterol homeostasis, ensured by NPC1 transport activity, is required for reovirus penetration into the cytoplasm, pointing to a new function for NPC1 and cholesterol homeostasis in viral infection.</p><sec><title>Author summary</title><p>Genetic screens are useful strategies to identify host factors required for viral infection.

Ruffolo'}, {'name': 'Sai Pooja Mahajan'}, {'name': 'Jeffrey J. Gray'}]","<p>Antibody engineering is becoming increasingly popular in medicine for the development of diagnostics and immunotherapies. Antibody function relies largely on the recognition and binding of antigenic epitopes via the loops in the complementarity determining regions. Hence, accurate high-resolution modeling of these loops is essential for effective antibody engineering and design. Deep learning methods have previously been shown to effectively predict antibody backbone structures described as a set of inter-residue distances and orientations. However, antigen binding is also dependent on the specific conformations of surface side chains. To address this shortcoming, we created DeepSCAb: a deep learning method that predicts inter-residue geometries as well as side chain dihedrals of the antibody variable fragment. The network requires only sequence as input, rendering it particularly useful for antibodies without any known backbone conformations. Rotamer predictions use an interpretable self-attention layer, which learns to identify structurally conserved anchor positions across several species. We evaluate the performance of our model for discriminating near-native structures from sets of decoys and find that DeepSCAb outperforms similar methods lacking side chain context. When compared to alternative rotamer repacking methods, which require an input backbone structure, DeepSCAb predicts side chain conformations competitively. Our findings suggest that DeepSCAb improves antibody structure prediction with accurate side chain modeling and is adaptable to applications in docking of antibody-antigen complexes and design of new therapeutic antibody sequences.</p>",2021-09-22

A subset of mammalian species expresses two protamines (PRM1 and PRM2), while in others PRM1 is sufficient for sperm chromatin packaging. Alterations of the species-specific ratio between PRM1 and PRM2 are associated with infertility. Unlike PRM1, PRM2 is generated as a precursor protein consisting of a highly conserved N-terminal domain, termed cleaved PRM2 (cP2), which is consecutively trimmed off during chromatin condensation. The carboxyterminal part, called mature PRM2 (mP2), interacts with DNA and mediates chromatin-hypercondensation, together with PRM1. The removal of the cP2 domain is believed to be imperative for proper chromatin condensation and the prevention of DNA damage. Yet, the role of cP2 is not yet understood. Using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing, we generated mice lacking the cP2 domain while the mP2 is still expressed. We show that deletion of one allele of the cP2 domain is sufficient to render male mice infertile. cP2 deficient sperm show incomplete PRM2 incorporation, retention of transition proteins and a severely altered protamine ratio. During epididymal transit, cP2 deficient sperm seem to undergo ROS mediated degradation leading to complete DNA fragmentation, inviability and immotility of mature sperm. The cP2 domain therefore seems to be necessary for the complex crosstalk leading to the successive and complete removal of transition proteins and complete protamination of sperm chromatin. Overall, we present the first step towards understanding the role of the cP2 domain in paternal chromatin packaging and open up avenues for further research.</p>",2021-10-01

In particular, there is no generation of effective HIV-specific T cell responses, which are thought to play an important role in controlling HIV in the rare individuals who can spontaneously control the virus. Inhibitory immune checkpoints (IC) such as PD-1 contribute to T cell dysfunction and failure to control viral infections, including HIV, and IC blockade (ICB) represents a potential adjuvant to ART through restoration of T cell functions. While most studies have focused on CD8+ T cells, increasing evidence shows that the remarkable impact of ICB therapy in a subset of cancer patients is enhanced by functional CD4+ T cell help, which can be directly affected by ICB. While effective virus-specific CD4+ T cell responses are also thought to be important for immune control of HIV, these cells are highly heterogenous. How IC expression and function differs across CD4+ T cell lineages and the consequences of this diversity for IC blockade (ICB) strategies are still poorly understood.</p></sec><sec><title>Added value of this study</title><p>To compare various stages of immune dysfunction, we examined people living with HIV (PLWH) with different levels of viral control pre-ART (including elite controllers who spontaneously control virus) and followed a cohort longitudinally post-ART. We used a panel of assays to characterize HIV-specific CD4+ T cell subsets, including activation-induced marker (AIM) assays and flow cytometric detection of mRNAs coding for a wider variety of HIV-specific CD4+ T cell functions than what is detected by standard procedures. Our experiments indicate a hierarchy of IC (PD-1, TIGIT, CD200) expression on blood HIV-specific CD4+ T cells that depends not only on the person’s infection status but also on expression of lineage differentiation markers and effector functions representative of CD4+ T cell subsets critical for antiviral responses (T<sub>FH</sub>, T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>17/T<sub>H</sub>22 cells). This hierarchy was also present in the putatively functional cells of elite controllers. We characterized the expression of the dysfunction-related transcription factor TOX, and saw that its association with the key IC PD-1 in the setting of viremia varied across CD4+ T cell polarizations. Response to blockade of the PD-1 pathway resulted in increased antiviral and mucosal-protective functions, but did not affect T<sub>FH</sub>-related functions. Response to ICB was most prominent in viremic patients, and subdued but not fully abrogated in the setting of viral suppression.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications of all available evidence</title><p>These results highlight a previously unrecognized impact of ICB on mucosal immunity-related CD4+ functions, which are known to be depleted upon HIV infection and not restored by ART, and strong links between IC expression patterns and HIV-specific CD4+ T cell differentiation. The impact of ICB on CD4+ T cells in HIV infection has primarily been studied in the context of viral reservoir reactivation, which are preferentially harbored in IC+ cells. Our work emphasizes the importance of considering the differentiation profile of the virus-specific CD4+ T cells in studies of ICB blockade, as it may direct ICB efficacy in HIV infection. This data may also have implications for CD4+ T cell help in other infectious and non-infectious chronic human diseases.</p></sec></sec>",2021-09-24

Understanding how gene regulatory circuits operate dynamically requires monitoring the expression of multiple genes in the same cell. However, it is limited by the relatively few distinguishable fluorescent proteins. Here, we developed a multiplexed real-time transcriptional imaging method based on two RNA stem-loop binding proteins, and employed it to analyze the temporal dynamics of synthetic gene circuits. By incorporating different ratios of MS2 and PP7 stem-loops, we were able to monitor the real-time nascent transcriptional activities of up to five genes in the same cell using only two fluorescent proteins. Applying this multiplexing capability to synthetic linear or branched gene regulatory cascades revealed that propagation of transcriptional dynamics is enhanced by non-stationary dynamics and is dictated by the slowest regulatory branch in the presence of combinatorial regulation. Mathematical modeling provided further insight into temporal multi-gene interactions and helped to understand potential challenges in regulatory inference using snapshot single-cell data. Ratiometric multiplexing should scale exponentially with additional labelling channels, providing a way to track the dynamics of larger circuits.</p>",2021-09-23

Recent genetic evidence in yeast, flies and human cells have suggested additional functions of Wee1 in mitosis and during mitotic exit, respectively. To discover new candidate substrates of Wee1 kinase, we used SILAC-based phosphoproteomics and selective chemical inhibition to quantitatively compare phosphorylation site abundances in the presence and absence of Wee1 activity. Unexpectedly, we uncovered a role for the Wee1-dependent phosphorylation of Cdk1-cyclin B at tyrosine 15 (Y15) in facilitating chemical inhibition of Cdk1-cyclin B by the inhibitor RO3306. Thermal shift stability assays demonstrated greater binding affinity of RO3306 for Y15-phosphorylated Cdk1-cyclin B versus unphosphorylated complex, providing an additional molecular basis for the observed Wee1 inhibitor-based toxicity in human cells. In addition, our experiments identified Cdk5-CABLES and Cdk5-cyclin B as novel substrates of Wee1 during chemically induced exit from mitosis.

Identifying the mechanisms synchronizing neurons in the MOB will be key to understanding how network oscillations support the coding of a high-dimensional sensory space. Here, using paired recordings and optogenetic activation of glomerular sensory inputs in MOB slices, we uncovered profound differences in principal mitral cell (MC) vs. tufted cell (TC) spike-time synchrony: TCs robustly synchronized across fast- and slow-gamma frequencies, while MC synchrony was weaker and concentrated in slow-gamma frequencies. Synchrony among both cell types was enhanced by shared glomerular input but was independent of intraglomerular lateral excitation. Cell-type differences in synchrony could also not be traced to any difference in the synchronization of synaptic inhibition. Instead, greater TC than MC synchrony paralleled the more periodic firing among resonant TCs than MCs and emerged in patterns consistent with densely synchronous network oscillations. Collectively, our results thus reveal a mechanism for parallel processing of sensory information in the MOB via differential TC vs. MC synchrony, and further contrast mechanisms driving fast network oscillations in the MOB from those driving the sparse synchronization of irregularly-firing principal cells throughout cortex.</p>",2021-09-27

This approach allows us to estimate the energy required to activate a circuit, and determine which regions most support that activation. Focusing on temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), we show that patients require more control energy to activate the limbic network than healthy volunteers, especially ipsilateral to the seizure focus. Further, greater energetic costs are largely localized to the ipsilateral temporo-limbic regions. Importantly, the energetic imbalance between ipsilateral and contralateral temporo-limbic regions is tracked by asymmetric metabolic patterns, which in turn are explained by asymmetric gray matter volume loss. In TLE, failure to meet the extra energy demands may lead to suboptimal brain dynamics and inadequate activation.

An in-depth literature search is conducted to collate available experimental data regarding optical parameters in cardiac tissue and scar. Computational simulations of photon movement through cardiac tissue using Monte Carlo modelling are performed, with analysis being focussed on the effects on surface emission profiles of (i) optical parameters; (ii) tissue thickness; (iii) presence of scar. Our results demonstrate (i) sensitivity of the approach to changes in optical parameters within tissue, (ii) difference of results depending on light wavelength. These suggest that this can be used to detect cardiac anatomical structure to a depth of ∼ 2 mm, for both thickness of cardiac tissue and presence of scar.

Conversely, in other regions of the epithelial tissue, the double-mutant cells do not strongly activate JNK, deviate from the apical side of the epithelial layer, and show benign tumor growth in the lumen. These data indicate that the onset of tumor-cell invasion is highly dependent on the tissue-intrinsic local microenvironment.

The largest peak forces were on average 175 mN and were oriented with the insect’s dorsal-ventral muscle group. Peak forces oriented with the insect’s dorsal-longitudinal muscle group averaged 117 mN. Thorax velocities were about 90 mm s^-1 p-p and velocity amplitude was positively correlated to peak force. Thorax oscillation frequency averaged 132 Hz but was highly variable both within individuals and across the tested population.

Evans'}]","<p>Tightly controlled fluctuations in kinase and phosphatase activity play important roles in regulating M-Phase transitions (e.g., G2/M). Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) is one of these phosphatases, with oscillations in activity driving mitotic M-Phase entry, progression, and exit, with evidence from a variety of experimental systems pointing to roles in meiosis as well. Here we report that PP1 is important for M-Phase transitions through mouse oocyte meiosis. Employing a unique small-molecule approach to inhibit or activate PP1 at distinct phases of mouse oocyte meiosis, we found that aberrations in normal cyclical PP1 activity leads to meiotic abnormalities. We report here that temporal control of PP1 activity is essential for G2/M transition, metaphase I/anaphase I transition, and the formation of a normal metaphase II oocyte. Our data also reveal that inappropriate activation of PP1 is more deleterious at G2/M transition than at prometaphase I-to-metaphase I, and that an active pool of PP1 during prometaphase I is vital for metaphase I/anaphase I transition and metaphase II chromosome alignment. Taken together, these results establish that loss of oscillations in PP1 activity causes a range of severe meiotic defects, pointing to essential roles for PP1 in oocytes and female fertility, and more broadly, M-Phase regulation.</p>",2021-09-28

To address some of these key issues, we have created a Dengue DNA vaccine candidate with the EDIII region as the key antigen given the promise of this segment in not causing ADE, a challenge with this disease. In addition, we have added the NS1 region to broaden the immune response.

These VOC have rapidly spread through multiple geographies being enabled by high transmission rates and/or high viral load compared to the original parent strain. Consequently, the altered phenotypes of these VOC have posed greater challenges to diagnostic and clinical management of COVID-19. Despite considerable progress being made on vaccine roll out, practicing proper hand hygiene has been advocated as a consistent precautionary intervention as more virulent VOC continue to emerge and spread across geographies.</p><p>Two variants of concern, namely beta and delta, have recently been shown to escape antibody-mediated neutralization by virtue of acquired mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein which binds to the human ACE2 receptor for cellular entry. In this report we have empirically determined the efficacy of a range of personal care formulations in inactivating the beta and delta variants of SARS-CoV-2. High titres of these variants were exposed to marketed personal care formulations from Unilever under standard in-vitro suspension test-based conditions relevant to end-user habits. All the formulations demonstrated greater than 99.9% reduction in viral infective titres. The rate of inactivation by these products were comparable to that of the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 virus tested under the same conditions. Therefore, it can be concluded that well-designed personal care formulations when tested under consumer-centric conditions, and with proven efficacy against the parent strain of SARS-CoV-2 will continue to be effective against extant and emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. This is through their broad-spectrum mode of action (disruption of lipid bilayer of the host-derived viral envelope, denaturation of envelop and nucleocapsid proteins, and disruption of genome) which is independent of the escape mutations that facilitate immune evasion or enhanced transmissibility.</p>",2021-09-23

Here we show that the light-dependent activity of SIK1 controls the phosphorylation of a subset of the brain phosphoproteome to induce sleep in a manner that is independent of sleep pressure. By uncoupling phosphorylation and sleep induction from sleep pressure, we establish that synaptic protein phosphorylation provides a causal mechanism for the induction of sleep under different environmental contexts. Furthermore, we propose a framework that details how the salt-inducible kinases regulate the synaptic phosphoproteome to integrate exogenous and endogenous stimuli, thereby providing the molecular basis upon which the sleep and circadian systems interact to control the sleep-wake cycle.</p>",2021-09-30

While the clinical presentation of AD and PD is well established, CTE can only be diagnosed post-mortem. Therefore, a distinction can be made between the pathologically defined CTE and RHI-related functional or structural brain changes (RHI-BC) which may result in CTE. Unfortunately, there are currently no accepted biomarkers of CTE nor RHI-BC, a major hurdle to achieving clinical diagnoses. Interestingly, speech has shown promise as a potential biomarker of both AD and PD, being used to accurately classify individuals with AD and PD from those without. Given the overlapping symptoms between CTE, RHI-BC, PD and AD, we aimed to determine if speech could be used to identify individuals with a history of RHI from those without. We therefore created the Verus dataset, consisting of 13 second voice recordings from 605 professional fighters (RHI group) and 605 professional athletes in non-contact sports (control group) for a total of 1210 recordings. Using a deep learning approach, we achieved 85% accuracy in detecting individuals with a history of RHI from those without. We then used our model trained on the Verus dataset to fine-tune on publicly available AD and PD speech datasets and achieved new state-of-the-art accuracies of 84.99% on the AD dataset and 89% on the PD dataset. Finding a biomarker of CTE and RHI-BC that presents early in disease progression is critical to improve risk management and patient outcome.

In addition, in the proficient animal there was a decrease in the coordinated oscillatory activity between CA1 and mPFC in the presence of the unrewarded odorant. Furthermore, the changes in PAC resulted in a marked increase in the accuracy for decoding odorant identity from tPRP when the animal became proficient. Finally, we studied the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II α (CaMKIIα), a protein involved in learning and memory, in oscillatory neural processing in this task.

Therefore, with the rapidly growing field of synthetic biology, there is an emergent demand for techniques that can continuously purify cell-like vesicles from diverse residues, while GUVs are being simultaneously synthesized and manipulated. We developed a microfluidic platform capable of purifying GUVs through stream bifurcation, where a stream of vesicles suspension is partitioned into three fractions - purified GUVs, residual components, and a washing solution.

To understand how this property emerges, we investigated the role of the inhibitory anterior paired lateral neuron (APL) in the input circuit of the MB, the calyx. Within the calyx, presynaptic boutons of projection neurons (PNs) form large synaptic microglomeruli (MGs) with dendrites of postsynaptic Kenyon cells (KCs).

To identify the transcriptional and epigenetic pathways that regulate functional capacity in HIV-specific CD8 T cells in elite controllers, we performed genome-wide transcriptional and DNA methylation analysis of MHC Class I multimer+ CD8 T cells sorted from aviremic elite controllers compared to aviremic non-controllers on suppressive ART. Co-omics analysis revealed enrichment for gene signatures that support a multipotent differentiation state, cell survival, and a long-lived effector cell fate in HIV-specific CD8 T cells from elite controllers. Specifically, we observed DNA methylation programs at the transcription factor binding sites of the stem-associated factors TCF-1 and LEF1 that delineate HIV-specific CD8 T cells from elite controllers versus ART-treated individuals. HIV-specific CD8 T cells in elite controllers also maintain T cell receptor and IL-12/STAT4 pathway signaling and have suppressed pro-apoptotic TNFα pathway signaling. These findings show that HIV-specific CD8 T cells from elite controllers have enhanced expression and DNA methylation programs that maintain developmental potential and in turn promote long-term survival, proliferative potential, and effector capacity.

Here, we characterize in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> TbKifX2, a hitherto orphaned kinesin that belongs to one of these groups.

The proximal proteome of TbPH1 is comprised of four proteins that localize to the FAZ, consistent with the notion that the TbKifX2/TbPH1 complex binds the MtQ along its whole length. Simultaneous ablation of both TbKifX2 and TbPH1 leads to the formation of prominent protrusions from the cell posterior. Thus, we have attributed a morphogenesis role to these two trypanosomatid-restricted proteins, and their remarkably specific localization to the MtQ in a microtubule-rich cell.

Since corals can thrive on mesophotic reefs under extreme light-limited conditions, we hypothesized that microskeletal coral features optimize light capture under low-light environments. Using micro-computed tomography scanning, we conducted a comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) assessment of small-scale skeleton morphology of the depth-generalist coral <italic>Stylophora pistillata</italic> collected from shallow (5 m) and mesophotic (45 m) depths. We detected a high phenotypic diversity between depths, resulting in two distinct morphotypes, with calyx diameter, theca height, and corallite marginal spacing contributing to most of the variation between depths. To determine whether such depth-specific morphotypes affect coral light capture and photosynthesis on the corallite-scale, we developed 3D simulations of light propagation based on photosynthesis-irradiance parameters. We found that corals associated with shallow morphotypes dissipated excess light through self-shading microskeletal features; while mesophotic morphotypes facilitated enhanced light absorption and photosynthesis under low-light conditions. We conclude that the mesophotic coral architecture provides a greater ability to trap solar energy and efficiently exploit the limited light conditions, and suggest that morphological modifications play a key role in the photoadaptation response to low-light.</p>",2021-10-01

Current methods to diagnose MRD and CNS infiltration rely on detecting ALL cells in patient samples using pathology, flow cytometry, or isolation of ALL genomic DNA for next-generation sequencing. However, blasts may be present in the patient but not detectable in a bone marrow biopsy or cerebrospinal (CSF) fluid sample, leading to incorrect or delayed patient diagnosis. We have developed a nanopore sequencing assay to detect B-ALL-associated cell-free DNA in patient blood and CSF samples. Quantitation of B-cell specific VDJ recombination events in cell-free DNA samples defined B-ALL clonal heterogeneity. Monitoring cfDNA in blood and CSF samples allowed us to track the response of individual B-ALL clones throughout each patient’s course of treatment. Detection of cell-free DNA predicted the clinical diagnosis of MRD and CNS disease. We also identified patients diagnosed as CNS negative who had low levels of cell-free DNA in their CSF sample. These data suggest that cell-free DNA assays may be useful in detecting the presence of ALL in the patient even when blasts are not in the biofluid sample.

Differential molecular interactions among its diverse constituents give rise to heterogeneities in the membrane lateral organization. Under certain conditions, heterogeneities in the two leaflets can be spatially synchronised and exist as registered domains across the bilayer. Several contrasting theories behind mechanisms that induce registration of nanoscale domains have been suggested[1–3]. Following a recent study[4] showing the effect of position of lipid tail unsaturation on domain registration behavior, we decided to develop an analytical theory to elucidate the driving forces that create and maintain domain registry across leaflets. Towards this, we formulated a Hamiltonian for a stacked lattice system where site variables encapsulate the lipid molecular properties including the position of unsaturation and various other interactions that could drive phase separation and interleaflet coupling. We solve the Hamiltonian using Monte Carlo simulations and create a complete phase diagram that reports the presence or absence of registered domains as a function of various Hamiltonian parameters. We find that the interleaflet coupling should be described as a competing enthalpic contribution due to interaction of lipid tail termini, primarily due to saturated-saturated interactions, and an interleaflet entropic contribution from overlap of unsaturated tail termini. We find that higher position of unsaturation provides weaker interleaflet coupling. We also find points in our parameter space that allow thermodynamically stable nanodomains in our bilayer model, which we have verified by carrying out extended Monte Carlo simulations. These persistent non-coalescing registered nanodomains close to the lower end of the accepted nanodomain size range also point towards a possible “nanoscale” emulsion description of lateral heterogeneities in biological membrane leaflets.</p>",2021-09-30

African weakly electric fishes (Mormyroidea) evolved a mosaically enlarged cerebellum and hindbrain, yet the relationship to their behaviorally novel electrosensory system remains unclear. We addressed this by studying South American weakly electric fishes (Gymnotiformes) and weakly electric catfishes (<italic>Synodontis</italic> spp.), which evolved varying aspects of electrosensory systems, independent of mormyroids. If the mormyroid mosaic increases are related to evolving an electrosensory system, we should find similar mosaic shifts in gymnotiforms and <italic>Synodontis</italic>. Using micro-computed tomography scans, we quantified brain region scaling for multiple electrogenic, electroreceptive, and non-electrosensing species. We found mosaic increases in cerebellum in all three electrogenic lineages relative to non-electric lineages and mosaic increases in torus semicircularis and hindbrain associated with the evolution of electrogenesis and electroreceptor type. These results show that evolving novel electrosensory systems is repeatedly and independently associated with changes in the sizes of individual brain regions independent of brain size, which suggests that selection can impact structural brain composition to favor specific regions involved in novel behaviors.</p>",2021-10-01

We investigate, based on a simple self-propelled particle model, how the emergence of ordered motion in a collectively moving group is influenced by the local rules of interactions among the individuals, namely, metric versus topological interactions as debated over in the current literature. In the case of the metric ruling, the individuals interact with the neighbours within a certain metric distance; in contrast, in the topological ruling, interaction is confined within a number of fixed nearest neighbours. Here, we explore how the range of interaction versus the number of fixed interacting neighbours affects the dynamics of flocking in an unbounded space, as observed in natural scenarios. Our study reveals the existence of a certain threshold value of the interaction radius in the case of metric ruling and a threshold number of interacting neighbours for the topological ruling to reach an ordered state. Interestingly, our analysis shows that topological interaction is more effective in bringing the order in the group, as observed in field studies.

We created two types of sequencing libraries: four libraries of Type A, where PCR reactions were run on individual samples before multiplexing, and three libraries of Type B, where PCRs were run on pooled samples. We used fixed pairs of inner barcodes to identify chimeric reads. Type B libraries show a higher percentage of misassigned reads (1.15%) compared to Type A libraries (0.65%).

Some of the challenges that limit the clinical/translational impact of hPSCs are high cost and difficulty in scaling-up of existing differentiation protocols. In this paper, we sought to address these challenges through the development of bioactive microcapsules. A co-axial flow focusing microfluidic device was used to encapsulate hPSCs in microcapsules comprised of an aqueous core and a hydrogel shell. Importantly, the shell contained heparin moieties for growth factor (GF) binding and release. The aqueous core enabled rapid aggregation of hPSCs into 3D spheroids while the bioactive hydrogel shell was used to load inductive cues driving pluripotency maintenance and endodermal differentiation. Specifically, we demonstrated that one-time 1h long loading of pluripotency signals, fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, into bioactive microcapsules was sufficient to induce and maintain pluripotency of hPSCs over the course of 5 days at levels similar to or better than a standard protocol with soluble GFs. Furthermore, stem cell-carrying microcapsules that previously contained pluripotency signals could be reloaded with an endodermal cue, Nodal, resulting in higher levels of endodermal markers compared to stem cells differentiated in a standard protocol. Overall, bioactive heparin-containing core-shell microcapsules decreased GF usage five-fold while improving stem cell phenotype and are well suited for 3D cultivation of hPSCs.</p>",2021-09-24

While some viruses exit this compartment early, others must reach the degradative, acidic environment of the late endosome. Mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) is one such late penetrating virus. To identify host factors that are important for reovirus infection, we performed a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (KO) screen that targets over 20,000 genes in fibroblasts derived from the embryos of C57/BL6 mice. We identified seven genes (WDR81, WDR91, RAB7, CCZ1, CTSL, GNPTAB, and SLC35A1) that were required for the induction of cell death by reovirus. Notably, CRISPR-mediated KO of WD repeat-containing protein 81 (WDR81) rendered cells resistant to reovirus infection. Susceptibility to reovirus infection was restored by complementing KO cells with human WDR81. Although the absence of WDR81 did not affect viral attachment efficiency or uptake into the endosomal compartments for initial disassembly, it delayed viral gene expression and diminished infectious virus production. Consistent with the role of WDR81 in impacting the maturation of endosomes, WDR81-deficiency led to the accumulation of reovirus particles in dead-end compartments. Though WDR81 was dispensable for infection by VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus), which exits the endosomal system at an early stage, it was required for VSV-EBO GP (VSV that expresses the Ebolavirus glycoprotein), which must reach the late endosome to initiate infection.

Despite similarities in drug cue-related SSRT and valence and arousal word ratings between groups, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity was diminished during the successful inhibition of drug versus food cues in CUD, and was correlated with lower frequency of recent use, lower craving, and longer abstinence (Z &gt; 3.1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 corrected). Results suggest reduced involvement of cognitive control regions (e.g., dlPFC) during inhibitory control under a drug context, relative to an alternative reinforcer, in CUD. Supporting the iRISA model, these results elucidate the direct impact of drug-related cue-reactivity on the neural signature of inhibitory control in drug addiction.</p><sec><title>Significance statement</title><p>Excessive salience attribution to drugs and related cues at the expense of nondrug reinforcers and cues and inhibitory control impairments are hallmark symptoms of drug addiction. Although these neuropsychological functions have been investigated independently, brain representations of their interaction are less clear. We illustrate that, despite matched behavioral performance and valence and arousal ratings, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex—a key node of the cognitive control network also associated with craving—exhibits decreased signaling when successfully inhibiting responses to drug compared to nondrug (food) cues (words) in cocaine-addicted individuals. Modulating salience while taxing self-control permits the study of their combined impact, an ecologically valid examination of the addiction experience. Better understanding inhibitory control under drug cue-reactivity may refine targeted neuromodulatory interventions.</p></sec>",2021-09-29

However, the relationship between alterations in the orientation of individual myofibrils and myofilaments to disease progression has been largely underexplored. This oversight has predominantly been due to a paucity of methods for objective and quantitative analysis. Here we introduce a novel, less-biased approach to quantify myofibrillar and myofilament orientation in cardiac muscle under near physiological conditions and demonstrate its superiority as compared to conventional histological assessments. Using small-angle X-ray diffraction, we first investigated changes in myofibrillar orientation at increasing sarcomere lengths in permeabilized, relaxed, wildtype mouse myocardium by assessing the angular spread of the 1,0 equatorial reflection (angle σ). At a sarcomere length (SL) of 1.9 μm, the angle σ was 0.23±0.01 rad, decreased to 0.19±0.01 rad at a SL of 2.1 μm, and further decreased to 0.15±0.01 rad at a SL of 2.3 μm (p&lt;0.0001). Angle σ was significantly larger in R403Q, a MYH7 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) model, porcine myocardium (0.24±0.01 rad) compared to WT myocardium (0.14±0.005 rad, p&lt;0.0001) as well as in human heart failure tissue (0.19±0.006 rad) when compared to non-failing samples (0.17±0.007 rad, p=0.01). These data indicate that diseased myocardium suffers from greater myofibrillar disorientation compared to healthy controls. Finally, we showed that conventional, histology-based analysis of disarray can be subject to user bias and/or sampling error and lead to false positives. Our method for directly assessing myofibrillar orientation avoids the artifacts introduced by conventional histological approaches that assess myocyte orientation and only indirectly evaluate myofibrillar orientation, and provides a precise and objective metric for phenotypically characterizing myocardium. The ability to obtain excellent X-ray diffraction patterns from frozen human myocardium provides a new tool for investigating structural anomalies associated with cardiac diseases.</p><sec><title>Statement of Significance</title><p>We introduce a precise and quantitative approach to directly measure myofibrillar and myofilament orientation in cardiac muscle under near physiological conditions as a novel tool for phenotypically characterizing striated muscle systems.

During such rapid reaches, express arm responses are the first wave of upper limb muscle recruitment, occurring within ~80-100 ms of target appearance. There is accumulating evidence that express arm responses arise from signaling along the tecto-reticulo-spinal tract, but the involvement of the reticulo-spinal tract has not been well-studied. Since the reticulospinal tract projects bilaterally, we studied whether express arm responses would be expressed bilaterally. Human participants (n = 14; 7 female) performed visually guided reaches in a modified emerging target paradigm where either arm could be used to intercept a target once it emerged below a barrier. We recorded electromyographic activity bilaterally from the pectoralis major muscle. Our analysis focused on target locations where participants reached with the right arm on some trials, and the left arm on others. In support of the involvement of the reticulospinal tract, the express arm response persisted bilaterally regardless of which arm reached to the target. While the latency of the express arm response was the same on the reaching vs non-reaching arm, the response magnitude was slightly larger on the reaching arm, in part due to anticipatory muscle recruitment related to arm choice. Our results support the involvement of the reticulo-spinal tract in mediating the express arm response, and we surmise that the increased magnitude on the arm chosen to move arises from convergence of cortically derived signals with the largely independent express arm response.</p><sec><title>New and Noteworthy</title><p>Express arm responses have been proposed to arise from the tecto-reticulo-spinal tract.

Evaluation of the oxidative stress, tau phorsphylation and synaptic impairment were performed using the hippocampus tissue of the rats by biochemical assays and immunofluorescence staining. Results from Morris water maze showed that the capacity of spatial memory is impaired in zinc-treated rats. Zinc sulfate significantly increased the levels of P-mTOR Ser2448, P-p70S6K Thr389, and P-tau Ser356, and decreased levels of Nrf2 and HO□1 in SH-SY5Y cells and in zinc-treated rats compared with control groups.

Moreover, we found that the collective dynamics characteristic of social animal groups persist into the sleep period, as baboons exhibited synchronized patterns of waking throughout the night, particularly with nearby group-mates. Thus, for animals whose fitness depends critically on avoiding predation and developing social relationships, maintaining sleep homeostasis may be only secondary to remaining vigilant when sleeping in risky habitats and interacting with group-mates during the night.

Numerous studies have used rodent models of maternal obesity to understand its consequences on the offspring, yet characterization of changes in the dams is rare, and most rodent models rely solely on a high fat diet to induce maternal obesity, without regarding genetic propensity for obesity. Here we present the influence of both peripartum high energy diet (HE) and obesity-proneness on maternal health using selectively-bred diet-resistant (DR) and diet-induced obese (DIO) rat dams. Outbred Sprague-Dawley rats were selected and bred according to their propensity to gain weight. From F1 onward, dams consuming a HE diet displayed higher body weight gain during pregnancy, and HE diet had a strong effect on meal patterns. Sensitivity to the hormone amylin was preserved during pregnancy, regardless of diet. After several rounds of selective breeding, dams from generation F3 were assessed for their postpartum physiology and behaviors. We observed strong diet and phenotype effects on gestational weight gain, with DIO-HE dams gaining 119% more weight than DR-chow. A high-resolution analysis of maternal behaviors on postpartum day 2 (P2) did not detect main effects of diet or phenotype, but a subset of DIO dams showed decreased pup-related behaviors. During a sucrose preference test (SPT) on P14, all DR dams consumed at least 70% sucrose, while a subset of DIO dams preferred water. In generation F6/F7 dams, effects on gestational weight gain persisted, and we observed a main effect of phenotype of SPT, with DIO-chow dams showing the lowest sucrose preference. Both DIO and DR dams consuming HE diet had severe postpartum liver lipidosis and exhibited reduced leptin sensitivity in the arcuate nucleus at the time of pup-weaning. These data demonstrate that both diet and genetic obesity-proneness have consequences on maternal health.</p>",2021-09-24

The prevalence of Avian haemosporidians, in above bird groups from northern, eastern, and southern parts of India and the phylogenetic genetic analysis of genetic lineages was carried out at world level to know the possible source of infection. The MCC tree revealed six Haemosporidian lineages in which one was common (H_MSP01) and five were unique (H_CYOPOL01, H_CHD01, H_CYORUB01, H_EUMTHA01, and P_GEOCIT01). The avian host richness Index was 2.0852. 9.9%, prevalence of <italic>Haemosporidian</italic> infection was found in 111 DNA samples belonging to 6 host species. The <italic>Haemoproteus</italic> prevalence was found to be 9.0% across five host species (<italic>Phylloscopus trochiloides, Cyornis poliogenys, C. hainanus dialilaemus, C. rubeculoides, Eumiyas thalassinus</italic>) and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> prevalence was 0.9% in <italic>Geokichla citrina</italic>. The spatial phylogeny map showed possible source populations of hosts having <italic>H. pallidus</italic> lineages COLL2 and PFC1 infections in parts of Africa, Europe, North America, Malaysia, and Philippines. The <italic>Plasmodium</italic> lineage (P_GEOCIT01) showed a weak (93.89%) similarity with PADOM16 in Egypt. The statistical analysis suggested that the haemosporidian’s host species’ distribution range was directly and significantly associated with the altitude, minimum temperature, and relative humidity.

Giraud'}, {'name': 'Anneleen Kool'}, {'name': 'Pål Karlsen'}, {'name': 'Alexis Annes'}, {'name': 'Irene Teixidor-Toneu'}]","<p>Wild edible plants as culturally-appropriate sources of nutrition and for food security are now well-recognised. In Europe, the use of wild edible plants is shifting from a subsistence activity to an emerging trend in high-end gastronomy. The environmental impacts of this shift are poorly known. Foraging is increasingly popular for personal consumption and commercially, not least in the Nordic countries where popularity is fuelled by the New Nordic Food movement. Here, we evaluate if this trend entails biodiversity conservation risks in Norway. In collaboration with the Norwegian Association for Mycology and Foraging, we conducted 18 face-to-face interviews with key stakeholders and we published an online questionnaire filled by 219 recreational and professional foragers. We enquired on what species are harvested, by whom and how, where do foragers learn and what are their perspectives on the sustainability of foraging. We combined these data with an assessment of foraging impact based on foraging pressure, ecological traits and conservation assessments. Our results show that 272 different wild edible plants are foraged and that this is mostly sustainable.</p><p>However, some risks arise from the harvest of threatened plants, the potential spread of invasive species, and the overharvesting of extremely popular or ‘fashionable’ species. Foraging fosters a strong connection with the natural environment and the majority of foragers report to forage as part of a sustainable lifestyle. We suggest that careful encouragement to forage and the participatory development of local guidelines for sustainable foraging in Norway can enhance people-nature relationships while safeguarding foraged plant populations.</p>",2021-09-27

We aimed to better understand the genetic architecture of BMI trajectory across ages and how BMI is affected by Native American genetic ancestry. We performed cross-sectional and longitudinal GWAS for BMI-related traits on 904 admixed Chilean children with mostly European and Mapuche Native American genetic ancestry. We focused on BMI and two traits that occur at the minimum of the childhood BMI growth trajectory, namely, age at adiposity rebound (Age-AR) and BMI at adiposity rebound (BMI-AR). We found several variants in the immune gene <italic>HLA-DQB3</italic> that are strongly associated with BMI at ages 1.5-2.5 years old, but not at other ages.

The initial phase of such adsorption process can only be probed using modelling approaches like molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Despite a large number of studies on the adsorption behaviour of proteins on different biomaterials including hydroxyapatite (HA); little attention has been paid towards quantitative assessment of the effects of various physicochemical influencers like surface modification, pH, and ionic strength. Among these factors, surface modification through isomorphic substitution of foreign ions inside the apatite structure is of particular interest in the context of protein-HA interaction as it is widely used to tailor the biological response of HA. Given this background, we present here the molecular-level understanding of fibronectin (FN) adsorption mechanism and kinetics on Sr<sup>2+</sup>-doped HA (001) surface, at 300K by means of all-atom molecular dynamics simulation. Electrostatic interaction involved in adsorption of FN on HA was found to be significantly modified in presence of Sr<sup>2+</sup> doping in apatite lattice. In harmony with the published experimental observations, the Sr-doped surface was found to better support FN adhesion compared to pure HA, with 10 mol% Sr-doped HA exhibiting best FN adsorption. Sr<sup>2+</sup> ions also influence the stability of the secondary structure of FN, as observed from the root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) analysis. The presence of Sr<sup>2+</sup> enhances the flexibility of specific residues (residue no. 20-44, 74-88) of the FN module. Rupture forces to disentangle FN from the biomaterials surface, obtained from steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, were found to corroborate well with the results of equilibrium MD simulations. One particular observation is that, the availability of RGD motif for the interaction with cell surface receptor integrin is not significantly influenced by Sr<sup>2+</sup> substitution. Summarizing, the present work establishes a quantitative foundation towards the molecular basis of the earlier experimentally validated better cytocompatibility of Sr-doped HA.

Sieve plate pore radii were extremely small: 0.08 µm in minor veins, increasing to 0.12µm in the petiole and only to 0.20µm at the base of the stem, tens of meters away. Searcher branches contained tube shaped phloem conduits with a pectin-rich wall, whereas twining stems displayed sieve elements with tangential connections that displayed a greater fraction of the tubes populated with an astonishing number of sieve plates.</p><p>Hydraulic segmentation of the leaves in Austrobaileyaceae correlate with vesseless leaves that benefit photoassimilate export through volumetric scaling of the sieve tube elements. Yet, compared with canopy dominant trees, the geometrical properties of the sieve tube in twining stems, restrict considerably energy distribution in the sub-canopy layers, potentially favoring the allocation of assimilates toward the elongating branches. Thus, the conductive xylem of twining stems contrasts with a poorly conductive phloem that meets the mechanical constraints of lianescence.</p>",2021-09-24
