Robinson'}, {'name': 'Daniel Park'}, {'name': 'Oliver Speck'}, {'name': 'Jonathan R. Polimeni'}]","<p>The pial arterial vasculature of the human brain is the only blood supply to the neocortex, but quantitative data on the morphology and topology of these mesoscopic vessels (diameter 50–300 μm) remains scarce. Because it is commonly assumed that blood flow velocities in these vessels are prohibitively slow, non-invasive time-of-flight MRI angiography (TOF-MRA)—which is well-suited to high 3D imaging resolutions—has not been applied to imaging the pial arteries. Here, we provide a theoretical framework that outlines how TOF-MRA can visualize small pial arteries <italic>in vivo</italic>, by employing extremely small voxels at the size of individual vessels. We then provide evidence for this theory by imaging the pial arteries at 140-μm isotropic resolution using a 7T MRI scanner and prospective motion correction, and show that pial arteries one voxel-width in diameter can be detected. We conclude that imaging pial arteries is not limited by slow blood flow, but instead by achievable image resolution. This study represents the first targeted, comprehensive account of imaging pial arteries <italic>in vivo</italic> in the human brain. This ultra-high-resolution angiography will enable the characterization of pial vascular anatomy across the brain to investigate patterns of blood supply and relationships between vascular and functional architecture.</p>",2021-06-10

Untargeted post-injection deposition of gadolinium <italic>in vivo</italic>, and association with diseases like nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, has alerted regulatory agencies to re-evaluate their widespread use and generated calls for safer gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). Increasing anthropogenic gadolinium in surface water has also raised concerns of potential bioaccumulation in plants and animals. Methylotrophic bacteria can acquire, transport, store and use light lanthanides as part of a cofactor complex with pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), an essential component of XoxF-type methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs), a critical enzyme for methylotrophic growth with methanol. We report robust gadolinium-dependent methanol growth of a genetic variant of <italic>Methylorubrum extorquens</italic> AM1, named <italic>evo</italic>-HLn, for evolved for heavy lanthanides. Genetic adaptation of <italic>evo</italic>-HLn resulted in increased <italic>xox1</italic> promoter and XoxF MDH activities, transport and storage of Gd<sup>3+</sup>, and augmented biosynthesis of PQQ. Gadolinium-grown cells exhibited a shorter T1 relaxation time compared to cells with lanthanum or no lanthanide when analyzed by MRI. In addition, <italic>evo</italic>-HLn was able to grow on methanol using the GBCA Gd-DTPA as the sole gadolinium source, showing the potential of this strain for the development of novel GBCAs and gadolinium recovery from medical waste and/or wastewater.</p>",2021-06-12

A major contributor to this information gap is the lack of a uniform paradigm for chronically manipulating activity at different developmental stages. To overcome this limitation, we utilized Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to directly suppress neuronal activity in layer (L) 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex (V1) at two important developmental timepoints: the classic visual system critical period (CP, P24-29), and adulthood (P45-55). We show that 24 hours of DREADD-mediated activity suppression simultaneously induces excitatory synaptic scaling up and intrinsic homeostatic plasticity in L2/3 pyramidal neurons during the CP, consistent with previous observations using prolonged visual deprivation. Importantly, manipulations known to block these forms of homeostatic plasticity when induced pharmacologically or via visual deprivation also prevented DREADD-induced homeostatic plasticity. We next used the same paradigm to suppress activity in adult animals. Surprisingly, while excitatory synaptic scaling persisted into adulthood, intrinsic homeostatic plasticity was completely absent. Finally, we found that homeostatic changes in quantal inhibitory input onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons were absent during the CP but present in adults. Thus, the same population of neurons can express distinct sets of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms at different development stages. Our findings suggest that homeostatic forms of plasticity can be recruited in a modular manner according to the evolving needs of a developing neural circuit.</p>",2021-06-12

They are divided into Type I and Type II that differ in domain structure, functional roles, and rates of evolution. In flowering plants, major evolutionary innovations like flowers, ovules and fruits have been closely connected to Type II MADS-box TFs. The role of Type I MADS-box TFs in angiosperm evolution remains to be identified. Here, we show that the formation of angiosperm-specific Type I MADS-box clades of Mγ and Mγ-interacting Mα genes (Mα*) can be tracked back to the ancestor of all angiosperms. Angiosperm-specific Mγ and Mα* genes were preferentially expressed in the endosperm, consistent with their proposed function as heterodimers in the angiosperm-specific embryo-nourishing endosperm tissue. We propose that duplication and diversification of Type I MADS-genes underpins the evolution of the endosperm, a developmental innovation closely connected to the origin and success of angiosperms.</p>",2021-06-09

Human natural defense mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown. Serine proteases (SPs) including furin and TMPRSS2 cleave SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, facilitating viral entry. Here, we show that FXa, a SP for blood coagulation, is upregulated in COVID-19 patients compared to non-COVID-19 donors and exerts anti-viral activity. Mechanistically, FXa cleaves the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which prevents its binding to ACE2, and thus blocks viral entry. Furthermore, the variant B.1.1.7 with several mutations is dramatically resistant to the anti-viral effect of FXa compared to wild-type SARA-CoV-2 <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. The anti-coagulant rivaroxaban directly inhibits FXa and facilitates viral entry, whereas the indirect inhibitor fondaparinux does not. In a lethal humanized hACE2 mouse model of SARS-CoV-2, FXa prolonged survival while combination with rivaroxaban but not fondaparinux abrogated this protection. These preclinical results identify a previously unknown SP function and associated anti-viral host defense mechanism and suggest caution in considering direct inhibitors for prevention or treatment of thrombotic complications in COVID-19 patients.</p>",2021-06-08

Ferguson'}, {'name': 'Gerald S. Shadel'}, {'name': 'Pietro De Camilli'}]","<p>Mutations in VPS13C cause early onset, autosomal recessive Parkinson’s Disease (PD). We have established that VPS13C encodes a lipid transfer protein localized to contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and late endosomes/lysosomes. In the current study, we demonstrate that depleting VPS13C in HeLa cells causes an accumulation of lysosomes with an altered lipid profile, including an accumulation of di-22:6-BMP, a biomarker of the PD-associated leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) G2019S mutation. In addition, the DNA-sensing cGAS/STING pathway, which was recently implicated in PD pathogenesis, is activated in these cells. This activation results from a combination of elevated mitochondrial DNA in the cytosol and a defect in the degradation of activated STING, a lysosome-dependent process. These results suggest a link between ER-lysosome lipid transfer and innate immune activation and place VPS13C in pathways relevant to PD pathogenesis.</p>",2021-06-08

T cell surface receptors that influence interactions and function in the TME are already proven targets for cancer immunotherapy. However, surface proteome remodeling of primary human T cells in response to suppressive forces in the TME has never been characterized systematically. Using a reductionist cell culture approach with primary human T cells and SILAC-based quantitative cell surface capture glycoproteomics, we examined how two immunosuppressive TME factors, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and hypoxia, globally affect the activated CD8<sup>+</sup> surface proteome (surfaceome). Surprisingly, the CD8<sup>+</sup>/Treg co-culture only modestly affected the CD8<sup>+</sup> surfaceome, but did reverse several activation-induced surfaceomic changes. In contrast, hypoxia dramatically altered the CD8<sup>+</sup> surfaceome in a manner consistent with both metabolic reprogramming and induction of an immunosuppressed state. The CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell surfaceome similarly responded to hypoxia, revealing a novel hypoxia-induced surface receptor program. Our findings are consistent with the premise that hypoxic environments create a metabolic challenge for T cell activation, which may underlie the difficulty encountered in treating solid tumors with immunotherapies. Together, the data presented here provide insight into how suppressive TME factors remodel the T cell surfaceome and represent a valuable resource to inform future therapeutic efforts to enhance T cell function in the TME.</p>",2021-06-07

Owing to fast, reproducible, and light-tunable dynamics, our system enables dynamic control of consortia composition in continuous cultures for extended periods.

Mathew'}]","<p>The spike (S) protein is a trimeric, membrane-anchored fusion protein that enables coronaviruses, such as the SARS-CoV-2, to recognize and fuse with their hosts’ cells. While the prefusion and postfusion structures of the ectomembrane domain of the spike protein are available, the corresponding organization of its transmembrane domain is obscure. Since the transmembrane and ectomembrane domains of fusion proteins are conformationally linked, an understanding of trimerization and transmembrane conformations in the viral envelope is a prerequisite to completely understand viral fusion by the spike protein. To address this, we computationally explored the self-assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 spike transmembrane domain, starting first by determining the membrane boundaries of the spike transmembrane helix. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we found the spike protein transmembrane domain to be plastic, and the transmembrane helix to be very dynamic. The observed movements of the helix changed the membrane embedded sequence, and thereby affected the conformational ensemble of the transmembrane assembly in Martini coarse grained simulations, even flipping the super-helical handedness. Analysis of the transmembrane organization of the spike transmembrane helix provided rich insights into the interfaces utilized to self-associate. Moreover, we identified two distinct cholesterol binding regions on the transmembrane helix with different affinities for the sterol. The cholesterol binding pockets overlapped with regions involved in the initiation of transmembrane protein-protein interaction. Together, the results from our multiscale simulations not only provide insight into understudied trimeric helical interfaces in biomembranes, but also enhance our understanding of the elusive transmembrane conformational dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spike and more generally of viral fusion proteins. These insights should enable the inclusion of the conformations of the spike protein transmembrane domain into the prevalent models of virus fusion.</p><sec><title>Significance</title><p>Enveloped viruses rely on fusion proteins, called spike proteins in coronaviruses, to infect cells by fusing the virus envelope with the host cell membrane.

Using multiscale molecular dynamics simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 spike TMD, we explore its conformational dynamics and self-assembly in different lipid environments. The results provided here improve our understanding of transmembrane stabilization of spike trimers, which are indispensable for viral infection.

At the present, SNV detection from 10x Genomics scRNA-seq data is typically performed on the pooled sequencing reads across all cells in a sample. Here, we assess the gain of information of SNV assessments from individual cell scRNA-seq data, where the alignments are split by barcode prior to the variant call. For our analyses we use publicly available sequencing da-ta on the human breast cancer cell line MCF7 cell line generated at consequent time-points during anticancer treatment. We analysed SNV calls by three popular variant callers, GATK, Strelka2 and Mutect2, in combination with a method for cell-level tabulation of the sequencing read counts bearing SNV alleles, SCReadCounts. Our analysis shows that variant calls on individual cell alignments identify at least two-fold higher number of SNVs as compared to the pooled scRNA-seq. We demonstrate that scSNVs exclusively called in the single cell alignments (scSNVs) are substantially enriched in novel genetic variants and in coding functional annotations, in particular, stop-codon and missense substitutions. Furthermore, we find that the expression of some scSNVs correlates with the expression of their harbouring gene (cis-scReQTLs). Overall, our study indicates an immense potential of SNV calls from individual cell scRNA-seq data and emphasizes on the need of cell-level variant detection approaches and tools. Given the growing accumulation of scRNA-seq datasets, cell-level variant assessments are likely to significantly contribute to the understanding of the cellular heterogeneity and the relationship between genetics variants and functional phenotypes.

Unique KSHV genes absent from other human herpesvirus genomes, known as K-genes, are typically important for KSHV replication and pathogenesis. Among the K-genes, the kaposin mRNA is highly expressed in both latent and lytic phases of infection, but its polycistronic nature has hindered methodical analysis of the role of kaposin translation products in viral replication. At least three proteins are produced from the kaposin transcript, Kaposin A (KapA), B (KapB), and C (KapC). We have previously shown that KapB overexpression is sufficient to recapitulate two KS phenotypes, EC spindling and elevated proinflammatory cytokine transcripts, the latter which proceeds via the disassembly of RNA decay granules called processing bodies (PBs). To pinpoint the relative contributions of kaposin proteins at different stages of KSHV infection, we constructed four recombinant viruses by deleting or recoding the kaposin locus. Latent infection of iSLK cells with kaposin-deficient viruses resulted in reduced viral genome copy number and small LANA nuclear bodies; despite this, all iSLK cells were capable of progeny virion production. De novo infection of ECs revealed that KapB was dispensable for EC spindling but required for PB disassembly during KSHV latency, suggesting other viral proteins contribute to spindling. These findings demonstrate that our panel of viruses enables precise analysis of respective contributions of individual kaposin proteins to KSHV replication.

In this way, we aimed to characterize and distinguish both short-term and long-term modifications in the brain’s structure and function. First, we performed a network-based analysis of anatomical connectivity. Then, to analyze the fMRI data, we calculated whole-brain effective connectivity (EC) estimates, relying on a dynamical network model to replicate BOLD signals’ spatio-temporal structure, akin to FC with lagged correlations. We compared the estimated EC, FC, and SC links as features to train classifiers to predict behavioral conditions and group identity. The whole-brain SC analysis revealed strengthened anatomical connectivity across large-scale networks for meditators compared to controls. We found that differences in SC were reflected in the functional domain as well. We demonstrated through a machine-learning approach that EC features were more informative than FC and SC solely. Using EC features we reached high performance for the condition-based classification within each group and moderately high accuracies when comparing the two groups in each condition.

Variants of concern (VOC) carrying mutations in the RBD or other regions of S reduce the effectiveness of many nAbs and vaccines by evading neutralization. Therefore, therapies that are less susceptible to resistance are urgently needed. Here, we characterized the memory B-cell repertoire of COVID-19 convalescent donors and analyzed their RBD and non-RBD nAbs. We found that many of the non-RBD-targeting nAbs were specific to the N-terminal domain (NTD). Using neutralization assays with authentic SARS-CoV-2 and a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus carrying SARS-CoV-2 S protein (rVSV-SARS2), we defined a panel of potent RBD and NTD nAbs. Next, we used a combination of neutralization-escape rVSV-SARS2 mutants and a yeast display library of RBD mutants to map their epitopes. The most potent RBD nAb competed with hACE2 binding and targeted an epitope that includes residue F490. The most potent NTD nAb epitope included Y145, K150 and W152. As seen with some of the natural VOC, the neutralization potencies of COVID-19 convalescent sera were reduced by 4-16-fold against rVSV-SARS2 bearing Y145D, K150E or W152R spike mutations. Moreover, we found that combining RBD and NTD nAbs modestly enhanced their neutralization potential.

Then, they flower gregariously within a short period. As with all grasses, they are monocarpic and produce a large quantity of seeds before dying. Entire forests temporarily disappear during these periods, and the dates of these dramatic events have been recorded over the last 200 years. I have found that the concentrations of flowering cycles were highly correlated with the series of successive returns of almost the same sun-moon phasing as at seedling emergence. On basis of knowledge on plant photoperiod sensitivity, I hypothesize that bamboo plants i) run a lunar cellular clock that is set at the full moon, ii) retain in their cellular memory the exact sun-moon phasing of the year of their emergence as seedlings, and iii) inhibit flowering until the occurrence of a unique, species-specific sun-moon phasing that is shifted by a precise amount from the sun-moon phasing at their emergence.

The ‘everything is everywhere’ hypothesis suggests they are not, at least not to the same extent. Here we characterize the structure of intertidal microbial biofilm communities and compare the intensity of zonation at the ‘species’ level, changes in taxonomic diversity and composition at the community level, and network attributes, with those observed in co-occurring macroalgae and invertebrates. At the level of species and OTUs, for dominant macro and microorganisms respectively, microbes showed less variability across the tidal gradient than macroorganisms. At the community-level, however, microbes and macro-organisms showed similarly strong patterns of tidal zonation, with major changes in composition and relative abundances across tides. Moreover, the proportion of ‘environmental specialists’ in different tidal zones was remarkably similar in micro and macroscopic communities, and taxonomic richness and diversity followed similar trends, with lower values in the high intertidal zone. Network analyses showed similar connectivity and transitivity, despite the large differences in absolute richness between the groups. A high proportion of positive co-occurrences within all tidal zones and mostly negative links between the high and low tidal zones were observed among habitat specialist taxa of micro-and macro-organisms. Thus, our results provide partial support to the idea that microbes are less affected by environmental variability than macroscopic counterparts. At the species-level, the most common microbe species exhibit less variation across tides than most common macroscopic organisms, suggesting the former perceive a more homogeneous environment and/or are more resistant to the associated stress. At the community-level, most indicators of community and network structure across the gradient are similar between microbes and macro-organisms, suggesting that despite orders of magnitude differences in richness and size, these two systems respond to stress gradients, giving rise to zonation patterns.</p>",2021-06-09

In this paper we present a hierarchical model that represents both flexible and modular aspects of intrinsic brain organization across time by constructing spatiotemporally flexible subnetworks. We also demonstrate that segregation and integration are complementary and simultaneous events. The method is based on combining the instantaneous phase synchrony analysis (IPSA) framework with community detection to identify a small, yet representative set of subnetwork components at the finest level of spatial granularity. At the next level, subnetwork components are combined into spatiotemporally flexibly subnetworks where temporal lag in the recruitment of areas within subnetworks is captured. Since individual brain areas are permitted to be part of multiple interleaved subnetworks, both modularity as well as more flexible tendencies of connectivity are accommodated for in the model. Importantly, we show that assignment of subnetworks to the same community (integration) corresponds to positive phase coherence within and between subnetworks, while assignment to different communities (segregation) corresponds to negative phase coherence or orthogonality. Together with disintegration, i.e. the breakdown of internal coupling within subnetwork components, orthogonality facilitates reorganization between subnetworks. In addition, we show that the duration of periods of integration is a function of the coupling strength within subnetworks and subnetwork components which indicates an underlying metastable dynamical regime. Based on the main tendencies for either integration or segregation, subnetworks are further clustered into larger meta-networks that are shown to correspond to combinations of core resting-state networks. We also demonstrate that subnetworks and meta-networks are coarse graining strategies that captures the quasi-cyclic recurrence of global patterns of integration and segregation in the brain.

To determine the mechanisms by which the Pink1-parkin pathway operates in vivo, we developed methods to detect Ser65-phosphorylated ubiquitin (pS65-Ub) in Drosophila. Exposure to the oxidant paraquat led to robust, Pink1-dependent pS65-Ub production. Surprisingly, parkin-null flies displayed strikingly elevated basal levels of pS65-Ub, suggestive of disrupted flux through the Pink1-parkin pathway. Depletion of the core autophagy proteins Atg1, Atg5 and Atg8a did not cause pS65-Ub accumulation to the same extent as loss of parkin, and overexpression of parkin was able to reduce both basal and paraquat-induced pS65-Ub levels in an Atg5-null background.

However, the efficacy of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, when tested in South Africa after the emergence of  501Y.V2, was not adversely impacted. We therefore assessed the binding and neutralization capacity of n=120 South African sera (from Day 29, post-vaccination) from the Janssen phase 3 study, Ensemble. Spike binding assays using both the Wuhan-1 D614G and 501Y.V2 Spikes showed high levels of cross-reactivity. In contrast, in a subset of 27 sera, we observed significantly reduced neutralization of 501Y.V2 compared to Wuhan-1 D614G, with 22/27 (82%) of sera showing no detectable neutralization of 501Y.V2 at Day 29. These data suggest that even low levels of neutralizing antibodies may contribute to protection from moderate/severe disease. In addition, Fc effector function and T cells may play an important role in protection by this vaccine against 501Y.V2.</p>",2021-06-09

These declines correlate with neuronal changes in synaptic structure and function. Degradation of brain network activity and connectivity represents a likely mediator of age-related functional deterioration resulting from these neuronal changes. Human studies have demonstrated both general decreases in spontaneous cortical activity and disruption of cortical networks with aging. Current techniques used to study cerebral network activity are hampered either by limited spatial resolution (e.g. electroencephalography, EEG) or limited temporal resolution (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI). Here we utilize mesoscale imaging of neuronal activity in <italic>Thy1-</italic>GCaMP6f mice to characterize neuronal network changes in aging with high spatial resolution across a wide frequency range. We show that while evoked activity is unchanged with aging, spontaneous neuronal activity decreases across a wide frequency range (0.01-4Hz) involving all regions of the cortex. In contrast to this global reduction in cortical power, we found that aging is associated with functional connectivity (FC) deterioration of select networks including somatomotor, cingulate, and retrosplenial nodes. These changes are corroborated by reductions in homotopic FC and node degree within somatomotor and visual cortices. Finally, we found that whole cortex delta power and delta band node degree correlate with exploratory activity in young but not aged animals. Together these data suggest that aging is associated with global declines in spontaneous cortical activity and focal deterioration of network connectivity, and that these reductions may be associated with age-related behavioral declines.</p>",2021-06-10

In cortex, they occur simultaneously in cell assemblies in different layers and propagate as traveling waves, a concerted activity at multiple scales whose interplay and role is still under debate. Slow oscillations have been reported to start in deep layers, more specifically in layer 5. Here, we studied the laminar organization of slow oscillations in the anesthetized rat cortex and we found that the activity leading to Up states actually initiates in layer 6, then spreads towards upper layers. Layer 5 cell assemblies have a threshold-like activation that can persist after layer 6 inactivation, giving rise to hysteresis loops like in “flip-flop” computational units. We found that such hysteresis is finely tuned by the columnar circuitry depending on the recent history of the local ongoing activity. Furthermore, thalamic inactivation reduced infragranular excitability without affecting the columnar activation pattern. We propose a role for layer 6 acting as a hub unraveling a hierarchy of cortical loops.</p>",2021-06-10

Transcriptomic analysis of aortas showed upregulation of genes related to inflammation and cell stress response. Compared to water, survival rate of Col3a1+/G182R mice was not affected by beta-blockers (propranolol or celiprolol).

To manage patients with suspected coronavirus disease (COVID-19) when they arrive at the hospital emergency department (ED), a clinical severity score is required to quickly identify patients requiring immediate hospital admission and close monitoring. The aim of this study was to evaluate, within the context of the pandemic, the performance of National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS-2) to anticipate the admission of patients with suspected COVID-19 to a specialised emergency care unit.
Methods. This retrospective study was conducted on patients presenting at the COVID-19 entrance of the ED of the Vert-Galant private hospital (Paris, France) during the first national pandemic peak from March 20 to April 20, 2020. All patients completed a questionnaire and clinical data and vital signs were recorded. Statistical analysis and modelling were used to estimate the ability of different scores (NEWS-2, qSOFA, CRB-65) to predict hospital emergency admission and/or early COVID-19 diagnosis. 
Results. NEWS-2, with a cut off value of 5, predicted hospital admission with 82% sensitivity, 98% specificity and an area under the curve (AUC) of 96%. NEWS-2 was superior to qSOFA and CRB-65 scores for predicting hospital admission of COVID-19 patients. Multilinear or logistic regression analysis of clinical data did not improve this result. 
Conclusion. NEWS-2 is an excellent score to predict hospital admission of COVID-19 patients.</p>",2021-06-12

Esteves'}]","<p>Programmed cell death is a vital process in the life cycle of an organism. Necroptosis, an evolutionary restricted form of programmed necrosis, contributes to the innate immune response by killing pathogen-infected cells. This virus-host interaction pathway is organized around two key components: the receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), which recruits and phosphorylates the mixed lineage kinase-like protein (MLKL), thus inducing cellular plasma membrane rupture and cell death. Critically, the presence of necroptotic inhibitors in viral genomes validates necroptosis as an important host defense mechanism. Here, we show, counterintuitively, that in different mammalian lineages of mammalian, central components of the necroptotic pathway, such as <italic>RIPK3</italic> and <italic>MLKL</italic> genes, are deleted or display inactivating mutations. Frameshifts or premature stop codons are observed in all the studied species of cetaceans and leporids. In carnivores’ genomes, the <italic>MLKL</italic> gene is deleted, while in a small number of species from afrotheria and rodentia premature stop codons are observed in <italic>RIPK3</italic> and/or <italic>MLKL</italic>. Interestingly, we also found a strong correlation between the disruption of necroptosis in leporids and cetaceans and the absence of the C-terminal domain of E3-like homologs (responsible for necroptosis inhibition) in their naturally infecting poxviruses. Overall, our study provides the first comprehensive picture of the molecular evolution of necroptosis in mammals. The loss of necroptosis multiple times during mammalian evolution highlights the importance of gene/pathway loss for species adaptation and suggests that necroptosis is not required for normal mammalian development. Moreover, this study highlights a co-evolutionary relationship between poxviruses and their hosts, emphasizing the role of host adaptation in shaping virus evolution.</p>",2021-06-08

Here, we apply multi-modal CITE-seq profiling to characterize granulocytes in human whole blood and bone marrow, and we show that these populations can be accurately detected and analyzed using the antibody-based modality, and that their frequencies and phenotype align well with antibody-based characterization of the same samples using CyTOF. These analyses also clearly highlight extremely low gene transcript detection across the entire granulocyte lineage including the earliest neutrophil progenitor populations when using the 10X Genomics platform.
