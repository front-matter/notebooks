However, a question remains whether vaccine breakthrough cases can still lead to Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), also known as Long Covid. To address this question, the Survivor Corps group, a grassroots COVID-19 organization focused on patient support and research, posted a poll to its 169,900 members that asked about breakthrough cases, Long Covid, and hospitalizations. 1,949 people who self-report being fully vaccinated have responded to date. While robust data are needed in a larger, unbiased sample to extrapolate rates to the population, we analyzed the results of this public poll to determine what people were reporting regarding Long Covid after breakthrough infection and to prompt discussion of how breakthrough cases are measured. The poll was posted in the Survivor Corps Facebook group (∼169,900 members). Of the 1,949 participants who responded to the poll, 44 reported a symptomatic breakthrough case and 24 of those reported that the case led to symptoms of Long Covid. 1 of these 24 cases was reported to have led to hospitalization in addition to Long Covid.</p>",2021-07-26

New'}, {'name': 'Iñaki Ruiz-Trillo'}]","<p>Significant increases in sedimentation rate accompany the evolution of multicellularity. These increases should lead to rapid changes in ecological distribution, thereby affecting the costs and benefits of multicellularity and its likelihood to evolve. However, how genetic and cellular traits which control this process, their likelihood of emergence over evolutionary timescales, and the variation in these traits as multicellularity evolves, are still poorly understood. Here, using isolates of the ichthyosporean <italic>Sphaeroforma</italic> genus - close unicellular relatives of animals with brief transient multicellular life stages - we demonstrate that sedimentation rate is a highly variable and evolvable trait affected by at least two distinct physical mechanisms. We first find a dramatic &gt;300x variation in sedimentation rate for different <italic>Sphaeroforma</italic> species, mainly driven by size and density during the unicellular-to-multicellular life cycle transition. Using experimental evolution with sedimentation rate as a focal trait, we readily obtained fast settling <italic>S. arctica</italic> isolates. Quantitative microscopy showed that increased sedimentation rates most often arose by incomplete cellular separation after cell division, leading to clonal “clumping” multicellular variants with increased size and density. Additionally, density increases arose by an acceleration of the nuclear doubling time relative to cell size. Similar size- and density-affecting phenotypes were observed in four additional species from the <italic>Sphaeroforma</italic> genus, suggesting variation in these traits might be widespread in the marine habitat. By sequencing evolved isolates, we identified mutations in regulators of cytokinesis, plasma membrane remodelling, and chromatin condensation that may contribute to both clump formation and the increase in the nuclear number-to-volume ratio. Taken together, this study illustrates how extensive cellular control of density and size drive sedimentation rate variation, likely shaping the evolution of multicellularity.</p>",2021-07-23

There is a plethora of different computational tools that process the raw MS data and derive peptide and protein identification and quantification. During the last decade, there has been dramatic progress in computer science and software engineering, including collaboration tools that have transformed research and industry. To leverage these advances, we developed AlphaPept, a Python-based open-source framework for efficient processing of large high-resolution MS data sets. Using Numba for just-in-time machine code compilation on CPU and GPU, we achieve hundred-fold speed improvements while maintaining clear syntax and rapid development speed. AlphaPept uses the Python scientific stack of highly optimized packages, reducing the code base to domain-specific tasks while providing access to the latest advances in machine learning. We provide an easy on-ramp for community validation and contributions through the concept of literate programming, implemented in Jupyter Notebooks of the different modules. A framework for continuous integration, testing, and benchmarking enforces solid software engineering principles. Large datasets can rapidly be processed as shown by the analysis of hundreds of cellular proteomes in minutes per file, many-fold faster than the data acquisiton. The AlphaPept framework can be used to build automated processing pipelines using efficient HDF5 based file formats, web-serving functionality and compatibility with downstream analysis tools. Easy access for end-users is provided by one-click installation of the graphical user interface, for advanced users via a modular Python library, and for developers via a fully open GitHub repository.</p>",2021-07-26

Lareau'}]","<p>Alternative splicing shapes the transcriptome and contributes to each cell’s unique identity, but single-cell RNA sequencing has struggled to capture the impact of alternative splicing. We previously showed that low recovery of mRNAs from single cells led to erroneous conclusions about the cell-to-cell variability of alternative splicing (1). Here, we present a method, Psix, to confidently identify splicing that changes across a landscape of single cells, using a probabilistic model that is robust against the data limitations of scRNA-seq. Its autocorrelation-inspired approach finds patterns of alternative splicing that correspond to patterns of cell identity, such as cell type or developmental stage, without the need for explicit cell clustering, labeling, or trajectory inference. Applying Psix to data that follow the trajectory of mouse brain development, we identify exons whose alternative splicing patterns cluster into modules of co-regulation. We show that the exons in these modules are enriched for binding by distinct neuronal splicing factors, and that their changes in splicing correspond to changes in expression of these splicing factors. Thus, Psix reveals cell-type-dependent splicing patterns and the wiring of the splicing regulatory networks that control them. Our new method will enable scRNA-seq analysis to go beyond transcription to understand the roles of post-transcriptional regulation in determining cell identity.</p>",2021-07-24

Especially in schools, the duration of stay is long and the number of people in the rooms is large, increasing the risk of infection. This problem particularly affects schools without pre-installed ventilation systems that are equipped with filters and/or operate with fresh air. Here, the aerosol concentration is reduced by natural ventilation. In this context, we are investigating the effect of large mobile air purifiers (AP) with HEPA filters on particle concentration and their suitability for classroom use in a primary school in Germany. The three tested APs differ significantly in their air outlet characteristics. Measurements of the number of particles, the particle size distribution, and the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration were carried out in the classroom with students (April/May 2021) and with an aerosol generator without students. In this regard, the use of APs leads to a substantial reduction in aerosol particles. At the same time, the three APs are found to have differences in their particle decay rate, noise level, and flow velocity. In addition to the measurements, the effect of various influencing parameters on the potential inhaled particle dose was investigated using a calculation model. The parameters considered include the duration of stay, particle concentration in exhaled air, respiratory flow rate, virus lifetime, ventilation interval, ventilation efficiency, AP volumetric flow, as well as room size. Based on the resulting effect diagrams, significant recommendations can be derived for reducing the risk of infection from virus-laden aerosols. Finally, the measurements were compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, as such tools can aid the optimal placement and configuration of APs and can be used to study the effect of the spread of aerosols from a source in the classroom.</p>",2021-07-26

Furthermore, a latent state model (a hidden markov model with generalized linear model observations) reveals that—even within a single task—the contribution of the two pathways to behavior is state-dependent. Specifically, the two pathways have large contributions in one of two states associated with a strategy of evidence accumulation, compared to a state associated with a strategy of repeating previous choices.

DynA does not prevent phage infection and replication in individual cells, but significantly delays host cell lysis, thereby slowing down the release of phage progeny from the host cells. During the process, DynA forms large, almost immobile clusters on the cell membrane that seem to support membrane integrity. Single molecule tracking revealed a shift of freely diffusive molecules within the cytosol towards extended, confined motion at the cell membrane following phage induction.

Incidence rates of infection among BNT162b2-vaccinated persons, with and without prior infection, were estimated, respectively, at 1.66 (95% CI: 1.26-2.18) and 11.02 (95% CI: 9.90-12.26) per 10,000 person-weeks. The incidence rate ratio was 0.15 (95% CI: 0.11-0.20). Analogous incidence rates among mRNA-1273-vaccinated persons were estimated at 1.55 (95% CI: 0.86-2.80) and 1.83 (95% CI: 1.07-3.16) per 10,000 person-weeks. The incidence rate ratio was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.34-2.05). Prior infection enhanced protection of those BNT162b2-vaccinated, but not those mRNA-1273-vaccinated. These findings may have implications for dosing, interval between doses, and potential need for booster vaccination.</p>",2021-07-26

In this study, we aimed to estimate the VE when combining the ChAdOx1 vaccine as the first dose and an mRNA vaccine as the second dose. 
Methods: This nationwide population-based cohort study estimated VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection, all-cause and COVID-19 related hospitalization and death after receiving the ChAdOx1 vaccine as the first dose followed by an mRNA vaccine as the second dose. VE estimates were obtained using a Cox regression with calendar time as underlying time and adjusted for sex, age, comorbidity, heritage and hospital admission. Information on all individuals was extracted and linked from high-quality national registries. 
Results: A total of 5,542,079 individuals were included in the analyses (97.6% of the total Danish population). A total of 144,360 were vaccinated with the ChAdOx1 vaccine as the first dose and of these 136,551 individuals received an mRNA vaccine as the second dose. A total of 1,691,464 person-years and 83,034 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection when combining the ChAdOx1 and an mRNA vaccine was 88% (95% confidence interval (CI): 83; 92) 14 days after the second dose and onwards. There were no COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths among the individuals vaccinated with the combination of the ChAdOx1 and an mRNA vaccine during the study period. 
Conclusion: In conclusion, this study found a reduction in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection when combining the ChAdOx1 and an mRNA vaccine, compared with unvaccinated individuals. This is similar to the VE of two doses of an mRNA vaccine. Longer follow-up time is needed to confirm vaccine induced protection against severe events, such as COVID-19 related hospitalization and death.</p>",2021-07-28

Our data shows that c-Myc induces replication stress by increasing the amount of cohesins bound to chromatin in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. This is independent of previously suggested mechanisms involving deregulation of replication initiation and transcriptional interference. Restoring the amount of chromatin-bound cohesins to control levels, or preventing the accumulation of cohesins at CTCF sites, in cells experiencing oncogenic c-Myc activity prevents replication stress. Increased cohesins chromatin occupancy correlates with a c-Myc-dependent increase in the levels of the cohesion loader Mau2. Preventing c-Myc-induced increase in Mau2 reduces oncogene-induced replication stress. Together our data support a novel mechanism for oncogene-induced replication stress.

We co-cultured two strains of Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, each harbouring a different antibiotic resistance gene, with 80α generalized transducing phage. After a growth phase of 8h, bacteria and phage surprisingly coexisted at a stable equilibrium in our culture, the level of which was dependent on the starting concentration of phage. We detected double-resistant bacteria as early as 7h, indicating that transduction of AMR genes had occurred. We developed multiple mathematical models of the bacteria and phage relationship, and found that phage-bacteria dynamics were best captured by a model in which the phage burst size decreases as the bacteria population reaches stationary phase, and where phage predation is frequency-dependent. We estimated that one in every 10<sup>8</sup> new phage generated was a transducing phage carrying an AMR gene, and that double-resistant bacteria were always predominantly generated by transduction rather than by growth. Our results suggest a fundamental shift in how we understand and model phage-bacteria dynamics.

First, we varied the explicit reward associated with the goal target and found an overall increase in movement vigor for higher reward targets, highlighted by larger velocities, feedback responses to external loads, and background muscle activity. Then, assuming that larger feedback gains were used to reject perturbations, we sought to investigate whether this effect hindered online decisions to switch to a new target in the presence of multiple successful goals. We indeed observed idiosyncratic switching strategies dependent on both target rewards and movement vigor, such that the more vigorous movements were less likely to switch to a new goal following perturbations. To gain further insight into a causal influence of movement vigor on rapid motor decisions, we demonstrated that biasing the baseline activity and reflex gains by means of a background load evoked a larger proportion of target switches in the direction opposite to the background load associated with lower muscle activity.

The engagement of peripheral circuits in the modulation of feedback gains was confirmed by the application of a background load that biased feedback vigor directionally, which evoked differences in switching behavior in the opposite direction.

However, causal disease genes at TWAS-associated loci generally remain unknown due to gene co-regulation, which leads to correlations across genes in predicted expression. We developed a new method, gene co-regulation score (GCSC) regression, to identify gene sets that are enriched for disease heritability explained by the predicted expression of causal disease genes in the gene set. GCSC regresses TWAS chi-square statistics on gene co-regulation scores reflecting correlations in predicted gene expression; GCSC determines that a gene set is enriched for disease heritability if genes with high co-regulation to the gene set have higher TWAS chi-square statistics than genes with low co-regulation to the gene set, beyond what is expected based on co-regulation to all genes. We verified via simulations that GCSC is well-calibrated, and well-powered to identify gene sets that are enriched for disease heritability explained by predicted expression.

Efforts to assess “zoonotic risk” often use trait-based analyses to identify which viral and reservoir host groups are most likely to source zoonoses but have not fully addressed how and why the impacts of zoonotic viruses vary in terms of disease severity (‘virulence’), capacity to spread within human populations (‘transmissibility’), or total human mortality (‘death burden’). We analyzed trends in human case fatality rates, transmission capacities, and total death burdens across a comprehensive dataset of mammalian and avian zoonotic viruses. Bats harbor the most virulent zoonotic viruses even when compared to birds, which alongside bats, have been hypothesized to be “special” zoonotic reservoirs due to molecular adaptations that support the physiology of flight. Reservoir host groups more closely related to humans—in particular, Primates—harbor less virulent, but more highly transmissible viruses. Importantly, disproportionately high human death burden, arguably the most important metric of zoonotic risk, is not associated with any animal reservoir, including bats. Our data demonstrate that mechanisms driving death burdens are diverse and often contradict trait-based predictions. Ultimately, total human mortality is dependent on context-specific epidemiological dynamics, which are shaped by a combination of viral traits and conditions in the animal host population and across and beyond the human-animal interface. Understanding the conditions that predict high zoonotic burden in humans will require longitudinal studies of epidemiological dynamics in wildlife and human populations.</p><sec><title>Significance statement</title><p>The clear need to mitigate zoonotic risk has fueled increased viral discovery in specific reservoir host taxa.

However, pandemic prevention requires thinking beyond zoonotic capacity, virulence, and transmissibility to consider collective ‘burden’ on human health. For this, viral discovery targeting specific reservoirs may be inefficient as death burden correlates with viral, not reservoir, traits, and depends on context-specific epidemiological dynamics across and beyond the human-animal interface. These findings suggest that longitudinal studies of viral dynamics in reservoir and spillover host populations may offer the most effective strategy for mitigating zoonotic risk.</p></sec>",2021-07-26

Maternal and paternal lines reflect the transmission of mtDNA and the Y-chromosome, respectively. We followed their transmission in real-time, from the 17th century down to its 20th-century population. We counted the number of married children of immigrants (i.e., their effective family size, EFS), estimated the proportion of successful immigrants in terms of their survival ratio, and assessed net growth rates and extinction. Likewise, we evaluated the same parameters for their Quebec-born descendants. The survival ratio of the first immigrants was the highest and declined over time in association with the decreasing immigrants EFS. Parents with high EFS left plentiful married progeny, putting EFS as the most important variable determining the parental demographic success throughout time for generations ahead. The 17th and 18th-century immigrants bear the most remarkable demographic and genetic impact on the 20th-century population of Quebec.

Survival during freshwater and marine migration is known to have population level effects, thus an understanding of the patterns of mortality has the potential to yield important insights into population bottlenecks. Despite important advancements in tracking techniques, the specifics of mortality events in anadromous salmonids during their initial migration to sea remains somewhat elusive. Here, we develop a framework combining spatial and temporal detections of smolt riverine migration from two tracking techniques, which enable inferences to be made about mortality locations, causes, and rates. We embed this framework into a fine-scale behaviour study of migration and social structure. In this study, we demonstrate that during their initial riverine transitional phase, smolts were particularly vulnerable to predators. Specifically, avian predation appeared to be the main cause of mortality (42%), although piscine predation events were not trivial (14%). Our results suggested some direct and indirect tagging-induced mortality (e.g., through increased predation vulnerability), which highlights the importance of determining tagging mortality in a telemetry study to ensure adequate interpretation of migration success. There is evidence that predation induced selection on smolt morphology. Unsuccessful river salmon migrants with a phenotype comprising a shorter head and jaw and smaller eye had a higher probability of mortality in the later parts of riverine migration where avian and aquatic predation mortality dominated. In contrast, mortality earlier in river migration was independent of phenotype, most likely a result of tagging effects. Successfully river migrants were found to be interacting with each other, often in a pair or as a trio, indicating that a few individuals of Atlantic salmon and sea trout formed notable intra- and interspecific social associations. However, the heterogeneity of the social associations of successful migrants did not support the assumption that social network features attributed any clear specific benefits of reduced predation risk. Overall, by estimating migration loss and its variability, our study framework should help to guide management actions to mitigate the widespread population declines these species are currently facing.</p>",2021-07-26

We introduce a general Bayesian framework to relax the assumption of independent divergences during phylogenetic inference, and test for patterns predicted by processes of diversification that affect multiple evolutionary lineages.

The studied trait-trait variations suggested: (i) the predominance of two resistance and resilience-related orthogonal axes, (ii) an overlap between a resilience axis and an axis of resource usage efficiency. These findings imply that resistance associated traits of prokaryotes are globally decoupled from resilience and resource use efficiencies associated traits. However, further inspection of pairwise scatterplots showed that resistance and resilience traits tended to be positively related for genomes up to roughly five million base pairs and negatively for larger genomes. This in turn precludes a globally consistent assignment of prokaryote genomic traits to the competitor - stress-tolerator -ruderal (CSR) schema that sorts species depending on their location along disturbance and productivity gradients into three ecological strategies and may serve as an explanation for conflicting findings from earlier studies. All reviewed genomic traits featured significant phylogenetic signals and we propose that our trait table can be applied to extrapolate genomic traits from taxonomic marker genes.

We also compared the adjuvanticity of heat-iMVA with several known vaccine adjuvants, including complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) and AddaVax, an MF59-like preclinical grade nano-emulsion. In addition, we tested whether co-administration of heat-iMVA plus tumor neoantigen peptides or irradiated tumor cells improves antitumor efficacy in a B16-F10 therapeutic vaccination model.

Heat-iMVA infection of bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) promoted antigen cross-presentation, whereas live MVA infection did not.

Here we investigate human and animal contacts and human health in a community living around the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP), Uganda. We used contact and health survey data to identify opportunities for cross-species pathogen transmission, focusing mostly on people and the endangered mountain gorilla. We conducted a survey with background questions and self-reported diaries to investigate 100 participants’ health, such as symptoms and behaviours, and contact patterns, including direct contacts and sightings over a week. Contacts were revealed through networks, including humans, domestic, peri-domestic, and wild animals for 1) network of contacts seen in the week of background questionnaire completion, 2) network of contacts seen during the diary week. Participants frequently felt unwell during the study, reporting from one to 10 disease symptoms at different intensity levels (maximum of seven symptoms in one day), with severe symptoms comprising 6.4% of the diary records and tiredness and headaches the most common symptoms. Besides human-human contacts, direct contacts with livestock and peri-domestic animals were the most common. Wildlife contacts were the rarest, including one direct contact with gorilla with a concerning timeline of reported symptoms. The contact networks were moderately connected and revealing a preference in contacts within the same species or taxon and within their groups. Despite sightings of wildlife being much more common than touching, one participant declared direct contact with a mountain gorilla during the week. Gorillas were seen very close to six animal taxa (including themselves) considering all interaction types, mostly seen closer to other gorillas, but also people and domestic animals. Our findings reveal a local human population with recurrent symptoms of illness in a location with intense exposure to factors that can increase pathogen transmission, such as direct contact with domestic and wild animals and proximity among animal species. Despite significant biases and study limitations, the information generated here can guide future studies, such as models for disease spread and One Health interventions.</p>",2021-07-23

To address this question, we extensively characterized non-transformed epithelial cells subjected to chronic cyclin E overproduction. Cells overproducing human cyclin E briefly experienced truncated G1 phases, then consistently endured a transient period of DNA replication origin underlicensing, replication stress, and severely impaired proliferation. Individual cells displayed substantial intercellular heterogeneity in both cell cycle dynamics and CDK activity.

Studies have shown that there is a benefit to associative memory if the configural context of associative pairs is maintained from encoding to retrieval. The current study aimed to examine whether this benefit of contextual congruency is reduced in aging, and whether the neural similarity of memory representations between targets and lures underlies age- related increases in false memories. Behaviorally, both age groups benefited from target pairs presented in a visual format that was congruent with how the pair was learned. While no age difference was observed in hits, the typical age-related increase in false alarms was found. Congruent with behavioral results, neither the relationship between target-related patterns of neural activity across memory phases (as measured by ERS) nor the discriminability of target classification as a function of condition at retrieval (as measured by MVPA). However, with regard to false memories, older adults exhibited overall lower pattern similarity for hits and FAs compared to hits and CRs (as measured by RSA). Additionally, Hit-FA RSA correlated with age- related increases in associative FAs across visual, frontal, and parietal cortices. Results suggest that while neural processes supporting associative memory retrieval are dependent on configural congruency between encoding and retrieval, there is no difference as to how congruency affects these processes in aging.

Our data illustrated a transposition-transcription process whereby properly sized MITEs transposed into active genic regions could be converted into new miRNAs, termed MITE-miRNAs, in as few as 20 generations. We showed that this molecular domestication mechanism leads to a possible evolutionary arms race between the MITEs and the host genomes that rapidly and continuously changes the miRNA repertoires.

We examined these three measures in a pediatric cohort (N≈3,000) over two chikungunya epidemics and one Zika epidemic and in a household cohort (N=1,793) over one COVID-19 epidemic in Nicaragua. Across different analyses and all epidemics, case incidence rates considerably underestimated both risk-based measures. Spatial infection risk differed from spatial disease risk, and typical case-only approaches precluded a full understanding of the spatial seroprevalence patterns.

As a result, the history of pig dispersal in the Philippines remains controversial and must have some anthropogenic origin associated with some human migration events. In this study, the context of origin, dispersal, and the level of genetic introgression in Philippine native pigs were deduced using mitochondrial DNA D-loop analysis altogether with domestic pigs and wild boars corresponding to their geographic origin. Results revealed a considerable genetic diversity (0.900±0.016), and a widespread Asian pig-ancestry (94.60%) were revealed in the phylogenetic analysis with admixed European pig-origin (5.10%) harboring various fractions of ancestry from Berkshire and Landrace. The close genetic connection between the continental wild boars and domestic pigs present in the Philippine pigs corroborates our hypothesis of a genetic signal that could potentially be associated with the recently reported multiple waves of human migrations to the Philippines during the last 50,000 years. The high frequency of haplotypes (54.08%) that collapsed in the D7 haplogroup represent an interesting challenge as its distribution does not coincide with the hypothesized migratory route of the Neolithic Austronesian-speaking populations.

This includes features such as orientation (cross-orientation suppression), eye-of-origin (interocular suppression) and spatial location (surround suppression), which are thought to involve distinct anatomical pathways. We asked if these separate routes to suppression can be differentiated by their pattern of gain control on the contrast response function measured in human participants using steady-state electroencephalography. Changes in contrast gain shift the contrast response function laterally, whereas changes in response gain scale the function vertically. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to summarise the evidence for each type of gain control. A computational meta-analysis of 16 previous studies found the most evidence for contrast gain effects with overlaid masks, but no clear evidence favouring either response gain or contrast gain for other mask types. We then conducted two new experiments, comparing suppression from four mask types (monocular and dichoptic overlay masks, and aligned and orthogonal surround masks) on responses to sine wave grating patches flickering at 5Hz. At the occipital pole, there was strong evidence for contrast gain effects in all four mask types at the first harmonic frequency (5Hz). Suppression generally became stronger at more lateral electrode sites, but there was little evidence of response gain effects. At the second harmonic frequency (10Hz) suppression was stronger overall, and involved both contrast and response gain effects. Although suppression from different mask types involves distinct anatomical pathways, gain control processes appear to serve a common purpose, which we suggest might be to suppress less reliable inputs.</p>",2021-07-27

We evaluated model performance using simulated communities, computing out-of-sample predictive accuracy and parameter recovery across different input sample sizes. We applied our method to a diverse empirical community, allowing us to disentangle the direct role of environmental gradients on species’ intrinsic growth rates from indirect effects via competitive interactions.

We found that, in wild-type <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larval neuroblasts, the frequency of Chromosome Breaks (CBs), induced by acute γ-radiation, is significantly reduced when flies are previously exposed to a protracted dose of 0.4 Gy delivered at a dose rate of 2.5 mGy/h. This indicates that this exposure, which is associated with an increased expression of DNA damage response proteins, induces a radioadaptive response (RAR) that protects Drosophila from extensive DNA damage. Interestingly, the same exposure reduces the frequency of telomere fusions (TFs) from Drosophila telomere capping mutants suggesting that the LDDR can generally promote a protective response on chromatin sites that are recognized as DNA breaks. Deep RNA sequencing revealed that RAR is associated with a modulation of genes involved in RNA processing and the reduction of expression of <italic>Loquacious D (Loqs-RD)</italic> gene that encodes a well-conserved dsRNA binding protein required for esiRNAs biogenesis. Remarkably, loss of <italic>Loqs</italic> mimics the LDDR-mediated chromosome protection as it decreases the IR-induced CBs and TF frequency.

With about 4.4 million people globally being affected, and another 43 million people bearing the sickle cell trait, several research efforts have been made to discover new and affordable treatment and possibly cure for the disease. Africa is endowed with a large flora population and traditional healers and citizens have over time depended on the use of herbs in folkloric medicine for different ailments including sickle cell disease (SCD). Such native knowledge has often formed the basis for different research exploration into the anti-sickling activities of selected African plants. These plants that have been so far investigated for their anti-sickling properties represent about 0.05 % of the 45,000 plant species enriching the flora landscape in Sub-Saharan Africa. Some of these have yielded potent anti-sickling profiles. In the current work we seek to achieve a more extensive search of the African plant diversity with anti-sickling properties: for this we have adopted a hybrid computational-cum-experimental protocol that employed computer-aided drug design (CADD) means for identifying plants with at least one constituent capable of interacting with the sickle hemoglobin, followed by extractive procedures and anti-sickling experiments for validating the predictions. Over two thousand (or 2,000) African natural products, representing over 200 plant species, were first virtually screened against the crystal structure of the dimerized human sickle hemoglobin. The natural products with the best computed sickle hemoglobin interaction energetics were found to belong to five plant species including Catharanthus roseus, Rauvolfia vomitoria, Hoslundia opposita, Lantana camara and Euphorbia hirta. The leaves of these plants were each collected subsequently and subjected to standard processing and extraction procedures. Using both HbSS polymerization inhibition and sickling reversal tests significant reductions in polymerization of erythrocyte hemolysate of the HbSS genotype were observed with the methanolic extracts of the plants, as well as sickling reversal levels of up to 68.50 % (H. opposita) was observed.</p>",2021-07-26

We trained mice in a selective whisker detection task, in which they learned to respond (lick) to target stimuli in one whisker field and ignore distractor stimuli in the contralateral whisker field. During expert task performance, we used widefield Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to assess prestimulus and post-stimulus neuronal activity broadly across frontal and parietal cortices. We found that lower prestimulus activity correlated with enhanced stimulus detection: lower prestimulus activity predicted response versus no response outcomes and faster reaction times. The activity predictive of trial outcome was distributed through dorsal neocortex, rather than being restricted to whisker or licking regions. Using principal component analysis, we demonstrate that response trials are associated with a distinct and less variable prestimulus neuronal subspace. For single units, prestimulus choice probability was weak yet distributed broadly, with lower than chance choice probability correlating with stronger sensory and motor encoding. These findings support a low amplitude, low variability, optimal prestimulus cortical state for stimulus detection that presents globally and predicts response outcomes for both target and distractor stimuli.</p>",2021-07-26

However, it is still poorly understood, which level of PAE is associated with facial manifestation and if such associations persist during childhood. 
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between PAE and children facial phenotype in a prospective multi-ethnic population-based study.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was based on the Generation R Study, a prospective cohort from fetal life onwards with maternal and offspring data. Children had a 3D facial image taken at ages 9 (n=3160) and 13 years (n=2492). 
EXPOSURES: We defined 6 levels of PAE based on the frequency and dose of alcohol consumption, and defined three tiers based on the timing of alcohol exposure of the unborn child.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:  For image analysis, we used 3D graph convolutional networks for non-linear dimensionality reduction, which compressed the high-dimensional images into 200 endophenotypes representing facial morphology. These facial endophenotypes were used as dependent variables in a linear regression analysis to search for associations with PAE. Finally, to detect specific facial components associated with PAE, we mapped statistically significant endophenotypes back to the 3D facial shape. We generated heatmaps to display the facial changes associated with PAE. PAE prediction based on facial shape was also performed; the prediction accuracy was estimated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
RESULTS: A significant association between PAE and facial shape was found in the 9-year-old children, at all levels of alcohol exposure: the higher the level of exposure, the stronger the association. Moreover, PAE before and during pregnancy was associated with facial shape. The most common detected facial phenotypes included turned-up nose tip, shortened nose, turned-out jaw and turned-in lower-eyelid-related regions. For the 13-year-old children, the associations were weaker and the AUCs lower than those of the 9-years-old children.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: PAE before and during pregnancy, even at low level, is associated with the facial shape of children, and these associations become weaker as children grow older.</p>",2021-07-25

Furthermore, PLCB4, the direct downstream effector of Gα<sub>q/11</sub> signaling, is frequently mutated in cutaneous melanoma alongside P53 and NF1. Our results suggest that a deficiency of PLCB4 promotes cutaneous melanomagenesis by reducing GNAQ driven signaling. Hence, our studies reveal the flip side of the GNAQ/PLCB4 signaling pathway, which was hitherto unsuspected. In the future, understanding how epidermal crosstalk restrains the GNAQ<sup>Q209L</sup> oncogene could suggest novel melanoma therapies.</p>",2021-07-26

In this work, we propose a deep learning approach to classify these diseases based on 3D T1-weighted brain MRI. We analyzed several datasets including the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), an independent dataset from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine (UPenn), the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset. PPMI and ADNI were partitioned to train (70%), validate (20%), and test (10%) a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for PD and AD classification. The UPenn and OASIS datasets were used as independent test sets to evaluate the model performance during inference. We also implemented a random forest classifier as a baseline model by extracting key radiomics features from the same T1-weighted MRI scans. The proposed 3D CNN model was trained from scratch for the classification tasks. For AD classification, the 3D CNN model achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.878 on the ADNI test set and an average ROC-AUC of 0.789 on the OASIS dataset. For PD classification, the proposed 3D CNN model achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.667 on the PPMI test set and an average ROC-AUC of 0.743 on the UPenn dataset. We also found that model performance was largely maintained when using only 25% of the training dataset. The 3D CNN outperformed the random forest classifier for both the PD and AD tasks. The 3D CNN also generalized better on unseen MRI data from different imaging centers. Our results show that the proposed 3D CNN model was less prone to overfitting for AD than for PD classification. This approach shows promise for screening of PD and AD patients using only T1-weighted brain MRI, which is relatively widely available. This model with additional validation could also be used to help differentiate between challenging cases of AD and PD when they present with similarly subtle motor and non-motor symptoms.</p>",2021-07-27

In order to understand its functional role, the characterization of the binding pathways to biomolecules such as RNA is crucial. Despite the importance, a molecular description is still lacking since the transition from the water-mediated outer-sphere to the direct inner-sphere conformation is on the millisecond timescale and therefore out of reach for conventional simulation techniques. To fill this gap, we use transition path sampling to resolve the binding pathways and to elucidate the role of the solvent in the reaction. The results reveal that the molecular void provoked by the leaving phosphate oxygen of the RNA is immediately filled by an entering water molecule. In addition, water molecules from the first and second hydration shell couple to the concerted exchange. To capture the intimate solute-solvent coupling, we perform a committor analysis as basis for a machine learning algorithm that derives the optimal deep learning model from thousands of scanned architectures using hyperparameter tuning. The results reveal that the properly optimized deep network architecture recognizes the important solvent structures, extracts the relevant information and predicts the commitment probability with high accuracy.

A quantitative understanding of the key processes driving EBOV assembly and budding could provide valuable insights to inform drug development. Here we used a computational model to evaluate EBOV matrix assembly. Our model focused on the assembly kinetics of VP40, the matrix protein in EBOV, and its interaction with phosphatidylserine (PS) in the host cell membrane. Human cells transfected with VP40-expressing plasmids are capable of producing virus-like particles (VLPs) that closely resemble EBOV virions. We used data from this in vitro VP40 system to calibrate our computational model. PS levels in the host cell membrane had been shown to affect VP40 dynamics as well as VLP production through recruiting VP40 dimers to plasma membrane inner leaflet. Our computational results indicated that PS may have direct influence on VP40 filament growth and affect multiple steps in the assembly and budding of VP40 VLPs. We also proposed that the assembly of VP40 filaments may follow the nucleation-elongation theory where initialization and oligomerization of VP40 are two separate and distinct steps in the assembly process. This work illustrated how computational and experimental approaches can be combined to allow for additional analysis and hypothesis generation.

By inviting a random sample of Facebook active users each day, CTIS collects information about COVID-19 symptoms, risks, mitigating behaviors, mental health, testing, vaccination, and other key priorities. The large scale of the survey – over 20 million responses in its first year of operation – allows tracking of trends over short timescales and allows comparisons at fine demographic and geographic detail. The survey has been repeatedly revised to respond to emerging public health priorities. In this paper, we describe the survey methods and content and give examples of CTIS results that illuminate key patterns and trends and help answer high-priority policy questions relevant to the COVID-19 epidemic and response. These results demonstrate how large online surveys can provide continuous, real-time indicators of important outcomes that are not subject to public health reporting delays and backlogs. The CTIS offers high value as a supplement to official reporting data by supplying essential information about behaviors, attitudes toward policy and preventive measures, economic impacts, and other topics not reported in public health surveillance systems.</p><sec><title>Significance statement</title><p>The U.S. COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) has operated continuously since April 6, 2020, collecting over 20 million responses. The largest public health survey ever conducted in the United States, CTIS was designed to facilitate detailed demographic and geographic analyses, track trends over time, and accommodate rapid response to emerging priorities. Using examples of CTIS results illuminating trends in symptoms, risks, mitigating behaviors, testing and vaccination in relation to evolving high-priority policy questions over 12 months of the pandemic, we illustrate the value of online surveys for tracking patterns and trends in COVID outcomes as an adjunct to official reporting, and showcase unique insights that would not be visible through traditional public health reporting.</p></sec>",2021-07-26

Studies have revealed inequalities along social determinants of health, but little investigation was conducted surrounding geographic concentration within cities. We quantified social determinants of geographic concentration of COVID-19 cases across sixteen census metropolitan areas (CMA) in four Canadian provinces.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We used surveillance data on confirmed COVID-19 cases at the level of dissemination area. Gini (co-Gini) coefficients were calculated by CMA based on the proportion of the population in ranks of diagnosed cases and each social determinant using census data (income, education, visible minority, recent immigration, suitable housing, and essential workers) and the corresponding share of cases. Heterogeneity was visualized using Lorenz (concentration) curves.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Geographic concentration was observed in all CMAs (half of the cumulative cases were concentrated among 21-35% of each city’s population): with the greatest geographic heterogeneity in Ontario CMAs (Gini coefficients, 0.32-0.47), followed by British Columbia (0.23-0.36), Manitoba (0.32), and Québec (0.28-0.37). Cases were disproportionately concentrated in areas with lower income, education attainment, and suitable housing; and higher proportion of visible minorities, recent immigrants, and essential workers. Although a consistent feature across CMAs was concentration by proportion visible minorities, the magnitude of concentration by social determinants varied across CMAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>The feature of geographical concentration of COVID-19 cases was consistent across CMAs, but the pattern by social determinants varied. Geographically-prioritized allocation of resources and services should be tailored to the local drivers of inequalities in transmission in response to SARS-CoV-2’s resurgence.</p></sec>",2021-07-26
