Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from PCR-confirmed, recovered COVID-19 convalescent patients (n=30) infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States collected in April and May 2020 who possessed at least one or more of six different HLA haplotypes were selected for examination of their anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T-cell responses using a multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer staining approach. This analysis examined if the previously identified viral epitopes targeted by CD8+ T-cells in these individuals (n=52 distinct epitopes) are mutated in the newly described Omicron VOC (n=50 mutations). Within this population, only one low-prevalence epitope from the Spike protein restricted to two HLA alleles and found in 2/30 (7%) individuals contained a single amino acid change associated with the Omicron VOC. These data suggest that virtually all individuals with existing anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T-cell responses should recognize the Omicron VOC, and that SARS-CoV-2 has not evolved extensive T-cell escape mutations at this time.</p><sec><title>Importance</title><p>The newly identified Omicron variant of concern contains more mutations than any of the previous variants described to date. In addition, many of the mutations associated with the Omicron variant are found in areas that are likely bound by neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that the first line of immunological defense against COVID-19 may be compromised. However, both natural infection and vaccination develop T-cell based responses, in addition to antibodies. This study examined if the parts of the virus, or epitopes, targeted by the CD8+ T-cell response in thirty individuals who recovered from COVID-19 in 2020 were mutated in the Omicron variant. Only one of 52 epitopes identified in this population contained an amino acid that was mutated in Omicron. These data suggest that the T-cell immune response in previously infected, and most likely vaccinated individuals, should still be effective against Omicron.</p></sec>",2021-12-09

Mawla'}, {'name': 'Talitha van der Meulen'}, {'name': 'Mark O. Huising'}]","<p>High throughput sequencing has enabled the interrogation of the transcriptomic landscape of glucagon-secreting alpha cells, insulin-secreting beta cells, and somatostatin-secreting delta cells. These approaches have furthered our understanding of expression patterns that define healthy or diseased islet cell types and helped explicate some of the intricacies between major islet cell crosstalk and glucose regulation. All three endocrine cell types derive from a common pancreatic progenitor, yet alpha and beta cells have partially opposing functions, and delta cells modulate and control insulin and glucagon release. While gene signatures that define and maintain cellular identity have been widely explored, the underlying epigenetic components are incompletely characterized and understood. Chromatin accessibility and remodeling is a dynamic attribute that plays a critical role to determine and maintain cellular identity. Here, we compare and contrast the chromatin landscape between mouse alpha, beta, and delta cells using ATAC-Seq to evaluate the significant differences in chromatin accessibility. The similarities and differences in chromatin accessibility between these related islet endocrine cells help define their fate in support of their distinct functional roles. We identify patterns that suggest that both alpha and delta cells are poised, but repressed, from becoming beta-like. We also identify patterns in differentially enriched chromatin that have transcription factor motifs preferentially associated with different regions of the genome. Finally, we identify and visualize both novel and previously discovered common endocrine- and cell specific- enhancer regions across differentially enriched chromatin.</p>",2021-12-06

How Omicron would evade RBD neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and humoral immunity requires immediate investigation. Here, we used high-throughput yeast display screening<sup>1,2</sup> to determine the RBD escaping mutation profiles for 247 human anti-RBD NAbs identified from SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 convalescents and vaccinees. Based on the results, NAbs could be unsupervised clustered into six epitope groups (A-F), which is highly concordant with knowledge-based structural classifications<sup>3–5</sup>. Strikingly, various single mutations of Omicron could impair NAbs of different epitope groups. Specifically, NAbs in Group A-D, whose epitope overlaps with ACE2-binding motif, are largely escaped by K417N, N440K, G446S, E484A, Q493K, and G496S. Group E (S309 site)<sup>6</sup> and F (CR3022 site)<sup>7</sup> NAbs, which often exhibit broad sarbecovirus neutralizing activity, are less affected by Omicron, but still, a subset of NAbs are escaped by G339D, S371L, and S375F. Furthermore, B.1.1.529 pseudovirus neutralization and RBD binding assay showed that single mutation tolerating NAbs could also be escaped due to multiple synergetic mutations on their epitopes. In total, over 85% of the tested NAbs are escaped by Omicron. Regarding NAb drugs, LY-CoV016/LY-CoV555 cocktail, REGN-CoV2 cocktail, AZD1061/AZD8895 cocktail, and BRII-196 were escaped by Omicron, while VIR7831 and DXP-604 still function at reduced efficacy. Together, data suggest Omicron could cause significant humoral immune evasion, while NAbs targeting the sarbecovirus conserved region remain most effective. Our results offer instructions for developing NAb drugs and vaccines against Omicron and future variants.</p>",2021-12-09

Here, we report a nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine that expresses the more conserved viral nucleoprotein (mRNA-N). We show that mRNA-N alone was able to induce a modest but significant control of SARS-CoV-2 in mice and hamsters. Critically, by combining mRNA-N with the clinically approved S-expressing mRNA vaccine (mRNA-S-2P), we found that combinatorial mRNA vaccination (mRNA-S+N) led to markedly enhanced protection against the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant compared to mRNA-S. In a hamster model, we demonstrated that while mRNA-S alone elicited significant control of the delta strain in the lungs (~45-fold reduction in viral loads compared to un-vaccinated control), its effectiveness in the upper respiratory tract was weak, whereas combinatorial mRNA-S+N vaccination induced markedly more robust control of the delta variant infection in the lungs (~450-fold reduction) as well as in the upper respiratory tract (~20-fold reduction). Immune analyses indicated that induction of N-specific immunity as well as augmented S-specific T-cell response and neutralizing antibody activity were collectively associated the enhanced protection against SARS-CoV-2 delta strain by combinatorial mRNA vaccination.

We used an early passage of isolated and sequence confirmed live Omicron virus isolated in South Africa. We used a human lung cell line clone (H1299-ACE2) engineered to express the ACE2 receptor (2) to both isolate the virus and test neutralization. We also tested growth in the parental H1299 which do not overexpress ACE2 and are not appreciably infectable with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig S1).

We tested 14 plasma samples from 12 participants (Table S1), with 6 having no previous record of SARS-CoV-2 infection nor detectable nucleocapsid antibodies indicative of previous infection. For two of these participants, we used samples from two timepoints. The remaining 6 participants had a record of previous infection in the first SARS-CoV-2 infection wave in South Africa where infection was with ancestral D614G virus (Table S1). Geometric mean titer (GMT) FRNT50 (inverse of the plasma dilution required for 50% reduction in infection foci number) was 1321 for D614G. These samples therefore had very strong neutralization of D614G virus, consistent with sampling soon after vaccination. GMT FRNT50 for the same samples was 32 for Omicron, a 41-fold decline (Fig 1B).

FPCountR relies on the generation of bespoke fluorescent protein (FP) calibrants, assays to determine protein concentration and activity, and a corresponding analytical workflow. We systematically characterise the assay protocols for accuracy, sensitivity and simplicity, and describe a novel ‘ECmax’ assay that outperforms the others and even enables accurate calibration without requiring the purification of FPs. To obtain cellular protein concentrations, we consider methods for the conversion of optical density to either cell counts or alternatively to cell volumes, as well as examining how cells can interfere with protein counting via fluorescence quenching, which we quantify and correct for the first time. Calibration across different instruments, disparate filter sets and mismatched gains is demonstrated to yield equivalent results. It can also reveal that mCherry absorption at 600nm does not confound cell density measurements unless expressed to over 100,000 proteins per cell. FPCountR is presented as pair of open access tools (protocol and R package) to enable the community to use this method, and ultimately to facilitate the quantitative characterisation of synthetic microbial circuits.</p>",2021-12-06

It is not clear, however, whether imagery vividness is constant across the lifespan or changes during development and later in life. Without enforcing the constraints of strict experimental procedures and representativity across the entire population, our purpose was to take a first look at the self-reported level of imagery vividness and determine the relative proportion of aphantasic/hyperphantasic participants in different age-groups. Relying on the frequently used Vividness of Visual Mental Imagery questionnaire, we collected data on a random sample of 2252 participants between the ages of 12 to 60 years. We found a novel developmental pattern describing a declining ability to elicit vivid visual mental images in the group averages of different age-groups from adolescence to middle age. This effect involves both a decreasing proportion of individuals with very vivid imagery and an increasing proportion of individuals with weak imagery as maturation (assessed by boneage estimations in adolescents) and aging progresses. This finding may help to shed light on yet unknown developmental mechanisms of our internal, stimulus-independent processes, and might also help to determine genetic, maturational, and age-dependent factors in the extreme cases of hyper- and aphantasia.</p>",2021-12-07

Black students received the least help from scientists and were most likely to be required to do science fair. They also were most likely to receive no help from parents, teachers, or scientists.

Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), a popular method to implement untargeted metabolomics, identifies metabolites via combined mass/charge (m/z) and retention time as mass features. Improvements in the sensitivity of mass spectrometers has increased the complexity of data produced, leading to computational obstacles. One outstanding challenge is calling metabolite mass feature peaks rapidly and accurately in large LC-MS datasets (dozens to thousands of samples) in the presence of measurement and other noise. While existing algorithms are useful, they have limitations that become pronounced at scale and lead to false positive metabolite predictions as well as signal dropouts. To overcome some of these shortcomings, biochemists have developed hybrid computational and carbon labeling techniques, such as credentialing. Credentialing can validate metabolite signals, but is laborious and its applicability is limited. We have developed a suite of three computational tools to overcome the challenges of unreliable algorithms and inefficient validation protocols: isolock, autoCredential and anovAlign. Isolock uses isopairs, or metabolite-istopologue pairs, to calculate and correct for mass drift noise across LC-MS runs. autoCredential leverages statistical features of LC-MS data to amplify naturally present 13C isotopologues and validate metabolites through isopairs. This obviates the need to artificially introduce carbon labeling. anovAlign, an anova-derived algorithm, is used to align retention time windows across samples to accurately delineate retention time windows for mass features. Using a large published clinical dataset as well as a plant dataset with biological replicates across time, genotype and treatment, we demonstrate that this suite of tools is more sensitive and reproducible than both an open source metabolomics pipelines, XCMS, and the commercial software progenesis QI. This software suite opens a new era for enhanced accuracy and increased throughput for untargeted metabolomics.</p>",2021-12-07

However, the reproductive ecology of social mole-rats in their natural environment remains poorly understood and it is unclear to what extent successful reproduction is dependent on assistance from other group members. Using data from a 7-year field study of marked individuals, we show that, after dispersal from their natal group, individuals typically settled alone in new burrow systems where they enjoyed high survival rates, and often remained in good body condition for several years before finding a mate. Unlike most other eusocial or singular cooperative breeders, we found that Damaraland mole-rats reproduced successfully in pairs without helpers and experimentally formed pairs had the same reproductive success as larger established groups. Overall there was only a weak increase in reproductive success with increasing group size and no effect of group size on adult survival rates across the population. Juveniles in large groups grew faster early in life but their growth rates declined subsequently so that they eventually plateaued at a lower maximum body mass than juveniles from small groups. Taken together, our data suggest that the fitness benefits of group living to breeders are small and we suggest that extended philopatry in Damaraland mole-rats has evolved because of the high costs and constraints of dispersal rather than because of strong indirect benefits accrued through cooperative behaviour.</p>",2021-12-10

Unlike typical miscibility transitions in which compact domains may coexist at equilibrium, the LAT condensates are dynamically arrested in extended states, kinetically trapped out of equilibrium. Modeling identifies the structural basis for this kinetic arrest as the formation of spindle arrangements, favored by limited multivalent binding interactions along the flexible, intrinsically disordered LAT protein.

As a result, variations in brain size may bias correlation estimates with the AI or group differences in AI. We investigated how to analyze brain asymmetries in to distinguish global from regional effects, and report unbiased group differences in cerebral asymmetries. We analyzed the extent to which the L+R Measure, Total Cerebral Measure (TCM, e.g., Total Brain Volume), and L-R TCM predict regional asymmetries. As a case study, we assessed the consequences of omitting each of these predictors on the magnitude and significance of sex differences in asymmetries. We found that the L+R Measure, the TCM, and the L-R TCM predicted the AI of more than 89% of regions and that their relationships were generally linear. Removing any of these predictors changed the significance of sex differences in 33% of regions and the magnitude of sex differences across 13-42% of regions. Although we generally report similar sex and age effects on cerebral asymmetries to those of previous large-scale studies, properly adjusting for regional and global brain size revealed additional sex and age effects on brain asymmetry.</p>",2021-12-10

However, the precise mechanisms responsible for the transport deficits and whether they preferentially affect α-motor neuron (MN) subtypes remain unresolved.

Nevertheless, much work remains to quantitatively account for cryptic local adaptation across studies. Among the most commonly documented forms of cryptic local adaptation are cogradient and countergradient variation, in which genetic variance for a phenotype either varies additively with or opposes the environmental variance, respectively, and where both mask the true genetic effect on phenotypes. Here, we estimated the genetic variance component of cryptic local adaption using a meta-analytical framework. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to first estimate the full genetic effect of co- and countergradient variation and then a metaregression to assess which abiotic or biotic covariates are the most important drivers of cryptic local adaptation. The overall effect size of countergradient variation was 1.03 and the effect size of cogradient variation was 0.9. We also found that the covariates with the largest mean effect sizes were temperature and gamete size, although there was substantial within and among study variance. Finally, we assessed the magnitude and direction of the compensatory genetic effect of countergradient variation, that is, how different trait values were for countergradient genotypes in their home environments, finding that over- and undercompensation occurred in 74.6% of cases analyzed. Our results demonstrate the large effect of both counter- and cogradient variation expressed in wild populations, as well as the ubiquity across abiotic and biotic covariates. These findings are indicative of the pervasiveness of cryptic local adaptation and highlight the importance of accounting for these effects in ecological studies designed to include measures of phenotypic variance.</p>",2021-12-06

Using pairwise drug potency and drug interaction metrics from in vitro experiments across multiple growth environments, we trained machine learning models to predict outcomes associated with higher-order combinations in the BALB/c relapsing mouse model, an important preclinical model for drug development.

To understand the design features of effective drug combinations, we reformulated classifiers as simple rulesets to reveal guiding principles of constructing combination therapies for both preclinical and clinical outcomes. One example ruleset is to include a drug pair that is synergistic in dormancy and another pair that is potent in a cholesterol-rich growth environment. These rulesets are predictive, intuitive, and practical, thus enabling rational construction of effective drug combinations based on in vitro pairwise drug synergies and potencies.

In this paper, we aim to comprehensively identify conserved genes related to fruiting body morphogenesis and distill novel functional hypotheses for functionally poorly characterized genes. As a result of this analysis, we report 921 conserved developmentally expressed gene families, only a few dozens of which have previously been reported in fruiting body development. Based on literature data, conserved expression patterns and functional annotations, we provide informed hypotheses on the potential role of these gene families in fruiting body development, yielding the most complete description of molecular processes in fruiting body morphogenesis to date. We discuss genes related to the initiation of fruiting, differentiation, growth, cell surface and cell wall, defense, transcriptional regulation as well as signal transduction. Based on these data we derive a general model of fruiting body development, which includes an early, proliferative phase that is mostly concerned with laying out the mushroom body plan (via cell division and differentiation), and a second phase of growth via cell expansion as well as meiotic events and sporulation.

This skin microbial community is susceptible to disruption through stressors associated with transport, handling and the environment of intensive practices, and this risks the propagation of disease-causing pathogens. In this study, we characterised the microbial assemblages found on tilapia skin — the most widely farmed finfish globally — and in the surrounding water of seven earthen aquaculture ponds from two pond systems in distinct geographic regions in Malawi.

Cld is highly specific for chlorite and aside from low hydrogen peroxide activity has no known alternative substrate. Here, we reasoned that because chlorite is an intermediate oxidation state of chlorine, Cld can be used as a biomarker for oxidized chlorine species in microorganisms and microbial habitats. Cld was abundant in metagenomes from soils and freshwater to water treatment systems. About 5% of bacterial and archaeal genera contain an organism encoding Cld in its genome, and within some genera Cld is nearly conserved. Cld has been subjected to extensive horizontal gene transfer, suggesting selection by chlorite is episodic yet strong. Cld was also used as a biomarker to predict genes related to chlorine redox chemistry. Genes found to have a genetic association with Cld include known genes for responding to reactive chlorine species and uncharacterized genes for transporters, regulatory elements, and putative oxidoreductases that present targets for future research. Cld was repeatedly co-located in genomes with genes for enzymes that can inadvertently reduce perchlorate (CIO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>) or chlorate (CIO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), confirming that in nature (per)chlorate reduction does not only occur in specialized anaerobic respiratory metabolisms. The presence of Cld in genomes of obligate aerobes without such enzymes suggested that chlorite, like hypochlorous acid (HOCl), might be formed by oxidative processes within natural habitats.

Consequently, incorporating reward associations with an extinction memory may be an effective strategy to persistently attenuate threat responses. Moreover, while there is considerable research on the short-term effects of extinction strategies in humans, the long-term effects of extinction are rarely considered. In a within-subjects fMRI study, we compared counterconditioning (a form of rewarded-extinction) to standard extinction, at recent (24 hours) and remote (~1 month) retrieval tests. Relative to standard extinction, counterconditioning diminished 24-hour relapse of arousal and threat expectancy, and reduced activity in brain regions associated with the appraisal and expression of threat (e.g., thalamus, insula, periaqueductal gray). The retrieval of reward-associated extinction memory was accompanied by functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral striatum, whereas the retrieval of standard-extinction memories was associated with connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). One-month later, the retrieval of both standard- and rewarded-extinction was associated with amygdala-vmPFC connectivity. However, only rewarded extinction created a stable memory trace in the vmPFC, identified through overlapping multivariate patterns of fMRI activity from extinction to 24-hour and 1-month retrieval. These findings provide new evidence that reward may generate a more stable and enduring memory trace of attenuated threat in humans.</p>",2021-12-10

We present a theoretical and experimental framework to measure autophagic steps in the form of rates under non-steady state conditions. We use this approach to measure temporal responses to rapamycin and wortmannin treatments, two commonly used autophagy modulators. We quantified changes in autophagy rates in as little as 10 minutes, which can establish direct mechanisms for autophagy perturbation before feedback begins. We identified concentration-dependent effects of rapamycin on the initial and temporal progression of autophagy rates.

We further demonstrate that microenvironmental and stress adaptive signals such as TGFβ2 and p38α/β, which induce DCC dormancy, upregulate macroH2A expression. Functionally, we find that overexpression of macroH2A variants is sufficient to induce tumor cells into dormancy and notably, inducible expression of the macroH2A2 variant suppresses the growth of DCCs into overt metastasis. However, this dormant state does not require well-characterized dormancy factors such as DEC2 and NR2F1, suggesting alternate pathways. Our transcriptomic analyses reveal that macroH2A2 overexpression inhibits E2F, RAS and MYC signaling programs, while upregulating inflammatory cytokines commonly secreted by senescent cells.

In a newly characterised condition called Vestibular Agnosia found in conditions with disrupted brain network connectivity, e.g. traumatic brain injury (TBI) or neurodegeneration (Parkinson’s Disease), the link between vestibular reflex and perception is uncoupled, such that, peripheral vestibular activation elicits a vestibular ocular reflex nystagmus but without vertigo. Using structural brain imaging in acute traumatic brain injury, we recently linked vestibular agnosia to postural imbalance via disrupted right temporal white-matter circuits (inferior longitudinal fasciculus), however no white-matter tracts were specifically linked to vestibular agnosia. Given the relative difficulty in localizing the neuroanatomical correlates of vestibular-motion perception, and compatible with current theories of human consciousness (viz. the Global Neuronal Workspace Theory), we postulate that vestibular-motion perception (vertigo) is mediated by the coordinated interplay between fronto-parietal circuits linked to whole-brain broadcasting of the vestibular signal of self-motion. We thus used resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) to map functional brain networks and hence test our postulate of an anterior-posterior cortical network mediating vestibular agnosia. Whole-brain rsfMRI was acquired from 39 prospectively recruited acute TBI patients (and 37 matched controls) with preserved peripheral and reflex vestibular function, along with self-motion perceptual thresholds during passive yaw rotations in the dark, and posturography. Following quality control of the brain imaging, 25 TBI patients’ images were analyzed. We classified 11 TBI patients with vestibular agnosia and 14 without vestibular agnosia based on laboratory testing of self-motion perception. Using independent component analysis, we found altered functional connectivity within posterior (right superior longitudinal fasciculus) and anterior networks (left rostral prefrontal cortex) in vestibular agnosia. Regions of interest analyses showed both inter-hemispheric and intra-hemispheric (left anterior-posterior) network disruption in vestibular agnosia. Assessing the brain regions linked via right inferior longitudinal fasciculus, a tract linked to vestibular agnosia in unbalanced patients (but now controlled for postural imbalance), seed-based analyses showed altered connectivity between higher order visual cortices involved in motion perception and mid-temporal regions. In conclusion, vestibular agnosia in our patient group is mediated by multiple brain network dysfunction, involving primarily left frontal and bilateral posterior networks. Understanding the brain mechanisms of vestibular agnosia provide both an insight into the physiological mechanisms of vestibular perception as well as an opportunity to diagnose and monitor vestibular cognitive deficits in brain disease such as TBI and neurodegeneration linked to imbalance and spatial disorientation.</p>",2021-12-07

Hypoxia, a hallmark of COVID-19 ARDS, was found to elicit a global metabolic reprogramming in effector lymphocytes.

However, little is known about the role of TDP-43 in HIV infection. In this work, we seek for the TDP-43 function on regulating CD4+ T cell permissibility to HIV infection. We observed that over-expression of wt-TDP-43 in CD4+ T cells stabilized HDAC6, increasing mRNA and the protein levels of this antiviral enzyme. Under this experimental condition, HIV-1 infection was impaired, independently of the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) complex tropism. The results obtained by using an HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-to-cell fusion model, under the same experimental conditions, suggest that the increase in TDP-43 levels negatively affects the viral Env fusion capacity. Moreover, the specific siRNA silencing of endogenous TDP-43 in target cells lead to a significant decrease in the levels of HDAC6 which consistently induces an increase in the fusogenic and infection activities of the HIV-1 Env. These observations were confirmed by using primary viral Envs from HIV+ individuals with different clinical phenotypes. An increase in the level of expression of wt-TDP-43 strongly reduced the Envs infection activity of viremic non-progressors (VNP) and rapid progressors (RP) HIV+ individuals down to the levels of the inefficient HIV-1 Envs from long-term non-progressor elite controllers (LTNP-EC) individuals. On the contrary, low levels of endogenous TDP-43, obtained after specific siRNA-TDP-43 knocking-down, significantly favors the infection activity of primary HIV-1 Envs of VNP and RP individuals, leading to an increase in the infection ability of the primary HIV-1/LTNP-EC Envs. Based on this evidence, we interpret that TDP-43 conditions cell permissibility to HIV infection by affecting viral Env fusion and infection capacities, at least by altering the cellular levels of the antiviral enzyme HDAC6.</p>",2021-12-07

However, as population is growing larger and its distribution is expanding wider, the risk of under-estimating population size using MDS is increasing sharply due to the rarely fulfilled assumption of perfect detection of all individuals of the population, and as a result, the need to report uncertainty in population size estimates becomes crucial. We addressed these issues within the framework of the monitoring of the critically endangered Pyrenean brown bear population that was on the edge of extinction in the mid-1990s with only five individuals remaining, but was reinforced by 11 bears originated from Slovenia since then. We used Pollock’s closed robust design (PCRD) capture-recapture models applied to the cross-border non-invasive sampling data from France, Spain and Andorra to provide the first published annual abundance estimates of the Pyrenean brown bear population and its trends over time. Annual population size increased and displayed a fivefold rise between 2008 and 2020, reaching &gt; 60 individuals in 2020. Detection heterogeneity among individuals may stem from intraspecific home range size disparities making it more likely to find signs of individuals who move more. We found a lower survival rate in cubs than in adults and subadults, since the formers suffer from more mortality risks (such as infanticides, predations, mother death or abandonments) than the latters. Our study provides evidence that the PCRD capture-recapture modelling approach can provide reliable estimates of the size of and trend in large mammal populations, while minimizing bias due to inter-individual heterogeneity in detection probabilities and allowing the quantification of sampling uncertainty surrounding these estimates. Such information is vital for informing management decision-making and assessing population conservation status.</p>",2021-12-09

Entry of coronaviruses into host cells is mediated by the viral spike (S) protein. Previously, we identified that the domain immediately downstream of the S2’ cleavage site is the <italic>bona fide</italic> FP (amino acids 798-835) for SARS-1 using ESR spectroscopy technology. We also found that the SARS-1 FP induces membrane ordering in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent fashion. In this study, we want to know which residues are involved in this Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding, to build a topological model and to understand the role of the Ca2+. We performed a systematic mutation study on the negatively charged residues on the SARS-1 FP. While all six negatively charged residues contributes to the membrane ordering activity of the FP to some extent, D812 is the most important residue. We provided a topological model of how the FP binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions: both FP1 and FP2 bind one Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion, and there are two binding sites in FP1 and three in FP2. We also found that the corresponding residue D830 in the SARS-2 FP plays a similar critical role. ITC experiments show that the binding energies between the FP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> as well as between the FP and membranes also decreases for all mutants. The binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the folding of FP and the ordering activity correlated very well across the mutants, suggesting that the function of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> is to help to folding of FP in membranes to enhance its activity. Using a novel pseudotyped virus particle (PP)-liposome methodology, we monitored the membrane ordering induced by the FPs in the whole S proteins in its trimer form in real time. We found that the SARS-1 and SARS-2 PPs also induce membrane ordering as the separate FPs do, and the mutations of the negatively charged residues also greatly reduce the membrane ordering activity. However, the difference in kinetic between the PP and FP indicates a possible role of FP trimerization. This finding could lead to therapeutic solutions that either target the FP-calcium interaction or block the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>",2021-12-06

Understanding how the tumor microenvironment evolves during disease progression is crucial to deciphering the mechanisms underlying the functional behavior of cancer cells. To adapt, cancer cells activate signaling and transcriptional programs and migrate to establish micro-niches, in response to signals from neighboring cells and non-cellular stromal factors. Using multiple tissue analysis approaches to identify and measure immune cell infiltration and extracellular matrix deposition in brain tumors, we show that low-grade glioma is largely devoid of infiltrating immune cells and extracellular matrix proteins, while high-grade glioma exhibits abundant immune cell infiltration and activation, as well as extensive collagen deposition. Spatial analysis shows that most T-cells are sequestered in perivascular nests, but macrophages penetrate deep into tumor cell rich regions. High-grade gliomas exhibit heterogeneous PI3K and MAPK signaling, which correlates with distinct pathological hallmarks, including tumor angiogenesis, tumor cell density and extracellular matrix deposition.

Ras-like small monomeric GTPases, such as Rap2, play a key role in regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics and cell adhesions. However, how Rap2 function, localization, and activation are regulated during cell migration is not fully understood. We previously identified the small GTPase Rab40b as a regulator of breast cancer cell migration. Rab40b contains a Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS) box, which facilitates binding to Cullin5, a known E3 Ubiquitin Ligase component responsible for protein ubiquitylation. In this study, we show that the Rab40b/Cullin5 complex ubiquitylates Rap2. Importantly, we demonstrate that ubiquitylation regulates Rap2 activation, as well as recycling of Rap2 from the endolysosomal compartment to the lamellipodia of migrating breast cancer cells.

Here we sequence the genomes of 25 sub-lines of Drosophila S2 cells and show that TE insertions provide abundant markers for the phylogenetic reconstruction of diverse sub-lines in a model animal cell culture system. Analysis of DNA copy number evolution across S2 sub-lines revealed dramatically different patterns of genome organization that support the overall evolutionary history reconstructed using TE insertions. Analysis of TE insertion site occupancy and ancestral states support a model of ongoing transposition dominated by episodic activity of a small number of retrotransposon families.

However, despite recent advances in the understanding of trade-offs for vegetative and physiological traits, little is known about plant reproductive economics and how they constrain plant life-history strategies and shape interactions with floral visitors. Here, we investigate plant reproductive trade-offs and how these drive interactions with floral visitors using a dataset of 17 reproductive traits for 1,506 plant species from 28 plant-pollinator studies across 18 countries. We tested whether a plant's reproductive strategy predicts its interactions with floral visitors and if the different reproductive traits predict the plant's role within the pollination network. We found that over half of all plant reproductive trait variation was explained by two independent axes that encompassed plant form and function. Specifically, the first axis indicated the presence of a trade-off between flower number and flower size, while the second axis indicated a pollinator dependency trade-off. Plant reproductive trade-offs helped explain partly the presence or absence of interactions with floral visitors, but not differences in visitation rate. However, we did find important differences in the interaction level among floral visitor guilds on the different axes of trait variation. Finally, we found that plant size and floral rewards were the most important traits in the understanding of the plant species network role. Our results highlight the importance of plant reproductive trade-offs in determining plant life-history strategies and plant-pollinator interactions in a global context.</p>",2021-12-10

Exposed individuals who were COVID-19 negative tended to drink more liquor than those who were positive, an average of about one drink per day.

However, the amount is low, averaging about 1 drink per day. Enlarged samples are needed to confirm these results. The finding that past history of alcohol use disorder does not increase likelihood of developing COVID-19 is important. It should be noted that the 34 individuals diagnosed with AUD at baseline had survived an average of 32 years in order to participate in the current interview suggesting they may be especially resilient to adverse health conditions. The finding that a single question designed to elicit the presence or absence of depressed mood either currently or in the past was not a risk factor for COVID-19 in contrast to report of a clinically significant past history of a depressive episode based on more extensive examination using DSM criteria is important.

Apicomplexan parasites such as Plasmodium and Toxoplasma replicate by forming daughter cells within an intact mother cell, creating additional challenges to ensuring fidelity of division. Critical to these parasites' infectivity is an intricate cytoskeleton structure called the apical complex. Before the daughter apical complex can be inserted into the plasma membrane, the maternal material must be turned over. We previously identified the kinase ERK7 as required for the maturation of the apical complex in Toxoplasma gondii. Here we define the Toxoplasma ERK7 interactome, and identify a putative E3 ligase, CSAR1, as the downstream effector responsible for the phenotype. Genetic disruption of CSAR1 fully suppresses loss of the apical complex upon ERK7 knockdown. Furthermore, we show that CSAR1 is normally responsible for turnover of maternal cytoskeleton during cytokinesis, and that its aberrant function is driven by a mislocalization from the parasite residual body to the maternal and daughter apical complexes. These data identify a protein homeostasis pathway critical for Toxoplasma replication and fitness and suggest an unappreciated role for the parasite residual body in compartmentalizing processes that threaten the fidelity of parasite development.</p>",2021-12-09

Here we characterize species’ two-dimensional temperature and precipitation niche space occupied (i.e., species niche envelope) as complex geometries and assess their evolution across a large vertebrate radiation (all Aves) using a model that captures heterogeneous evolutionary rates on time-calibrated phylogenies. We find that extant birds coevolved from warm, mesic climatic niches into colder and drier environments and responded to the K-Pg boundary with a dramatic increase in disparity. Contrary to expectations of subsiding rates of niche evolution as lineages diversify, our results show that overall rates have increased steadily, with some lineages experiencing exceptionally high evolutionary rates, associated with colonization of novel niche spaces, and others showing niche stasis.

Our analyses suggest that as compared to previous variants of concern, the Omicron variant has increased antibody escape <italic>breadth</italic> due to mutations in class 3 and 4 antibody epitopes as well as increased escape <italic>depth</italic> due to accumulated mutations in class 1 antibody epitopes. We note certain RBD mutations that might further enhance Omicron’s escape, and in particular advise careful surveillance of two subclades bearing R346S/K mutations. Further, AAI network analysis suggests that the function of certain therapeutic monoclonal antibodies may be disrupted by Omicron mutations as a result of the cumulative indirect perturbations to the epitope surface properties, despite point-mutation analyses suggesting these antibodies are tolerant of the set of Omicron mutations in isolation. Finally, for several Omicron mutations that do not appear to contribute meaningfully to antibody escape, we find evidence for a plausible role in enhanced transmissibility via disruption of RBD-down conformational stability at the RBD-RBD interface.</p>",2021-12-08

Alternatively, Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) is commonly expressed with higher titers, though it has lower sensitivity in serological assays. Here, we improve transient Spike expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We demonstrate that Spike titers increase significantly over the expression period, maximizing at 14 mg/L at day 7.

Hub regions were identified in stimulatory conditions, and they represented the most active islet regions. Moreover, calcium waves were found to be initiated in different subregions and the roles of initiators and hubs did not overlap.

Enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis are enriched at contacts and membrane lipid composition at contacts is distinct relative to surrounding membranes. How contacts are remodeled and the subsequent biological consequences of altered contacts such as perturbed lipid metabolism remains poorly understood. Here we show that the p97 AAA-ATPase and its ER-tethered ubiquitin-X domain adaptor 8 (UBXD8) regulate the prevalence of ER-mitochondria contacts. The p97-UBXD8 complex localizes to contacts and loss of this complex increases contacts in a manner that is dependent on p97 catalytic activity. Quantitative proteomics of purified contacts demonstrates alterations in proteins regulating lipid metabolism upon loss of UBXD8. Furthermore, lipidomics studies indicate significant changes in distinct lipid species in UBXD8 knockout cells. We show that loss of p97-UBXD8 results in perturbed contacts due to an increase in membrane lipid saturation via SREBP1 and the lipid desaturase SCD1. Aberrant contacts in p97-UBXD8 loss of function cells can be rescued by supplementation with unsaturated fatty acids or overexpression of SCD1. Perturbation of contacts and inherent lipid synthesis is emerging as a hallmark to a variety of human disorders such as neurodegeneration. Notably, we find that the SREBP1-SCD1 pathway is negatively impacted in the brains of mice with p97 mutations that cause neurodegeneration.

Occasionally, however, our fingers become unstable and snap into a hyper-extended posture. This is because multi-link mechanisms, like our fingers, can buckle under tip forces. Suppressing this instability is crucial for hand dexterity, but how the neuromuscular system does so is unknown. Here we show that finger stability is due to the stiffness from muscle contraction and likely not feedback control. We recorded maximal force application with the index finger and found that most buckling events lasted less than 50ms, too fast for sensorimotor feedback to act. However, a biomechanical model of the finger predicted that muscle-induced stiffness is also insufficient for stability at maximal force unless we add springs to stiffen the joints. We tested this prediction in 39 volunteers. Upon adding stiffness, maximal force increased by 34±3%, and muscle electromyography readings were 21±3% higher for the finger flexors (mean±standard error). Hence, people refrain from applying truly maximal force unless an external stabilizing stiffness allows their muscles to apply higher force without losing stability. Muscle recordings and mathematical modeling show that the splint offloads the demand for muscle co-contraction and this reduced co-contraction with the splint underlies the increase in force. But more stiffness is not always better. Stiff fingers would interfere the ability to passively adapt to complex object geometries and precisely regulate force. Thus, our results show how hand function arises from neurally tuned muscle stiffness that balances finger stability with compliance.</p>",2021-12-06

Instead, cells rely on replication stress signaling to survive during, and recover from, nucleotide imbalance during S phase. In fact, replication stress signaling is activated during unperturbed S phases and promotes nucleotide availability to support DNA replication.

Together, our results identify a novel mechanism by which nerves contribute to breast cancer migration and metastasis by inducing a shift in TNBC cell gene expression and support the rationale for disrupting neuron-cancer cell interactions to target metastasis.</p><sec><title>Significance</title><p>The presence of nerves in breast tumors has been associated with poor outcome.

Here, we developed a calibration study to directly examine how researcher trap choice affects observations made in insect biodiversity sampling. Sampling efficiency of four types of traps: pitfalls, yellow ramp traps, a novel jar ramp trap, and yellow sticky cards, were compared with respect to an array of biodiversity metrics associated with the arthropods they captured. We found that trapping efficiency and functional groups of arthropods (flying versus ground-crawling) varied by trap type. Pitfalls and jar ramp traps performed similarly for all biodiversity metrics measured, suggesting that jar ramp traps provide a more comparable measurement of ground-crawling arthropod communities to pitfall sampling than the yellow ramp traps and should be considered when pitfall sampling cannot be used. This study illustrates the implications for biodiversity sampling of arthropods in environments with physical constraints on trapping, and the importance of directly comparing adapted methods to established sampling protocol. Future biodiversity monitoring schemes should conduct calibration experiments to provide important information on performance and potential limitations of sampling methodology.</p>",2021-12-07

The existing frameworks for matching identifications between runs perform peak tracing and propagation based on similarity of precursor features using only a limited number of dimensions available in MS1 data. These approaches do not produce accompanying confidence estimates and hence cannot filter probable false positive identity transfers. We introduce an embedding based PIP that uses a higher dimensional representation of MS1 measurements that is optimized to capture peptide identities using deep neural networks. We developed a propagation framework that works entirely on MaxQuant results. Current PIP workflows typically perform propagation mainly using two feature dimensions, and rely on deterministic tolerances for identification transfer. Our framework overcomes both these limitations while additionally assigning probabilities to each transferred identity. The proposed embedding approach enables quantification of the empirical false discovery rate (FDR) for peptide identification, while also increasing depth of coverage through coembedding the runs from the experiment with experimental libraries.

Sterol profiling revealed that, in each line, the predominant ergostane-type sterol of wild-type cells was replaced by other sterol species. Broadly, two different profiles emerged among the resistant lines. Whole genome sequencing then showed that these distinct profiles were due either to mutations in the sterol methyl transferase (C24SMT) gene locus or the sterol C5 desaturase (C5DS) gene. In three lines an additional deletion of the miltefosine transporter was found. Differences in sensitivity to amphotericin B were apparent, depending on whether cells were grown in HOMEM, supplemented with foetal bovine serum, or a serum free defined medium (DM). These differences appeared to relate to the presence of lipids in the former. Metabolomic analysis after exposure to AmB showed that a large increase in glucose flux via the pentose phosphate pathway preceded cell death in cells sustained in HOMEM but not DM, indicating the oxidative stress was more significantly induced under HOMEM conditions.

Most available knowledge about this structure has been compiled into a detailed model [Billeh et al., 2020] for a generic cortical microcircuit in the primary visual cortex, consisting of 51,978 neurons of 111 different types. We add a noise model to the network that is based on experimental data, and analyze the results of network computations that can be extracted by projection neurons on layer 5. We show that the resulting model acquires through alignment of its synaptic weights via gradient descent training the capability to carry out a number of demanding visual processing tasks. Furthermore, this weight-alignment induces specific neural coding features in the microcircuit model that match those found in the living brain: High dimensional neural codes with an arguably close to optimal power-law decay of explained variance of PCA components, specific relations between signal- and noise-coding dimensions, and network dynamics in a critical regime. Hence these important features of neural coding and dynamics of cortical microcircuits in the brain are likely to emerge from aspects of their genetically encoded architecture that are captured by this data-based model in combination with learning processes. In addition, the model throws new light on the relation between visual processing capabilities and details of neural coding.</p>",2021-12-07

Vital mutations in the VOC are found in spike protein, particularly in the receptor binding domain (RBD), which directly interacts with ACE2 on the host cell membrane, a key determinant of the binding affinity and cell entry. With the reporting of the most recent VOC, omicron, we performed amino acid sequence alignment of the omicron spike protein with that of the wild type and other VOCs. Although it shares several conserved mutations with other variants, we found that omicron has a large number of unique mutations. We applied the Hopp-Woods scale to calculate the hydrophilicity scores of the amino acid stretches of the RBD and the entire spike protein, and found 3 new hydrophilic regions in the RBD of omicron, implying exposure to water, with the potential to bind proteins such as ACE2 increasing transmissibility and infectivity.  However, careful analysis reveals that most of the exposed domains of spike protein can serve as antigenic epitopes for generating B cell and T cell-mediated immune responses. This suggests that in the collection of polyclonal antibodies to various epitopes generated after multiple doses of vaccination, some can likely still bind to the omicron spike protein and the RBD to prevent severe clinical disease. In summary, while the omicron variant might result in more infectivity, it can still bind to a reasonable repertoire of antibodies generated by multiple doses of current vaccines likely preventing severe disease. Effective vaccines may not universally prevent opportunistic infections but can prevent the sequelae of severe disease, as observed for the delta variant. This might still be the case with the omicron variant, albeit, with increased frequency of infection.</p>",2021-12-09

Seventy world-leading bovine welfare experts based in 23 countries, were asked to evaluate the likelihood of a bovine to experience 12 states of potential welfare concern, inspired by the Welfare Quality® protocol.

This situation arises considering that the disaster can directly and indirectly affect the healthcare system’ s capacity to serve the COVID-19 cases. With severely damaged healthcare facilities due to the disaster, there will be severely ill COVID-19 cases unmanaged. The coupling and interplay between these two phenomena can indeed be catastrophic. One of the regions where this issue becomes concerned is in Southeast Asia, where most of the Asian countries lie in the fragile ring of fire ecosystem, contributing to the high tsunami and earthquake disasters in the world. At the same time, Asia is one of the regions that have been severely impacted due to the current COVID-19 Delta Variant. Recently, a more contagious Omicron Variant has emerged and put a more massive burden on the healthcare facilities that are impacted by disasters. Then, in this situation, this paper aims to assess healthcare resilience in managing the Omicron pandemic amid disaster impacts. SIR simulation was used to determine whether severely ill Omicron cases were below or above healthcare and ICU capacity under different vaccination coverage. Our result confirms that vaccination coverage was the imminent factor in reducing the severely ill cases in every healthcare facility, whether the facilities were damaged or not. Increasing vaccination coverage from 30% to 60% will significantly reduce the number of severely ill cases that fall below the capacity of healthcare. Based on the current SIR model on the Omicron epidemic variables and Ro, it is estimated that the Omicron will reach its peak after 180 days in February 2022 and will totally disappear in May 2022 in this modeled area. When healthcare system facilities were fully operational and no disaster happened, combined with 60% vaccination rates, all Omicron case numbers were below and under the available hospital beds and even available ICU beds. While the situation is changed when a disaster occurs and causes 30% damage or reduction to healthcare facilities. In this situation, there are portions of Omicron cases that cannot be managed by the healthcare system since the cases have exceeded the available beds. The situations become more apparent where the healthcare facilities are severely damaged and lose 60% of their functionality. In this situation, all modeled Omicron cases and even the severe cases have exceeded the ICU capacity.</p>",2021-12-07

Infection by the protozoan parasite results in the clinical syndrome trichomoniasis, which manifests as an inflammatory syndrome with acute and chronic consequences. Half or more of these parasites are themselves infected with one or more dsRNA viruses which can exacerbate the inflammatory disease. Four distinct viruses have been found in T. vaginalis to date, Trichomonas vaginalis virus 1 through 4 (or TVVs). Despite the global prevalence of these viruses, few coding-complete genome sequences have been determined. We conducted viral sequence mining in publicly available transcriptomes across 60 RNA-seq datasets representing 13 distinct T. vaginalis isolates. We assembled sequences for 27 new trichomonasvirus strains across all known TVV species, with 17 of these assemblies representing coding-complete genomes. Using a strategy of de novo sequence assembly followed by taxonomic classification, we discovered a fifth species of TVV that we term Trichomonas vaginalis virus 5 (TVV5). Six strains of TVV5 were assembled, including two coding-complete genomes. These TVV5 sequences exhibit high sequence identity to each other, but low identity to any strains of TVV1-4. Phylogenetic analysis corroborates the species-level designation. These results substantially increase the number of coding-complete TVV genome sequences and demonstrate the utility of mining publicly available transcriptomes for the discovery of RNA viruses in a critical human pathogen.</p>",2021-12-10

However, most of the work has focused on the microbiota of the upper respiratory tract (URT), hindering potential insights from the lower respiratory tract (LRT) that may help to understand the role of the microbiota in Influenza disease. In this work, we characterized the microbiota of the LRT of patients with Influenza A using 16S rRNA sequencing. We tested if patients with different outcomes (deceased/recovered), use of antibiotics, and different days of symptoms onset differ in their microbial community composition. We found striking differences in the diversity and composition of the microbiota depending on the days of symptoms onset and with mortality of the studied patients. We detected a high abundance of opportunistic pathogens such as <italic>Enterococcus, Granulicatella</italic>, and <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> in patients either deceased or with antibiotic treatment. Also, we found that antibiotic treatment deeply perturbs the microbial communities in the LRT and affect the probability of survival in Influenza A patients. Altogether, the loss of microbial diversity could, in turn, generate a disequilibrium in the community, potentially compromising the immune response increasing viral infectivity, promoting the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria that, together with altered biochemical parameters, can be leading to severe forms of the disease. Overall, the present study gives one of the first characterizations of the diversity and composition of microbial communities in the LRT of Influenza patients and its relationship with clinical variables and disease severity.</p>",2021-12-08

Our method, ReplicaDock 2.0, mimics induced-fit mechanism of protein binding to sample backbone motions across putative interface residues on-the-fly, thereby recapitulating binding-partner induced conformational changes. Furthermore, ReplicaDock 2.0 clocks in at 150-500 CPU hours per target (protein-size dependent); a runtime that is significantly faster than Molecular Dynamics based approaches. For a benchmark set of 88 proteins with moderate to high flexibility (unbound-to-bound iRMSD over 1.2 Angstroms), ReplicaDock 2.0 successfully docks 61% of moderately flexible complexes and 35% of highly flexible complexes. Additionally, we demonstrate that by biasing backbone sampling particularly towards residues comprising flexible loops or hinge domains, highly flexible targets can be predicted to under 2 angstrom accuracy.

The strongest IFN antagonist is the accessory protein ORF6, which localizes to multiple membranous compartments, including the nuclear envelope, where it directly binds the nuclear pore components Nup98-Rae1 to inhibit nuclear translocation of activated STAT1/IRF3 transcription factors. However, a direct cause-and-effect relationship between ORF6 localization and IFN antagonism has yet to be explored experimentally. Here, we use extensive mutagenesis studies to define the structural determinants required for steady-state localization and demonstrate that mis-localized ORF6 variants can still potently inhibit nuclear trafficking and IFN signaling. Additionally, expression of a peptide that mimics the ORF6/Nup98 interaction domain robustly inhibited nuclear trafficking. Furthermore, pharmacologic and mutational approaches combined to suggest that ORF6 is likely a peripheral-membrane protein, opposed to being a transmembrane protein as previously speculated.

Loss of MCM8 or 9 slows overall replication speed and increases markers of genomic damage and fork instability, further compounded upon treatment with hydroxyurea. MCM8/9 acts upstream and antagonizes the recruitment of BRCA1 in nontreated conditions. However, upon treatment with fork stalling agents, MCM9 recruits Rad51 to protect and remodel persistently stalled forks.

While it is known that CD4+ T cell proliferation relies on autophagy, direct identification of the autophagosomal cargo involved is still missing. Here, we created a transgenic mouse model, which, for the first time, enables us to directly map the proteinaceous content of autophagosomes in any primary cell by LC3 proximity labelling. IL-7Rα, a cytokine receptor mostly found in naive and memory T cells, was reproducibly detected in autophagosomes of activated CD4+ T cells. Consistently, CD4+ T cells lacking autophagy showed increased IL-7Rα surface expression, while no defect in internalisation was observed. Mechanistically, excessive surface IL-7Rα sequestrates the common gamma chain, impairing the IL-2R assembly and downstream signalling crucial for T cell proliferation. This study provides proof-of-principle that key autophagy substrates can be reliably identified with this model to help mechanistically unravel autophagy's contribution to healthy physiology and disease.</p>",2021-12-10

It is absorbed through the roots in the form of inorganic phosphate (Pi). To cope with Pi limitation, plants have evolved an array of adaptive mechanisms to facilitate Pi acquisition and protect them from stress caused by Pi starvation. The NITROGEN LIMITATION ADAPTION (NLA) gene plays a key role in the regulation of phosphate starvation responses (PSR), its expression being regulated by the microRNA miR827. Stress caused by Pi limiting conditions might also affect the plant response to pathogen infection. However, cross-talk between phosphate signaling pathways and immune responses remains unclear. 
Results: In this study, we investigated whether NLA plays a role in Arabidopsis immunity. We show that loss-of-function of NLA and MIR827 overexpression causes an increase in phosphate (Pi) content which results in resistance to infection by the fungal pathogen Plectosphaerella cucumerina. The nla mutant plants accumulated callose in their leaves, a response that is also observed in wild-type plants that have been treated with high Pi. We also show that pathogen infection and treatment with fungal elicitors is accompanied by transcriptional activation of MIR827 and down-regulation of NLA. Upon pathogen challenge, nla plants exhibited higher levels of the phytoalexin camalexin compared to wild type plants. Camalexin level also increases in wild type plants treated with high Pi. Furthermore, the nla mutant plants accumulated salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) in the absence of pathogen infection whose levels further increased upon pathogen. 
Conclusions: This study shows that NLA acts as a negative regulator of Arabidopsis immunity. Overaccumulation of Pi in nla plants positively affects resistance to infection by fungal pathogens. This piece of information reinforces the idea of signaling convergence between Pi and immune responses for the regulation of disease resistance in Arabidopsis.</p>",2021-12-10

Here we apply the approach to embryos. What are the first embryonic behaviors and how do they evolve as early neurodevelopment ensues? To address these questions, we present a systematic description of behavioral maturation for Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Posture libraries were derived from a genetically encoded motion capture suit imaged with light-sheet microscopy and annotated using custom semi-automated tracking software (Multiple Hypothesis Hypergraph Tracking; MHHT). Analysis of cell trajectories, postures, and behavioral motifs revealed a stereotyped developmental progression. Early movement is dominated by flipping between dorsal and ventral coiling, which gradually slows into a period of reduced motility. Late-stage embryos exhibit sinusoidal waves of dorsoventral bends, prolonged bouts of directed motion, and a rhythmic pattern of pausing, which we designate slow wave twitch (SWT). Synaptic transmission is required for late-stage motion but not for early flipping or the intervening inactive phase. A high-throughput behavioral assay and calcium imaging revealed that SWT is elicited by the rhythmic activity of a quiescence-promoting neuron (RIS).

Whether this codon usage bias (CUBias) reflects underlying neutral mutational processes or is instead shaped by selection remains an open debate, especially regarding the role of selection for enhanced protein production. Variation in CUBias of a gene (be it natural synonymous mutations or biotechnological synonymous recoding) can have an enormous impact on its expression by diverse cis- acting mechanisms. But expression of genes with extreme CUBias can also lead to strong phenotypic effects by altering the overall intracellular translation homeostasis via competition for ribosomal machinery or tRNA depletion. In this study, we expressed at high levels in human cells six different synonymous versions of a gene and used matched transcriptomic and proteomic data to evaluate the impact of CUBias of the heterologous gene on the translation of cellular transcripts. Our experimental design focused specifically on differences during translation elongation. Response to expression of the different synonymous sequences was assessed by various approaches, ranging from analyses performed on a per-gene basis to more integrated approaches of the cell as a whole. We observe that the transcriptome displayed substantial changes as a result of heterologous gene expression by triggering an intense antiviral and inflammatory response, but that changes in the proteomes were very modest. Most importantly we notice that changes in translation efficiency of cellular transcripts were not associated with the direction of the CUBias of the heterologous sequences, thereby providing only limited support for trans- acting effects of synonymous changes. We interpret that, in human cells in culture, changes in CUBias can lead to important cis- acting effects in gene expression, but that cellular homeostasis can buffer the phenotypic impact of overexpression of heterologous genes with extreme CUBias.</p>",2021-12-10

This apparent honest signalling in aposematism is predicted by resource competition models which assume that the production and maintenance of aposematic defences compete for access to antioxidant molecules that have dual functions as pigments directly responsible for colouration and in protecting against oxidative lipid damage. Here we study a model aposematic system - the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and make use of the variable phytochemistry of its larval host-plant, milkweeds (Asclepiadaceae), to manipulate the concentration of sequestered cardenolides. We test two fundamental assumptions of resource competition models: that (1) the possession of secondary defences is associated with costs in the form of oxidative lipid damage and reduced antioxidant defences; and (2) that oxidative damage or decreases in antioxidant defences can reduce the capacity of individuals to produce aposematic displays. Monarch caterpillars that sequestered the highest concentrations of cardenolides exhibited higher levels of oxidative lipid damage as adults. The relationship between warning signals, cardenolide concentrations and oxidative damage differed between the sexes. In male monarchs conspicuousness was explained by an interaction between oxidative damage and sequestration: as males sequester more cardenolides, those with high levels of oxidative damage become less conspicuous, while those that sequester lower levels of cardenolides equally invest in conspicuous with increasing oxidative damage. There was no significant effect of oxidative damage or concentration of sequestered cardenolides on female conspicuousness. Our results demonstrate physiological linkage between the production of coloration and protection from autotoxicity, that warning signals can be honest indicators of defensive capability, and that the relationships are different between the sexes.</p>",2021-12-10

Within the same pathogen species, virulence can vary considerably depending on strain or lineage, in turn eliciting variable host responses. One pathogen that has caused extensive biodiversity loss is the amphibian-killing fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which is comprised of a globally widespread hypervirulent lineage (Bd-GPL), and multiple geographically restricted lineages. Whereas host immunogenomic responses to Bd-GPL have been characterized in a number of amphibian species, immunogenomic responses to geographically-restricted, enzootic Bd lineages are unknown. To examine lineage-specific host immune responses to Bd, we exposed a species of pumpkin toadlet, Brachycephalus pitanga, which is endemic to Brazil's Southern Atlantic Forest, to either the Bd-GPL or the enzootic Bd-Asia-2/Brazil (hereafter Bd-Brazil) lineage. We quantified functional immunogenomic responses over the course of infection using differential gene expression tests and coexpression network analyses. Host immune responses varied significantly with Bd lineage. Toadlet responses to Bd-Brazil were weak at early infection (26 genes differentially expressed), peaked by mid-stage infection (435 genes) and were nearly fully resolved by late-stage disease (9 genes). In contrast, responses to Bd-GPL were magnified and delayed; toadlets differentially expressed 97 genes early, 86 genes at mid-stage infection, and 728 genes by late-stage infection. Given that infection intensity did not vary between mid- and late-stage disease, this suggests that pumpkin toadlets may be at least partially tolerant to the geographically-restricted Bd-Brazil lineage. In contrast, mortality was higher in Bd-GPL-infected toadlets, suggesting that late-stage immune activation against Bd-GPL was not protective and was consistent with immune dysregulation previously observed in other species. Our results demonstrate that both the timing of immune response and the particular immune pathways activated are specific to Bd lineage. Within regions where multiple Bd lineages co-occur, and given continued global Bd movement, these differential host responses may influence not only individual disease outcome, but transmission dynamics at the population and community levels.</p>",2021-12-10

Results: We show that treatment with high iron confers resistance to infection by the blast fungus <italic>M. oryzae</italic> in rice. Histochemical staining of <italic>M. oryzae</italic>-infected leaves revealed that iron and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) accumulate at high levels in cells in the vicinity of the infection site.

Notably, a superinduction of phytoalexin biosynthetic genes, both diterpene phytoalexins and sakuranetin, is observed in iron-treated plants during pathogen infection. As a consequence, phytoalexin accumulation was higher in iron-treated plants compared with control plants. Transcriptional alterations of iron homeostasis-related genes and a reduction in apoplastic iron content were observed in leaves of Fe-treated rice plants. 
Conclusions: These results illustrate that the iron status plays a key role in the response of rice plants to pathogen infection, while reinforcing the notion that iron signaling and defense signaling must operate in a coordinated manner in controlling disease resistance in plants.

We show by mass-spectrometry (MS) the CKD induced changes in rat parathyroid proteome and phosphoproteome profiles.

Accordingly, pharmacologic Pin1 inhibition increases PTH expression in parathyroid organ cultures and transfected cells, through the <italic>PTH</italic> mRNA protein binding <italic>cis</italic> element and KSRP phosphorylation. Therefore, CKD leads to parathyroid loss of Pin1 activity by inducing Pin1 phosphorylation. This predisposes parathyroids to increase PTH production through modified <italic>PTH</italic> mRNA-KSRP interaction that is dependent on KSRP phosphorylation.

Herein, we report a multiplexed microcoil array for localized activation of cortical neurons and retinal ganglion cells. We designed a computational model that related the activation function to the geometry and arrangement of coils, and selected a geometry with a region of activation &lt;50 μm wide. We then fabricated SU8/Cu/SU8 tri-layer devices which were flexible, transparent and conformal and featured four individually-addressable microcoil stimulation elements. Interfaced with ex vivo cortex or retina slices from GCaMP6-transfected mice, we observed that individual neurons located within 40 μm of the element tip could be activated repeatedly and in a dose (power) dependent fashion.

This triple network model suggests that SN causally controls DMN and CEN in healthy individuals. This interaction is often referred to as the dynamic controlling mechanism of SN. However, such interactions are not well understood in individuals with schizophrenia. In this study, we leveraged resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of schizophrenia (n = 67) and healthy controls (n = 81) to evaluate the functional interactions among DMN, SN, and CEN using dynamical causal modeling. In healthy controls, our analyses replicated previous findings that SN regulates DMN and CEN activities (Mann-Whitney U test; p &lt; 10<sup>−8</sup>).

We also observed an increase of PCNA and γH2AX expression in the lung of a COVID-19 patient by immunohistochemistry. In addition, the inhibition of PCNA translocation by PCNA I1 and Verdinexor led to a reduction of plaque formation in an in vitro assay.

Despite a latent period that can exceed one year, to date DFTD diagnosis requires visual identification of tumour lesions. To enable earlier diagnosis, which is essential for the implementation of effective conservation strategies, we analysed the extracellular vesicle (EV) proteome of 87 Tasmanian devil serum samples. The antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin-3 (CATH3) was enriched in serum EVs of both devils with clinical DFTD (87.9% sensitivity and 94.1% specificity) and devils with latent infection (i.e., collected while overtly healthy, but 3-6 months before subsequent DFTD diagnosis; 93.8% sensitivity and 94.1% specificity). As antimicrobial peptides can play a variety of roles in the cancer process, our results suggest that the specific elevation of serum EV-associated CATH3 may be mechanistically involved in DFTD pathogenesis. This EV-based approach to biomarker discovery is directly applicable to improving understanding and diagnosis of a broad range of diseases in other species, and these findings directly enhance the capacity of conservation strategies to ensure the viability of the imperilled Tasmanian devil population.</p>",2021-12-07

Stretch reflex sensitivity can vary continuously during movement and changes between movement and posture. While there have been many demonstrations of reflex modulation and investigations into the underlying mechanisms, there have been few attempts to provide simple, quantitative descriptions of the relationship between the volitional control and stretch reflex sensitivity throughout tasks that require the coordinated activity of several muscles. Here we develop such a description and use it to test the hypothesis that the modulation of stretch reflex sensitivity during movement can be explained by the balance of activity within the relevant agonist and antagonist muscles better than by the activity only in the muscle homonymous with the elicited reflex. We applied continuous pseudo-random perturbations of elbow angle as subjects completed approximately 500 movements in elbow flexion and extension. Measurements were averaged across the repeated movements to obtain continuous estimates of stretch reflex amplitude and background muscle activity. We also ran a control experiment on a subset of subjects performing postural tasks at muscle activity levels matched to those measured in the movement task. For both experiments, we assessed the relationship between background activity in the agonist and antagonist muscles controlling elbow movement and the stretch reflexes elicited in them. We found that modulation in the stretch reflexes during movement can be described by modulation of the background activity in the agonist and antagonist muscles, and that models incorporating agonists and antagonists are significantly better than those considering only the homonymous muscle. Increases in agonist muscle activity enhanced stretch reflex sensitivity whereas increases in antagonist activity suppressed reflex activity. Surprisingly, the magnitude of these effects was similar, suggesting a balance of control between agonists and antagonist that is very different than the dominance of sensitivity to agonist activity during postural tasks. This greater relative sensitivity to antagonist background activity during movement is due to a large decrease in sensitivity to homonymous muscle activity during movement rather than substantial changes in the influence of antagonist muscle activity.</p>",2021-12-07

We first identified all the individual VHH substitutions that increase binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and then screened highly focused combinatorial libraries to isolate engineered nanobodies with improved properties. The corresponding VHH-Fc molecules show high affinities for SARS-CoV-2 antigens from various emerging variants and SARS-CoV-1, block the interaction between ACE2 and RBD and neutralize the virus with high efficiency. Its rare specificity across sarbecovirus relies on its peculiar epitope outside the immunodominant regions.

We found that the heart rate increased when listening to the music pieces rated as emotionally high-touching in the high interoceptive sensitivity group only. Compared to the emotionally low-touching music, listening to the emotionally high-touching music was associated with higher insula activity.

Immunotherapies – principally immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies that restore endogenous antitumor T-cell immunity – offer the greatest promise for HNSCC treatment. Anti-PD-1 has been recently approved for first line treatment of recurrent and metastatic HNSCC; however less than 20% of patients show clinical benefit and durable responses. In addition, the clinical application of ICI has been limited by immune-related adverse events (irAEs) consequent to compromised peripheral immune tolerance. Although irAEs are often reversible, they can become severe, prompting premature therapy termination or becoming life-threatening. To address the irAEs inherent to systemic ICI therapy, we developed a novel, local delivery strategy based upon an array of soluble microneedles (MN). Using our recently reported syngeneic, tobacco-signature murine HNSCC model, we found that both systemic and local-MN anti-CTLA-4 therapy lead to &gt;90% tumor response, which is dependent on CD8 T cells and conventional dendritic cell type 1 (cDC1).

The assessment of genetic variation at hundreds or thousands of unlinked genetic loci forms a sound basis to address questions ranging from micro-to macro-evolutionary timescales, and is now possible thanks to advances in sequencing technology. Major difficulties are associated with i) the lack of genomic resources for many taxa, especially from tropical biodiversity hotspots, ii) scaling the numbers of individuals analyzed and loci sequenced, and iii) building tools for reproducible bioinformatic analyses of such datasets. To address these challenges, we developed a set of target capture probes for phylogenomic studies of the highly diverse, pantropically distributed and economically significant rosewoods (<italic>Dalbergia</italic> spp.), explored the performance of an overlapping probe set for target capture across the legume family (Fabaceae), and built a general-purpose bioinformatics pipeline.
