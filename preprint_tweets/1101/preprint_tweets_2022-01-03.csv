Sisonke 2 enrolled 227 310 HCW from the 8 November to the 17 December 2021. Enrolment commenced before the onset of the Omicron driven fourth wave in South Africa affording us an opportunity to evaluate early VE in preventing hospital admissions of a homologous boost of the Ad26.COV.2 vaccine given 6-9 months after the initial vaccination in HCW.
We estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine booster in 69 092 HCW as compared to unvaccinated individuals enrolled in the same managed care organization using a test negative design. We compared VE against COVID19 admission for omicron during the period 15 November to 20 December 2021. After adjusting for confounders, we observed that VE for hospitalisation increased over time since booster dose, from 63% (95%CI 31-81%); to 84% (95% CI 67-92%) and then 85% (95% CI: 54-95%), 0-13 days, 14-27 days, and 1-2 months post-boost.
We provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of a homologous Ad26.COV.2 vaccine boost given 6-9 months after the initial single vaccination series during a period of omicron variant circulation. This data is important given the increased reliance on the Ad26.COV.2 vaccine in Africa.</p>",2021-12-29

Knowing which viruses are primed for zoonotic transmission can focus surveillance efforts and mitigation strategies for future pandemics. Successful engagement of receptor protein orthologs is necessary during cross-species transmission. The clade 1 sarbecoviruses including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter cells via engagement of ACE2, while the receptor for clade 2 and clade 3 remains largely uncharacterized. We developed a mixed cell pseudotyped virus infection assay to determine whether various clade 2 and 3 sarbecovirus spike proteins can enter HEK 293T cells expressing human or Rhinolophus horseshoe bat ACE2 proteins. The receptor binding domains from BtKY72 and Khosta-2 used human ACE2 for entry, while BtKY72 and Khosta-1 exhibited widespread use of diverse rhinolophid ACE2s. A lysine at ACE2 position 31 appeared to be a major determinant of the inability of these RBDs to use a certain ACE2 sequence. The ACE2 protein from R. alcyone engaged all known clade 3 and clade 1 receptor binding domains. We observed little use of Rhinolophus ACE2 orthologs by the clade 2 viruses, supporting the likely use of a separate, unknown receptor. Our results suggest that clade 3 sarbecoviruses from Africa and Europe use Rhinolophus ACE2 for entry, and their spike proteins appear primed to contribute to zoonosis under the right conditions.</p>",2021-12-27

This likely reflects different, lineage-specific selective pressures in their evolutionary histories, but how specific molecular features of regenerative programs help solve species-specific challenges has not been examined in detail.  Here we discover that, in the highly-regenerative axolotl salamander, a conserved, body-wide stem cell activation response triggered in response to limb removal primes undisturbed limbs for regeneration upon subsequent amputation. This response should be particularly useful to salamanders, which frequently lose limbs in response to cannibalism. We further demonstrate the body-wide response requires both peripheral nervous system input at these distant sites and mTOR signaling. We defined gene expression changes within the nerves and nearby tissues, harboring responsive stem cells, leading to identification of candidate genetic pathways influencing distant stem cell activation following amputation. Functional experimentation confirmed a requirement for adrenergic signaling in amputation-induced activation of distant stem cells. These findings reveal a direct link between systemic cellular activation responses to local tissue damage and overall regenerative ability. Similar systemic activation responses to tissue removal have been observed in animals with widely differing regenerative abilities (e.g., planaria to mice), suggesting that it is the responses downstream of these signals, likely sculpted by differing evolutionary pressures, that ultimately distinguish regenerators from non-regenerators.</p>",2021-12-30

Lake'}, {'name': 'Zachary W. D. Matson'}, {'name': 'Jack P. Dodson'}, {'name': 'Richard E. Lenski'}]","<p>Population bottlenecks are common in nature, and they can impact the rate of adaptation in evolving populations. On the one hand, each bottleneck reduces the genetic variation that fuels adaptation. On the other hand, fewer founders can undergo more generations and leave more descendants in a resource-limited environment, which allows surviving beneficial mutations to spread more quickly. Here we investigate the impact of repeated bottlenecks on the dynamics of adaptation in experimental populations of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. We propagated 48 populations under four dilution regimes (2-, 8-, 100-, and 1000-fold), all reaching the same final size each day, for 150 days. A simple model in which adaptation is limited by the supply rate of beneficial mutations predicts that fitness gains should be maximized with ~8-fold dilutions. The model also assumes that selection acts only on the overall growth rate and is otherwise identical across dilution regimes. However, we found that selection in the 2-fold regime was qualitatively different from the other treatments. Moreover, we observed earlier and greater fitness gains in the populations subjected to 100- and 1000-fold dilutions than in those that evolved in the 8 fold regime. We also ran simulations using parameters estimated independently from a long-term experiment using the same ancestral strain and environment. The simulations produced dynamics similar to our empirical results under these regimes, and they indicate that the simple model fails owing to the assumption that the supply of beneficial mutations limits adaptation.</p>",2021-12-30

Among the DNA computing primitives used today, DNA strand displacement (DSD) is arguably the most popular, with DSD-based circuit applications ranging from disease diagnostics to molecular artificial neural networks. The outputs of DSD circuits are generally read using fluorescence spectroscopy. However, due to the spectral overlap of typical small-molecule fluorescent reporters, the number of unique outputs that can be detected in parallel is limited, requiring complex optical setups or spatial isolation of reactions to make output bandwidths scalable. Here, we present a multiplexable sequencing-free readout method that enables real-time, kinetic measurement of DSD circuit activity through highly parallel, direct detection of barcoded output strands using nanopore sensor array technology (Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION device). We show that engineered reporter probes can be detected and classified with high accuracy at the single-molecule level directly from raw nanopore signals using deep learning. We then demonstrate this method's utility in multiplexed detection of clinically relevant microRNA sequences. These results increase DSD output bandwidth by an order of magnitude over what is possible with fluorescence spectroscopy, laying the foundations for a new paradigm in DNA circuit readout and programmable multiplexed molecular diagnostics using portable nanopore devices.</p>",2021-12-30

While significant advances have been made in the ability to sample action potentials of large numbers of individual neurons in animal models, translation of these methodologies to humans has been lacking due to clinical time constraints, electrical noise in the operating room, and reliability of the methodology. Here we present a reliable method for intraoperative recording of dozens of neurons in humans using the Neuropixels probe, yielding up to ~100 simultaneously-recorded single-units (n=596 across 11 recordings in 8 participants). Most single-units were active within 1 minute of reaching target depth, compatible with clinical time constraints. Cell pairs active close in time were spatially closer in most recordings, demonstrating the power to resolve complex cortical dynamics. Altogether, this approach provides access to population single-unit activity across the depth of human neocortex at scales previously only accessible in animal models.</p>",2021-12-30

Advances in deep learning-based object recognition enables the automated processing of large amounts of data, resulting in high accuracy through averaging. However, while the analysis of highly symmetric structures of constant size allows for a resolution approaching the dimensions of structural biology, deep learning methods are prone to different forms of bias. A biased recognition of structures may prohibit the development of readouts for processes that involve significant changes in size or shape of amorphous macromolecular complexes. What is required to overcome this problem is a detailed investigation of potential sources of bias and the rigorous testing of trained models using real or simulated data covering a wide dynamic range of possible results. Here we combine single molecule localization-based superresolution microscopy of septin ring structures with the training of several different deep learning models for a quantitative investigation of bias resulting from different training approaches and finally quantitative changes in septin ring structures. We find that trade-off exists between measurement accuracy and the dynamic range of recognized phenotypes. Using our trained models, we furthermore find that septin ring size can be explained by the number of subunits they are assembled from alone. Our work provides a new experimental system for the investigation of septin polymerization.</p>",2021-12-29

Conversely, various exogenous nutritional and pharmaceutical compounds affect the gut microbiome composition before entering circulation. Characterization of the gut microbiota—host plasma metabolite interactions is an important step towards understanding the effects of the gut microbiota on human health. However, studies involving large and deeply phenotyped cohorts that would reveal such meaningful interactions are scarce. Here, we used deep metagenomic sequencing and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography linked to mass spectrometry for detailed characterization of the fecal microbiota and plasma metabolome, respectively, of 8,584 participants invited at age 50 to 64 of the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS). After adjusting for multiple comparisons, we identified 1,008 associations between species alpha diversity and plasma metabolites, and 318,944 associations between specific gut metagenomic species and plasma metabolites. The gut microbiota explained up to 50% of the variance of individual plasma metabolites (mean of 4.7%). We present all results as the searchable association atlas ""GUTSY"" as a rich resource for mining associations, and exemplify the potential of the atlas by presenting novel associations between oral medication and the gut microbiome, and microbiota species strongly associated with levels of the uremic toxin p-cresol sulfate.

CNS fibroblasts have been characterized using transcriptional profiling and a Col1a1-GFP mouse line used to identify CNS fibroblasts in vivo. However, current methods for visualizing CNS fibroblasts are lacking and, in particular, prevent adequate assessment of fibroblast-vessel interactions. Here, we describe methods for whole mount visualization of meningeal and choroid plexus fibroblasts, and optical tissue clearing methods for visualization of parenchymal vessel-associated fibroblasts. Importantly, these techniques can be combined with immunohistochemistry methods for labeling different cell types in the meninges and blood vasculature as well as EdU-based cell proliferation assays. These methods are ideal for visualization of vessel-fibroblast interactions in these CNS structures and provide significant improvement over traditional sectioning and staining methods.

In contrast to single-cell approaches, however, the majority of single-nuclei RNA counts originate from partially processed RNA leading to intronic cDNAs, thus hindering the investigation of complete isoforms. Here, using microfluidics, PCR-based artifact removal, target enrichment, and long-read sequencing, we developed single-nuclei isoform RNA-sequencing ('SnISOr-Seq'), and applied it to the analysis of human adult frontal cortex samples. We found that exons associated with autism exhibit coordinated and more cell-type specific inclusion than exons associated with schizophrenia or ALS. We discovered two distinct modes of combination patterns: first, those distinguishing cell types in the human brain. These are enriched in combinations of TSS-exon, exon-polyA site, and distant (non-adjacent) exon pairs. Second, those with all isoform combinations found within one neural cell type, which are enriched in adjacent exon pairs. Furthermore, adjacent exon pairs are predominantly mutually associated, while distant pairs are frequently mutually exclusive. Finally, we observed that human-specific exons are as tightly coordinated as conserved exons, pointing to an efficient evolutionary mechanism underpinning coordination. SnISOr-Seq opens the door to single-nuclei long-read isoform analysis in the human brain, and in any frozen, archived or hard-to-dissociate sample.</p>",2021-12-30

Andrew Frank'}]","<p>To identify conserved components of synapse function that are also associated with human diseases, we conducted a genetic screen. We used the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model. We employed RNA interference (RNAi) on selected targets and assayed synapse function by electrophysiology. We focused our screen on genetic factors known to be conserved from human neurological or muscle functions (321 total RNAi lines screened). Knockdown of a particular Mitochondrial Complex I (MCI) subunit gene (ND-20L) lowered levels of NMJ neurotransmission. Due to the severity of the phenotype, we studied MCI function further. Knockdown of core MCI subunits concurrently in neurons and muscle led to impaired neurotransmission. Further, pharmacology targeting MCI phenocopied the impaired neurotransmission phenotype. Finally, MCI subunit knockdowns led to profound cytological defects, including reduced NMJ growth and altered NMJ morphology. Mitochondria are essential for cellular bioenergetics and produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Five multi-protein complexes achieve this task, and MCI is the largest. Impaired Mitochondrial Complex I subunits in humans are associated with disorders such as Parkinsons disease, Leigh syndrome, and cardiomyopathy. Together, our data present an analysis of Complex I in the context of synapse function and plasticity. We speculate that in the context of human MCI dysfunction, similar neuronal and synaptic defects could contribute to pathogenesis.</p>",2022-01-01

We demonstrate our workflow for various applications, from simple to complex gene circuits and metabolic networks, including several cell-free transcription and translation systems, a <italic>LacI</italic>-based multi-level controller and a 27-variable synthetic CO<sub>2</sub>-fixation cycle (CETCH cycle). Using METIS, we could improve above systems between one and two orders of magnitude compared to their original setup with minimal experimental efforts.

Beyond optimization, our workflow also quantifies the relative importance of individual factors to the performance of a system.

Using pseudoparticles expressing the spike of several SARS-CoV-2 variants, we evaluated the magnitude and breadth of the neutralizing antibody response over time in naturally infected and in mRNA-vaccinated individuals. We observed that while boosting increases the magnitude of the antibody response to wildtype (D614), Beta, Delta and Omicron variants, the Omicron variant was the most resistant to neutralization. We further observed that vaccinated healthy adults had robust and broad antibody responses while responses were relatively reduced in vaccinated pregnant women, underscoring the importance of learning how to maximize mRNA vaccine responses in pregnant populations.

These data argue that alternative immune mechanisms, beyond neutralization, may continue to confer protection against severe disease. Beyond their ability to bind and block infection, antibodies contribute to control and clearance of multiple infections via their ability to direct antiviral immunity via Fc-effector mechanisms. Thus, here we probed the ability of vaccine induced antibodies, across three COVID-19 vaccines, to drive Fc-effector activity against Omicron. Despite the significant loss of IgM, IgA and IgG binding to the Omicron Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) across BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and CoronaVac vaccines, stable isotype binding was observed across all of these vaccines to the Omicron Spike. Compromised RBD binding IgG was accompanied by a significant loss of cross RBD-specific antibody Fcγ-receptor binding by the CoronaVac vaccine, but preservation of RBD-specific FcγR2a and Fcγ3a binding across the mRNA vaccines. Conversely, Spike-specific antibodies exhibited persistent binding to Fcγ-receptors, across all three vaccines, albeit higher binding was observed with the mRNA vaccines, marked by a selective preservation of FcγR2a and Fcγ3a binding antibodies. Thus, despite the significant to near complete loss of Omicron neutralization across several vaccine platforms against Omicron, vaccine induced Spike-specific antibodies continue to recognize the virus and recruit Fc-receptors pointing to a persistent capacity for extra-neutralizing antibodies to contribute Omicron disease attenuation.</p>",2021-12-27

Manual lateralization patterns in non-human primates have the potential to elucidate evolutionary determinants of human handedness. However, restricted species samples and inconsistent methodologies are limiting comparative phylogenetic studies. By combining original data with published literature reports, we assembled data on hand preferences for standardized object manipulation in 1,806 individuals from 38 species of anthropoid primates, including monkeys, apes, and humans. Based on that, we employ quantitative phylogenetic methods to test prevalent hypotheses on the roles of ecology, brain size and tool use in primate handedness evolution. We confirm that human right-handedness represents an unparalleled extreme among anthropoids and found taxa displaying significant population-level handedness to be notably rare. Species-level direction of manual lateralization was largely uniform among non-human primates and neither correlated with phylogeny nor with any of the selected biological predictors. In contrast, we recovered highly variable patterns of hand preference strength, which show signatures of both ecology and phylogeny. In particular, terrestrial primates tend to display weaker hand preferences than arboreal species. These results challenge popular ideas on primate handedness evolution, especially the postural origins hypothesis. Furthermore, they point to a potential adaptive benefit of disparate lateralization strength in primates, a measure of hand preference that has often been overlooked in the past. Finally, our data show that human lateralization patterns do not align with trends found among other anthropoids, suggesting that unique selective pressures gave rise to the unusual hand preferences displayed by our species.</p>",2021-12-30

Methods: The musculoskeletal model was developed by adapting and expanding upon existing musculoskeletal models. An optimal control theory framework that combines forward-dynamics simulations with a simulated-annealing optimization was used to simulate maximum grip and pinch force. Active and passive hand opening were simulated to evaluate coordinated kinematic hand movements. Results: The model's maximum grip force production matched experimental measures of grip force, force distribution amongst the digits, and displayed sensitivity to wrist flexion. Simulated lateral pinch strength fell within variability of in vivo palmar pinch strength data. Additionally, predicted activation for 7 of 8 muscles fell within variability of EMG data during palmar pinch. The active and passive hand opening simulations predicted reasonable activations and demonstrated passive motion mimicking tenodesis, respectively. Conclusion: This work advances simulation capabilities of hand and wrist models and provides a foundation for future work to build upon. Significance: This is the first open-source musculoskeletal model of the hand and wrist to be implemented during both functional kinetic and kinematic tasks. We provide a novel simulation framework to predict maximal grip and pinch force which can be used to evaluate how potential surgical and rehabilitation interventions influence these functional outcomes while requiring minimal experimental data.</p>",2021-12-28

Previous studies identified multiple components of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex as selectively enriched in CA2, however the functional significance of this enrichment remains unclear. The MCU complex regulates calcium entry into mitochondria, which in turn regulates mitochondrial transport and localization to active synapses. We found that MCU is strikingly enriched in CA2 distal apical dendrites, precisely where CA2 neurons receive entorhinal cortical input carrying social information. Further, MCU-enriched mitochondria in CA2 distal dendrites are larger compared to mitochondria in CA2 proximal apical dendrites and neighboring CA1 apical dendrites. Genetic knockdown of MCU in CA2 resulted in smaller mitochondria in CA2 distal dendrites, indicating that MCU expression plays a role in regulating mitochondrial mass in CA2. MCU overexpression in neighboring CA1 led to larger mitochondria preferentially in proximal dendrites compared to distal dendrites and GFP controls. Our findings demonstrate that mitochondria are molecularly and structurally diverse across hippocampal cell types and circuits, and that MCU expression cell-autonomously regulates mitochondrial mass, but layer-specific dendritic localization depends on cell type. Our data support the idea that CA2 mitochondria are functionally distinct from CA1 mitochondria, which may confer unique synaptic and circuit properties underlying CA2 function in social memory.</p>",2021-12-28

Key to this pathogenic behavior is the production and signaling activity of a secreted pheromone, the autoinducing peptide (AIP), generated following the ribosomal synthesis and post-translational modification of a precursor polypeptide, AgrD, through two discrete cleavage steps. The integral membrane protease AgrB is known to catalyze the first processing event, generating the AIP biosynthetic intermediate, AgrD (1-32) thiolactone. However, the identity of the second protease in this biosynthetic pathway, which removes an N-terminal leader sequence, has remained ambiguous. Here, we show that MroQ, an integral membrane protease recently implicated in the agr response, is directly involved in AIP production. Genetic complementation and biochemical experiments reveal that MroQ proteolytic activity is required for AIP biosynthesis in agr specifiy groups -I and -II, but not group-III. Notably, as part of this effort, the biosynthesis and AIP-sensing arms of the QS circuit were reconstituted together in vitro. Our experiments also reveal the molecular features guiding MroQ cleavage activity, a critical factor in defining agr specificity group identity.

Most iRBD patients develop dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, or multiple system atrophy over time. Patients with iRBD exhibit brain atrophy patterns that are reminiscent of those observed in overt synucleinopathies. However, the mechanisms linking brain atrophy to the underlying alpha-synuclein pathophysiology are poorly understood. Our objective was to investigate how the prion-like and regional vulnerability hypotheses of alpha-synuclein might explain brain atrophy in iRBD.

Using a multicentric cohort of 182 polysomnography-confirmed iRBD patients who underwent T1-weighted MRI, we performed vertex-based cortical surface and deformation-based morphometry analyses to quantify brain atrophy in patients (67.8 years, 84% men) and 261 healthy controls (66.2 years, 75%) and investigated the morphological correlates of motor and cognitive functioning in iRBD. Next, we applied the agent-based Susceptible-Infected-Removed model (i.e., a computational model that simulates in silico the spread of pathologic alpha-synuclein based on structural connectivity and gene expression) and tested if it recreated atrophy in iRBD by statistically comparing simulated regional brain atrophy to the atrophy observed in patients. The impact of SNCA and GBA gene expression and brain connectivity was then evaluated by comparing the model fit to the one obtained in null models where either gene expression or connectivity was randomized.

The results showed that iRBD patients present with cortical thinning and tissue deformation, which correlated with motor and cognitive functioning. Next, we found that the atrophy simulated based on brain connectivity and gene expression recreated cortical thinning (r=0.51, p=0.0007) and tissue deformation (r=0.52, p=0.0005) in patients, and that the connectome's architecture along with SNCA and GBA gene expression contributed to shaping atrophy in iRBD. We further demonstrated that the full agent-based model performed better than network measures or gene expression alone in recreating the atrophy pattern in iRBD.

In summary, atrophy in iRBD is extensive, correlates with motor and cognitive functioning, and can be recreated using the dynamics of agent-based modelling, structural connectivity, and gene expression. These findings support the concepts that both prion-like spread and regional susceptibility account for the atrophy observed in prodromal synucleinopathies. Therefore, the agent-based Susceptible-Infected-Removed model may be a useful tool for testing hypotheses underlying neurodegenerative diseases and new therapies aimed at slowing or stopping the spread of alpha-synuclein pathology.</p>",2021-12-30

Here, we took advantage of the temporal and spatial specificity of an optogenetic manipulation to examine the role of the cornu ammonis 3 subregion of the DH (dCA3) in early-stage cocaine-memory reconsolidation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats expressing eNpHR3.0 in the DH were trained to self-administer cocaine in a distinct context and underwent extinction training in a different context. Rats then received a 15-min memory-reactivation session, to destabilize cocaine memories and trigger reconsolidation, or remained in their home cages (no-reactivation controls). Optogenetic inhibition of the dCA3 for 1 h immediately, but not 1 h, after memory reactivation resulted in cocaine-memory impairment as indicated by reduction in drug-seeking behavior selectively in the cocaine-paired context 3 d later, at test, relative to responding in no-inhibition, no-reactivation, and no-eNpHR3.0 controls. Cocaine-memory impairment was associated with reduced c-Fos expression, an index of neuronal activation, in the dCA3 stratum lucidum (SL) and stratum pyramidale (SP) at test. Based on these observations and extant literature, we postulate that recurrent circuits in the SP are activated during early-stage memory reconsolidation to maintain labile cocaine memories prior to protein synthesis-dependent restabilization in another brain region, such as the basolateral amygdala.

Vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe disease and death from COVID-19, and new medications that can reduce severity of disease have been approved. However, many countries are facing limited supply of vaccine doses and medications. A model estimating the probabilities for hospitalization and mortality according to individual risk factors and vaccine doses received could help prioritize vaccination and yet scarce medications to maximize lives saved and reduce the burden on hospitalization facilities.
Methods
Electronic health records from 101,034 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, since the beginning of the pandemic and until November 30, 2021 were extracted from a national healthcare organization in Israel. Logistic regression models were built to estimate the risk for subsequent hospitalization and death based on the number of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine doses received and few major risk factors (age, sex, body mass index, hemoglobin A1C, kidney function, and presence of hypertension, pulmonary disease or malignancy).
Results
The models built predict the outcome of newly infected individuals with remarkable accuracy: area under the curve was 0.889 for predicting hospitalization, and 0.967 for predicting mortality. Even when a breakthrough infection occurs, having received three vaccination doses significantly reduces the risk of hospitalization by 66% (OR=0.336) and of death by 78% (OR=0.220).
Conclusions
The models enable rapid identification of individuals at high risk for hospitalization and death when infected. These patients can be prioritized to receive booster vaccination and the yet scarce medications.

The B.1.1.529 Omicron variant is rapidly emerging and has been designated a Variant of Concern (VOC). The variant is highly transmissible and partially or fully evades a spectrum of neutralising antibodies due to a high number of substitutions in the spike glycoprotein. A major question is the relative severity of disease caused by the Omicron variant compared with previous and currently circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2. To address this, a mouse model of infection that recapitulates severe disease in humans, K18-hACE2 mice, were infected with either a Pango B, Delta or Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 and their relative pathogenesis compared. In contrast to mice infected with Pango B and Delta variant viruses, those infected with the Omicron variant had less severe clinical signs (weight loss), showed recovery and had a lower virus load in both the lower and upper respiratory tract. This is also reflected by less extensive inflammatory processes in the lungs. Although T cell epitopes may be conserved, the antigenic diversity of Omicron from previous variants would suggest that a change in vaccine may be required to mitigate against the higher transmissibility and global disease burden. However, the lead time to develop such a response may be too late to mitigate the spread and effects of Omicron. These animal model data suggest the clinical consequences of infection with the Omicron variant may be less severe but the higher transmissibility could still place huge burden upon healthcare systems even if a lower proportion of infected patients are hospitalised.</p>",2021-12-28

Our results showed the lower entry efficiency and less cleavage ability of Omicron than D614G variant. Pseudotype-based neutralizing assay was performed to analyze neutralizing antibodies elicited by previously infection or the RBD-based protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 against the Omicron variant.

Geometric mean titers (GMTs, 50% inhibitory dose [ID50]) of these sera against Omicron were 9.4-fold lower than against D614G.

To uncover mechanisms by which thermogenic adipose tissue is generated and maintained we developed a species-hybrid model in which human mesenchymal progenitor cells are induced in vitro to differentiate into white or thermogenic adipocytes and are then implanted into immuno-compromised mice. Upon implantation, thermogenic adipocytes form a more densely vascularized and innervated adipose tissue compared to non-thermogenic adipocytes. Mouse endothelial and stem/progenitor cells recruited by implanted human thermogenic adipocytes are also qualitatively different, with differentially expressed genes mapping predominantly to circadian rhythm pathways. We trace the formation of this enhanced neurovascular architecture to higher expression of a distinct set of genes directly associated with neurogenesis (THBS4, TNC, NTRK3 and SPARCL1), and to lower expression of genes associated with neurotransmitter degradation (MAOA, ACHE) by adipocytes in the developed tissue. Further analysis reveals that MAOA is abundant in human adipocytes but absent in mouse adipocytes, revealing species-specific mechanisms of neurotransmitter tone regulation. In summary, our work discovers specific neurogenic genes associated with development and maintenance of human thermogenic adipose tissue,  reveals species-specific mechanisms of control of neurotransmitter tone, and suggests that targeting adipocyte MAOA may be a strategy for enhancing thermogenic adipose tissue activity in humans.</p>",2021-12-30

In the dentate gyrus, a hippocampal input region that expresses uniquely high levels of BDNF, repetitive activation of mossy cells (MCs) induces a presynaptic, BDNF/TrkB-dependent form of LTP at MC to granule cell (GC) synapses. Here, we report that activity-induced BDNF release from MC axons in mice elicits postsynaptic BDNF release in a TrkB- and calcium-dependent manner, and that BDNF-induced BDNF release is essential for LTP induction. Suppression of BDNF release by tonic and phasic activity of presynaptic type-1 cannabinoid receptors dampened LTP, revealing an unprecedented role of these receptors in controlling neuropeptide release. Lastly, BDNF-mediated MC-GC LTP can be elicited in vivo. Thus, BDNF-induced BDNF release emerges as a mechanism for activity-dependent LTP that may contribute to dentate gyrus-dependent learning, epilepsy, and neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>",2021-12-30

Effectors are critical for intracellular replication but can also enhance pathogen clearance in mammalian hosts via effector-triggered immunity. The effector LegC4 confers a fitness disadvantage on L. pneumophila within mouse models of Legionnaires' Disease and uniquely potentiates the antimicrobial activity of macrophages activated with either tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or interferon (IFN)-γ. Here, we investigated the mechanism of LegC4 function. We found that LegC4 binds proteasome activator (PA)28α, a subunit of the PA28αβ (11S) proteasome regulator, and that the LegC4 restriction phenotype is abolished within PA28αβ-deficient macrophages. PA28αβ facilitates ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation of oxidant-damaged proteins. Impaired proteasome activity results in compensatory upregulation of lysosomal degradation pathways to relieve oxidative proteotoxic stress. We found that LegC4 impairs the resolution of oxidative proteotoxic stress and enhances phagolysosomal fusion with the Legionella-containing vacuole. PA28αβ has been traditionally associated with antigen presentation and adaptive immunity; however, our data support a model whereby suppression of PA28αβ by LegC4 impairs resolution of oxidative proteotoxic stress, which culminates in the lysosomal killing of L. pneumophila within activated macrophages. This work provides a solid foundation on which to evaluate induced proteasome regulators as mediators of cell-autonomous immunity.</p>",2021-12-27

Deinococcus species have a complex cell envelope composed of L-ornithine containing peptidoglycan. Anabolism of L-ornithine is intrinsically linked to L-lysine and L-arginine biosynthetic pathways. To understand these two pathways, we analyzed the L-lysine and L-arginine pathways using 23 Deinococcus genomes, including D. indicus. We used BLAST-P based ortholog identification using D. radiodurans genes as the query. We identified some BLAST-P hits that shared the same functional annotation. We analyzed three (class I aminotransferase, acetyl-lysine deacetylase, and acetyl glutamate/acetyl aminoadipate kinase) from L-lysine biosynthesis pathway and three (bifunctional ornithine acetyltransferase or N-acetyl glutamate synthase protein, nitric oxide synthase-like protein, and Acetyl-lysine deacetylase) from L-arginine biosynthesis pathway. Two proteins showed certain structural variations. Specifically, [LysW]-lysine hydrolase protein sequence and structure level changes indicated changes in oligomeric conformation, which could likely be a result of divergent evolution. And, bifunctional ornithine acetyltransferase or N-acetyl glutamate synthase had its active site pocket positions shifted at the structural level and we hypothesize that it may not perform at the optimal level.

This signal sequestration mechanism appears in many natural biological systems and can potentially be easier to realise than 'molecular sequestration' and other comparison motifs that are nowadays common in biomolecular feedback control design. The loop is closed by linking the strength of signal sequestration to the process output. Our feedback regulation mechanism is motivated by two-component signalling systems, where we introduce a second response regulator competing with the natural response regulator thus sequestering kinase activity. Here, dichotomous feedback is established by increasing the concentration of the second response regulator as the level of the output of the natural process increases. Extensive analysis demonstrates how this type of feedback shapes the signal response, attenuates intrinsic noise while increasing robustness and reducing crosstalk.</p>",2021-12-27

To assess the real-world diagnostic performance of nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs for SD Biosensor STANDARD Q COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Diagnostic Test (Ag-RDT).
Methods
Individuals ≥5 years with COVID-19 compatible symptoms or history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 presenting at hospitals in Lesotho received two nasopharyngeal and one nasal swab. Ag-RDT from nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs were performed as point-of-care on site, the second nasopharyngeal swab used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as the reference standard. 
Results 
Out of 2198 participants enrolled, 2131 had a valid PCR result (61% female, median age 41 years, 8% children), 84.5% were symptomatic. Overall PCR positivity rate was 5.8%. The sensitivity for nasopharyngeal, nasal, and combined nasal and nasopharyngeal Ag-RDT result was 70.2% (95%CI: 61.3-78.0), 67.3% (57.3-76.3) and 74.4% (65.5-82.0), respectively.

Here we present computational and mathematical analyses of several different hypotheses of crossbridge dynamics, from 2-state to 5-state myosin II motor models, and show that an ensemble of actomyosin crossbridges exhibits surprisingly simple rheological behavior in all cases. The ensemble rheology is captured by a sum of at most three linear viscoelastic sub-processes, and as few as one for some crossbridge models. This simplification lends itself to computationally efficient phenomenological muscle models with experimentally measurable parameters, while still remaining grounded in crossbridge theory.

The right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) was involved in response inhibition, and the middle temporal (MT) region showed greater activity when dot motions involved less uncertainty. A neocortical temporal region in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) specifically showed greater activity during response inhibition in more perceptually certain trials. In this STS region, activity was greater when response inhibition was successful than when it failed. Directional effective connectivity analysis revealed that in more coherent trials, the MT and STS regions showed enhanced connectivity to the rIFC, whereas in less coherent trials, the signal direction was reversed.

RTL5 encodes a strongly acidic protein while RTL6 encodes an extremely basic protein, and the former is well conserved and the latter extremely well conserved among the eutherians, indicating their unique and critically important roles as acquired genes.

However, spines can have a limited size due to metabolic and neuroanatomical constraints, which should effectively limit the amount of encoded information in excitatory synapses. This study investigates how much information can be stored in the sizes of dendritic spines, and whether is it optimal in any sense? It is shown here, using empirical data for several mammalian brains across different regions and physiological conditions, that dendritic spines nearly maximize entropy contained in their volumes and surface areas for a given mean size. This result is essentially independent of the type of a fitting distribution to size data, as both short- and heavy-tailed distributions yield similar nearly 100 % information efficiency in the majority of cases, although heavy-tailed distributions slightly better fit the data. On average, the highest information is contained in spine volume, and the lowest in spine length or spine head diameter. Depending on a species and brain region, a typical spine can encode between 6.1 and 10.8 bits of information in its volume, and 3.1-8.1 bits in its surface area. Our results suggest a universality of entropy maximization in spine volumes and areas, which can be a new principle of memory storing in synapses.</p>",2021-12-30

Here, we find that microglia innately develop in unguided retinal organoid differentiation between week 3 and 4 in 2.5D culture and appear later in floating, non-pigmented, 3D-cystic compartments. We enriched for cystic structures using a low-dosed BMP4 application and performed mass spectrometry, thus defining the protein composition of microglia-containing compartments. We found that cystic compartments expressed both mesenchymal and epithelial markers with microglia enriched in the mesenchymal region. Interestingly, microglia-like cells started to express the border-associated macrophage marker CD163.

In mouse models of lung metastases, recruitment of classical monocytes from blood to the lung and their differentiation to metastasis-associated macrophages (MAMs) facilitate cancer cell extravasation, survival, and growth. Ablation of MAMs or their monocytic progenitors inhibits metastasis. We hypothesized that factors controlling macrophage polarization modulate tumor cell extravasation in the lung. We evaluated whether signaling by Th1 or Th2 cytokines in macrophages affected trans-endothelial migration of tumor cells in vitro. Interferon γ and LPS inhibited macrophage-dependent tumor cell extravasation while the Th2 cytokine interleukin-4 (IL4) enhanced this process. We demonstrated that IL4 receptor (IL4rα) null mice develop fewer and smaller lung metastasis. Adoptive transfer of wild type monocytes to IL4rα deficient mice rescued this phenotype. IL4 signaling in macrophages controls the expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR2, necessary for IL4-mediated tumor cell extravasation in vitro. Furthermore, IL4 signaling in macrophages transcriptionally regulates several other genes already causally associated with lung metastasis including CCL2, CSF1, CCR1, HGF and FLT1. The central role for IL4 signaling in MAMs was confirmed by high-resolution intravital imaging of the lung in mice at the time of metastatic seeding, which showed reduced physical interaction between tumor cells and IL4rα-deficient macrophages. This interaction enhances tumor cell survival. These data indicate that IL4 signaling in monocytes and macrophages is key during seeding and growth of breast metastasis in the lung as it regulates pro-tumoral paracrine signaling between cancer cells and macrophages.</p>",2021-12-29

Here we report on results from thermal denaturation analysis of two well-known proteins, human serum albumin and lysozyme, and a short DNA hairpin. The transition heat capacities at the Tm for the three molecules were quantitatively evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry. When normalized per gram rather than per mol the transition heat capacities were found to be precisely equivalent. This observation for the transition heat capacities of the proteins is consistent with previous reports. However, an identical transition heat capacity for DNA has not been reported and was unexpected.

Molecular dynamics simulations provided insights into how a single substitution could enhance the productive positioning of the 3′-amino nucleophile in the active site. Further remodeling of the protein-nucleic acid interface with substitutions in the finger subdomain led to a quadruple-mutant variant (9°N-NRQS) that incorporated 3′-NH<sub>2</sub>-ddNTPs into a 3′-amino-primer on various DNA templates.

DESIGN: Exploratory analysis from a multi-center prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Eight military hospitals across the United States between April 2020 and January 2021.
PATIENTS: Adult (≥18 years of age) SARS-CoV-2 positive inpatient and outpatient participants were enrolled with plasma samples selected from the putative inflammatory phase of COVID-19, defined as 15-28 days post symptom onset. 
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Concentrations of 12 inflammatory protein biomarkers were measured using a broad dynamic range immunoassay. TDA identified 3 distinct inflammatory protein expression clusters. Peak severity (outpatient, hospitalized, ICU admission or death), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and body mass index (BMI) were evaluated with logistic regression for associations with each cluster. The study population (n=129, 33.3% female, median 41.3 years of age) included 77 outpatient, 31 inpatient, 16 ICU-level, and 5 fatal cases.

We found binding of OsCBMIP to various CBM1-containing enzymes, suggesting it has a general role in inhibiting the catalytic activities of fungal enzymes. OsCBMIP is localized to the apoplast, and its expression is strongly induced in leaves infected with M. oryzae. Remarkably, knockdown of OsCBMIP reduced rice defense against M. oryzae, demonstrating that inhibition of CBM1-containing fungal enzymes by OsCBMIP is crucial for rice defense.

Here, we contribute to this framework by examining how OT modulates social brain network correlations during the resting and task states using fMRI. Firstly, we investigated network activation, followed by analyzing the relationship between networks and individual differences measured by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the Big-Five scales. Subsequently, we evaluated functional connectivity in both states. Finally, the relationship between networks across the states was represented by the predictive power of networks in the resting state for task-evoked activity. The difference in predicted accuracy between subjects displayed individual variations in this relationship. Our results showed decreased  dorsal default mode network (DDMN) for OT group in the resting state. Additionally, only in the OT group, the activity of the DDMN in the resting state had the largest predictive power for task-evoked activation of the precuneus network (PN). The results also demonstrated OT reduced individual variation of PN, specifically, the difference of accuracy between predicting a subject's own and others' PN task activation. These findings suggest a distributed but modulatory effect of OT on the association between resting brain networks and task-dependent brain networks, showing increased DDMN to PN connectivity after OT administration, which may support OT-induced distributed processing during task performance.</p>",2022-01-01

This auto-regulation improves the sensitivity of the TCS to stimuli and amplifies adaptive responses. The downside, however, is that the TCS may mount disproportionately large responses to weak or fleeting signals. How bacteria prevent such disproportionate responses is not known. Here, we show that sequestration of phosphorylated HKs by non-cognate RRs serves as a design to prevent such disproportionate responses. Using TCSs of M. tuberculosis as model systems, we found that with every one of the five HKs we studied, there was at least one non-cognate RR with higher affinity than that of the cognate RR for the HK. Phosphorylated HKs would thus preferentially bind the non-cognate RRs, suppressing signal transduction through the cognate pathways, which we demonstrated in vitro. Using mathematical modeling of TCS signaling in vivo, we predicted that this sequestration would introduce a threshold level of stimulation for a significant response, preventing responses to signals below this threshold. Finally, we showed in vivo using tunable expression systems in M. bovis that upregulation of a higher affinity non-cognate RR substantially suppressed the output from the cognate TCS pathway, presenting strong evidence of sequestration by non-cognate RRs as a design to regulate TCS signaling.

Using a genetic/chemical method to specifically ablate a neuromast, we found a small portion of larvae can regenerate a new neuromast, but the regeneration was hindered by inhibiting macrophages. We also demonstrated that the inhibition of macrophage can reduce the percentage of tail fin-amputated larvae to regenerate a new NM. By in toto imaging, we further discovered heterogeneities in macrophage behavior and distribution along lateral line. We witnessed the crawling of macrophages in between injured lateral line and SWCs during regeneration and also in between the second primordium and the first mature lateral line during development.

In all but one of 216 tests, pulsation caused a reversible increase, sometimes by a factor of 100 or more. The enhancement was greatest for frequencies 5-11 Hz  and, over the tested range of pressure heads (20 - 50 cmH2O), was greatest for the lowest pressure. The results suggest one reason why exercise slows the aging of the brain.</p>",2022-01-01

Tryon'}, {'name': 'Joshua X. Bratsch-Prince'}, {'name': 'James W. Warren'}, {'name': 'Grace C. Jones'}, {'name': 'Alexander J. McDonald'}, {'name': 'David D. Mott'}]","<p>The amygdalar anterior basolateral nucleus (BLa) plays a vital role in emotional behaviors. This region receives dense cholinergic projections from basal forebrain which are critical in regulating neuronal activity and synaptic transmission. Cholinergic signaling in BLa is thought to occur through both a slow mode of volume transmission as well as a rapid, phasic mode. However, the relative effect of each mode of signaling in BLa is not understood. Here, we used electrophysiology and optogenetics in mouse brain slices to compare regulation of afferent input from cortex and thalamus to the BLa by these two modes of transmission. Phasic ACh release evoked by single pulse stimulation of cholinergic terminals had a biphasic effect on glutamatergic transmission at cortical input, producing rapid nicotinic receptor-mediated facilitation followed by slower muscarinic receptor (mAChR)-mediated depression. In contrast, tonic elevation of ACh through application of the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine suppressed glutamatergic transmission at cortical inputs through mAChRs only. This suppression was not observed at thalamic inputs to BLa. In agreement with this pathway-specificity, the mAChR agonist, muscarine more potently suppressed transmission at inputs from prelimbic cortex (PL) than thalamus. Muscarinic inhibition at PL input was dependent on presynaptic M4 mAChRs, while at thalamic input it depended upon M3 mAChR-mediated stimulation of retrograde endocannabinoid signaling. Muscarinic inhibition at both pathways was frequency-dependent, allowing only high frequency activity to pass. These findings demonstrate complex cholinergic regulation of afferent input to BLa that depends upon the mode of ACh release and is both pathway specific and frequency dependent.</p>",2021-12-31

The promise of this approach hinges on an improved understanding of acyl carrier proteins (ACPs), which serve as central hubs in biosynthetic pathways. These small, flexible proteins mediate the transport of molecular building blocks and intermediates to enzymatic partners that extend and tailor the growing natural products. Past combinatorial biosynthesis efforts have failed due to incompatible ACP-enzyme pairings. Herein we report the design of chimeric ACPs with features of the actinorhodin polyketide synthase ACP (ACT) and of the E. coli fatty acid synthase (FAS) ACP (AcpP). We evaluate the ability of the chimeric ACPs to interact with the E. coli FAS ketosynthase FabF, which represents an interaction essential to building the carbon backbone of the synthase molecular output. Given that AcpP interacts with FabF but ACT does not, we sought to exchange modular features of ACT with AcpP to confer functionality with FabF. The interactions of chimeric ACPs with FabF were interrogated using sedimentation velocity experiments, surface plasmon resonance analyses, mechanism-based crosslinking assays, and molecular dynamics simulations. Results suggest that the residues guiding AcpP-FabF compatibility and ACT-FabF incompatibility may reside in the loop I, α-helix II region. These findings can inform the development of strategic secondary element swaps that expand the enzyme compatibility of ACPs across systems and therefore represent a critical step towards the strategic engineering of unnatural natural products.</p>",2021-12-30

Obtaining sufficient WGS data from clinical samples is often challenging especially from the samples with low viral load. We evaluated two SARS-CoV-2 sequencing protocols for their efficiency/accuracy and limitations. Sequence coverage of &gt;95% was obtained by Swift normalase amplicon SARS-CoV-2 panels (SNAP) protocol for all the samples with Ct ≤ 35 and by COVIDSeq protocol for 97% of samples with Ct ≤ 30. Sample RNA quantitation obtained using digital PCR provided more precise cutoff values. The quantitative digital PCR cutoff values for obtaining 95% coverage are 10.5 copies/μL for SNAP protocol and 147 copies/μL for COVIDSeq protocol. Combining FASTQ files obtained from 2 protocols improved the outcome of sequence analysis by compensating for missing amplicon regions. This process resulted in an increase of sequencing coverage and lineage call precision.</p>,2022-01-01

Wade'}, {'name': 'Gideon Schreiber'}]","<p>Crowded environments affect the pharmacokinetics of drug molecules. Here, we investigate how three macromolecular protein crowders, bovine serum albumin, hen egg-white lysozyme and myoglobin, influence the translational diffusion rates and interactions of four low molecular-weight drugs, fluorescein, doxorubicin, glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibitor SB216763 and quinacrine. Using Fluorescence Recovery After Photo-bleaching in Line mode (Line FRAP), Brownian dynamics simulations and molecular docking, we find that the diffusive behavior of the small molecules is highly affected by self-aggregation, interactions with the proteins, and surface adhesion. Fluorescein diffusion is decreased by protein crowders due to their interactions. On the other hand, for doxorubicin, the presence of protein crowders increases diffusion by reducing surface interactions. SB216763 shows a third scenario, where BSA, but not myoglobin or lysozyme, reduces self-aggregation, resulting in faster diffusion. Quinacrine was the only small molecule whose diffusion was not affected by the presence of protein crowders. The mechanistic insights gained here into the effects of interactions of small molecules with proteins and surfaces on the translational diffusion of small molecules can assist in optimizing the design of compounds for higher mobility and lower occlusion in complex macromolecular environments.</p>",2021-12-30

We demonstrate the pixOL algorithm for simultaneously optimizing all pixels within a phase mask to produce an engineered Green's tensor-the dipole extension of point-spread function engineering. The pixOL DSF achieves optimal precision for measuring simultaneously the 3D orientation and 3D location of a single molecule, i.e., 1.14 degree orientation, 0.24 sr wobble angle, 8.17 nm lateral localization, and 12.21 nm axial localization precisions over an 800-nm depth range using 2500 detected photons.

Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) plays a prominent role in mediating metastatic behavior by promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes. Migratory melanoma cells exhibit two major phenotypes: elongated mesenchymal or rounded amoeboid. The actomyosin cytoskeleton is key in both phenotypes, but intermediate filaments also undergo a significant rearrangement process, switching from cytokeratin-rich to vimentin and nestin-rich network. In this study, we aimed to investigate to what extent YB-1 impacts the biomechanical (cell stiffness) and biochemical aspects of melanoma cells and their cytoskeleton. To this end, we subjected A375 YB-1 knock-out and parental cells to atomic force microscopy investigations (stiffness determination), immunolabelling, and proteome analysis. We found that YB-1 expressing cells were significantly stiffer compared to the corresponding YB-1 knock-out cell line. Proteomic analysis revealed that expression of YB-1 results in a strong co-expression of nestin, vimentin, fascin-1, and septin-9. In the YB-1 knock-out nestin was completely depleted, but zyxin was strongly upregulated. Collectively, our results showed that YB-1 knock-out acquires some characteristics of mesenchymal phenotype but lacks important markers of malignancy and invasiveness such as nestin or vimentin. We posit that there is an association of YB-1 expression with an amoeboid phenotype, which would explain the increased migratory capacity.</p>",2021-12-29

We present NETISCE, a novel computational tool for identifying cell fate reprogramming targets in static networks. NETISCE identifies reprogramming targets through the innovative use of control theory within a dynamical systems framework. Through validations in studies of cell fate reprogramming from developmental, stem cell, and cancer biology, we show that NETISCE can predict previously identified cell fate reprogramming targets and identify potentially novel combinations of targets. NETISCE extends cell fate reprogramming studies to larger-scale biological networks without the need for full model parameterization and can be implemented by experimental and computational biologists to identify parts of a biological system that are relevant for the desired reprogramming task.</p>",2022-01-01
