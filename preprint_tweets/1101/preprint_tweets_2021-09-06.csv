The reported data of confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases in Karnataka from 1 July 2020 to 4 July 2021 is utilized to tune the model’s parameters, and an ensemble forecast is done from 5 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. The ensemble is built with 972 members by varying seven critical parameters that quantify the uncertainty in the spread dynamics (antibody waning, viral mutation) and interventions (pharmaceutical, non-pharmaceutical). The probability of Wave-3, the peak date distribution, and the peak caseload distribution are estimated from the ensemble forecast. Our analysis shows that the most significant causal factors are compliance to Covid-appropriate behavior, daily vaccination rate, and the immune escape new variant emergence-time. These causal factors determine when and how severe the Wave-3 of COVID-19 would be in Karnataka. We observe that when compliance to Covid-Appropriate Behavior is good (i.e., lockdown-like compliance), the emergence of new immune-escape variants beyond Sep ‘21 is unlikely to induce a new wave. A new wave is inevitable when compliance to Covid-Appropriate Behavior is only partial. Increasing the daily vaccination rates reduces the peak active caseload at Wave-3. Consequently, the hospitalization, ICU, and Oxygen requirements also decrease. Compared to Wave-2, the ensemble forecast indicates that the number of daily confirmed cases of children (0-17 years) at Wave-3’s peak could be seven times more on average. Our results provide insights to plan science-informed policy interventions and public health response.</p>",2021-09-02

In this study, taking advantage of the naturally synchronized mitoses of <italic>Drosophila</italic> early embryos, we provide evidence that the pioneer-like transcription factor GAF acts as stable mitotic bookmarker during zygotic genome activation.

We here defined a nucleo-adhesome, providing experimental evidence for a remarkable scale of nuclear localisation of adhesion proteins, establishing a framework for interrogating nuclear adhesion protein functions. In adding to nuclear FAK’s known roles in regulating transcription, we now show that nuclear FAK regulates expression of many adhesion-related proteins that localise to the nucleus and that nuclear FAK binds to the adhesome component and nuclear protein Hic-5. FAK and Hic-C work together in the nucleus, co-regulating a subset of genes transcriptionally.

Most crossovers that form in meiosis in budding yeast result from the biased resolution of double Holliday Junction (dHJ) intermediates. This dHJ resolution step involves the actions Rad2/XPG family nuclease Exo1 and the Mlh1-Mlh3 mismatch repair endonuclease. At present little is known about how these factors act in meiosis at the molecular level. Here we show that Exo1 promotes meiotic crossing over by protecting DNA nicks from ligation. We found that structural elements in Exo1 required for interactions with DNA, such as bending of DNA during nick/flap recognition, are critical for its role in crossing over. Consistent with these observations, meiotic expression of the Rad2/XPG family member Rad27 partially rescued the crossover defect in <italic>exo1</italic> null mutants, and meiotic overexpression of Cdc9 ligase specifically reduced the crossover levels of <italic>exo1</italic> DNA binding mutants to levels approaching the <italic>exo1</italic> null.

Most studies of profilin have focused on biochemical investigations using purified protein because high cellular concentrations (121 µM) present challenges for conventional imaging modalities. In addition, past studies that employed direct labeling or conventional fusion protein strategies compromised different facets of profilin function. We engineered a fluorescently-labeled profilin that retains native activities with respect to phosphoinositide lipids, actin monomers, formin-mediated actin assembly, and microtubule polymerization. This fluorescent profilin directly binds to dimers of tubulin (k<sub>D</sub> = 1.7 µM) and the microtubule lattice (k<sub>D</sub> = 10 µM) to stimulate microtubule assembly. In cells, our tagged profilin fully rescues profilin-1<sup>(-/-)</sup> cells from knockout-induced perturbations to cell shape, actin filament architecture, and microtubule arrays. Thus, this labeled profilin-1 is a reliable tool to investigate the dynamic interactions of profilin with actin or microtubules in live cell and in vitro applications.</p>",2021-09-02

We therefore propose here a novel dimensionality reduction framework: Delayed Latents Across Groups (DLAG). DLAG disentangles signals relayed in both directions; identifies how these signals are represented by each population; and characterizes how they evolve over time and trial-to-trial. We demonstrate that DLAG performs well on synthetic datasets similar in scale to current neurophysiological recordings. Then we study simultaneously recorded populations in primate visual areas V1 and V2, where DLAG reveals signatures of concurrent yet selective communication.

The decision-making processes underlying goal-directed action and serial reversal learning can be measured and are sensitive to changes reflecting cortico-striatal dysfunction. As such, changes in decision-making performance may assist with predicting functional decline in people with psychosis. We assessed decision-making processes in healthy controls (N=34), and those with early psychosis (N=15) and persistent psychosis (N=45). We subclassified subjects based on intact/impaired goal-directed action. Compared with healthy controls (&lt;20%), a large proportion (58%) of those with persistent psychosis displayed impaired goal-directed action, predicting poor serial reversal learning performance. Computational approaches indicated that those with persistent psychosis were less deterministic in their decision-making. Those with impaired goal-directed action had a decreased capacity to rapidly update their prior beliefs in the face of changing contingencies. In contrast, the early psychosis group included a lower proportion of individuals with impaired goal-directed action (20%) and displayed a different cognitive phenotype from those with persistent psychosis. These findings suggest prominent decision-making deficits, indicative of cortico-striatal dysfunction, are present in a large proportion of people with persistent psychosis while those with early psychosis have relatively intact decision-making processes compared to healthy controls.

The retrieval-related anterior shift is a phenomenon whereby the retrieval of a stimulus event (e.g., a scene image) is associated with a peak neural response which is localized more anteriorly than the response elicited when the stimulus is experienced directly. Here, we examine whether the magnitude of the anterior shift, i.e., the distance between encoding- and retrieval-related response peaks, is moderated by age, and also whether the shift is associated with memory performance. Younger and older human subjects of both sexes underwent fMRI as they completed encoding and retrieval tasks on word-face and word-scene pairs. We localized peak scene- and face-selectivity for each individual participant within the face-selective precuneus (PCU) and in three scene-selective (parahippocampal place area [PPA], medial place area [MPA], occipital place area [OPA]) regions of interest (ROIs). In line with recent findings, we identified an anterior shift in PPA and OPA in both age groups and, in older adults only, in MPA and PCU also. Of importance, the magnitude of the anterior shift was larger in older than in younger adults. The shift within the PPA exhibited an age-invariant across-participant negative correlation with source memory performance, such that a smaller displacement between encoding- and retrieval-related neural activity was associated with better performance.

While administration of CCP did not result in a detectable reduction in virus replication in the respiratory tract, it significantly reduced lung inflammation. These data, combined with the results of monoclonal antibody studies, emphasize the need to use products with high titers of neutralizing antibodies, and guide the future development of CCP-based therapies.</p></sec>",2021-09-01

We asked whether the reshaped functional miRNA landscape in cancers is driven by altered transcription of its precursors, or altered biogenesis and maturation of miRNAs. Integrated analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data in 9,111 samples across 10 cancer types and healthy tissues revealed a recurrent genomic switch from DICER-dependent to non-canonical Argonaute-mediated, DICER-independent, miRNA biogenesis. Experimental validation in AGO2-amplified clinical samples and cancer cell lines confirmed that canonical miRNAs can undergo maturation in a DICER-independent manner, and that elevated Argonaute levels promote selective maturation of the oncogenic miR-106b/25 cluster as shown by the altered ratio of mature miRNA to immature pri-miRNA levels. The preferential maturation of these oncogenic miRNAs, whose processing bypasses DICER1, promotes cancer progression and predicts poor prognosis. This highlights the evolution of non-canonical AGO2-dependent oncomiR processing as a novel driver pathway in cancer.</p>",2021-08-31

Clonal Mast Cells Activation Disorders (cMCADs) such as mastocytosis and clonal mast cells activation syndrome are characterized by an abnormal mast cells accumulation and/or activation. No data have been published on the anti-viral immune response of patients with cMCADs. The aims of the study were to collected, in a comprehensive way, outcomes of cMCADs patients who experienced a biologically-proven COVID-19 and to characterize both anti-endemic coronaviruses and specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in these patients. Clinical follow-up and outcome data were collected prospectively for one year within the French rare disease network CEREMAST encompassing patients from all over the country. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and anti-endemic coronaviruses specific T-cells were assessed with an enzyme-linked immunospot assay (EliSpot) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral response with dosage of circulating levels of specific IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibodies. Overall, 32 cMCADs patients were identified. None of them required non-invasive or mechanical ventilation; two patients were hospitalized to receive oxygen and steroid therapy. In 21 patients, a characterization of the SARS-CoV-2-specific immune response has been performed. A majority of patients showed a high proportion of circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific interferon (IFN)-γ producing T-cells and high levels of anti-Spike IgG antibodies with neutralizing activity. In addition, no defects in anti-endemic coronaviruses responses were found in patients with cMCADs compared to non-cMCADs controls. Patients with cMCADs frequently showed a spontaneous IFN-γ T-cell production in absence of any stimulation that correlated with circulating basal tryptase levels, a marker of mast cells burden. These findings underscore that patients with cMCADs might be not at risk of severe COVID-19 and the spontaneous IFN-γ production might explain this observation.</p><sec><title>Author Summary</title><p>Mast cells are immune cells involved in many biological processes including the anti-microbial response. However, previous studies suggest that mast cells may have a detrimental role in the response against viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, responsible for COVID-19. When a mutation occurs in mast cells, it can lead to a group of diseases called clonal mast cells activation disorders (cMCADs), characterized by deregulated activation of these cells. Hence, patients with cMCADs might be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 than general population.</p><p>We therefore conducted a 1-year study in France to collect data from all cMCADs patients included in the CEREMAST rare disease French network and who experienced COVID-19. Interestingly, we did not find any severe COVID-19 (i.e. requiring non-invasive or mechanical ventilation) in spite of well-known risk factors for severe COVID-19 in a part of cMCADs patients.</p><p>We then have studied the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and other endemic coronaviruses in these patients.

Comparative genomic analyses have unveiled some of the molecular changes associated with the C<sub>4</sub> pathway. For instance, several key enzymes involved in the transition from C<sub>3</sub> to C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis have been found to share convergent amino acid replacements along C<sub>4</sub> lineages. However, the extent of convergent replacements potentially associated with the emergence of C<sub>4</sub> plants remains to be fully assessed. Here, we introduced a robust empirical approach to test molecular convergence along a phylogeny including multiple C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub> taxa. By analyzing proteins encoded by chloroplast genes, we tested if convergent replacements occurred more frequently than expected in C<sub>4</sub> lineages compared to C<sub>3</sub> lineages.

Then, we inferred amino acid replacements along 13 C<sub>4</sub> lineages and 9 C<sub>3</sub> lineages using reconstructed protein sequences of their ancestral branches, corresponding to the most recent common ancestor of each lineage.

Pairs of C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> ancestral branches showed higher levels of convergent replacements than C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> pairs. Furthermore, we found that more proteins shared unique convergent replacements in C<sub>4</sub> lineages, with both RbcL and RpoC1 (the RNA polymerase beta’ subunit 1) showing a significantly higher convergent/divergent replacements ratio in C<sub>4</sub> branches. Notably, significantly more C<sub>4</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> pairs of ancestral branches showed higher numbers of convergent vs. divergent replacements than C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>4</sub> pairs. Our results demonstrated that, in the PACMAD clade, C<sub>4</sub> grasses experienced higher levels of molecular convergence than C<sub>3</sub> species across multiple chloroplast genes. These findings have important implications for both our understanding of the evolution of photosynthesis and the goal of engineering improved crop varieties that integrates components of the C<sub>4</sub> pathway.</p></sec>",2021-08-31

It has been hypothesised that high levels of alertness necessitated by EE might strengthen the right fronto-parietal networks (FPN) to facilitate this neurocognitive resilience. We have previously shown that EE offset age-related deficits in selective attention by preserving grey matter within right fronto-parietal regions. Here, using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), we examined the relationship between EE, microstructural properties of fronto-parietal white matter association pathways (three branches of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, SLF), structural brain health (atrophy), and attention (alertness, orienting and executive control) in a group of older adults. We show that EE is associated with a lower orientation dispersion index (ODI) within the right SLF1 which in turn mediates the relationship between EE and alertness, as well as grey- and white-matter atrophy. This suggests that EE may induce white matter plasticity (and prevent age-related dispersion of axons) within the right FPN to facilitate the preservation of neurocognitive health in later years.</p>",2021-09-01

However, due to the short length and flexible nature of peptides, many do not adopt one defined conformation prior to binding. Therefore, to tackle a peptide docking problem, not only the relative orientation between the two partners, but also the bound conformation of the peptide needs to be modeled. Traditional peptide-centered approaches use information about the peptide sequence to generate a representative conformer ensemble, which can then be rigid body docked to the receptor. Alternatively, one may look at this problem from the viewpoint of the receptor, namely that the protein surface defines the peptide bound conformation.We present PatchMAN (Patch-Motif AligNments), a novel peptide docking approach which uses structural motifs to map the receptor surface with backbone scaffolds extracted from protein structures. On a non-redundant set of protein-peptide complexes, starting from free receptor structures,  PatchMAN successfully models and identifies near-native peptide-protein complexes in 62% / 81% within 2.5Å / 5Å RMSD, with corresponding sampling in 81% / 100% of the cases, outperforming other approaches. PatchMAN leverages the observation that structural units of peptides with their binding pocket can be found not only within interfaces, but also within monomers. We show that the conformation of the bound peptide is sampled based on the structural context of the receptor only, without taking into account any sequence information. Beyond peptide docking, this approach opens exciting new avenues to study principles of peptide-protein association, and to the design of new peptide binders.</p>",2021-09-03

For each step, we review the different methods and parameter choices that have been used in the recent literature. Additionally, we present the results from a “Mutationathon”, a competition organized among five research labs to compare germline mutation rate estimates for a single pedigree of rhesus macaques. We report almost a two-fold variation in the final estimated rate among groups using different post-alignment processing, calling, and filtering criteria and provide details into the sources of variation across studies.
