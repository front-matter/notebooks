Here, we analyze 28,578 sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples from individuals with known immune status obtained through national community testing in the Netherlands from March to August 2021. We find evidence for an increased risk of infection by the Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), or Delta (B.1.617.2) variants compared to the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant after vaccination. No clear differences were found between vaccines. However, the effect was larger in the first 14-59 days after complete vaccination compared to 60 days and longer. In contrast to vaccine-induced immunity, no increased risk for reinfection with Beta, Gamma or Delta variants relative to Alpha variant was found in individuals with infection-induced immunity.</p>",2021-11-24

Mchaourab'}, {'name': 'Jens Meiler'}]","<p>Equilibrium fluctuations and triggered conformational changes often underlie the functional cycles of membrane proteins. For example, transporters mediate the passage of molecules across cell membranes by alternating between inward-facing (IF) and outward-facing (OF) states, while receptors undergo intracellular structural rearrangements that initiate signaling cascades. Although the conformational plasticity of these proteins has historically posed a challenge for traditional <italic>de novo</italic> protein structure prediction pipelines, the recent success of AlphaFold2 (AF2) in CASP14 culminated in the modeling of a transporter in multiple conformations to high accuracy. Given that AF2 was designed to predict static structures of proteins, it remains unclear if this result represents an underexplored capability to accurately predict multiple conformations and/or structural heterogeneity. Here, we present an approach to drive AF2 to sample alternative conformations of topologically diverse transporters and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are absent from the AF2 training set. Whereas models generated using the default AF2 pipeline are conformationally homogeneous and nearly identical to one another, reducing the depth of the input multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) led to the generation of accurate models in multiple conformations. In our benchmark, these conformations were observed to span the range between two experimental structures of interest, suggesting that our protocol allows sampling of the conformational landscape at the energy minimum. Nevertheless, our results also highlight the need for the next generation of deep learning algorithms to be designed to predict ensembles of biophysically relevant states.</p>",2021-11-22

Neural stem cell (NSC) functional decline results in decreased production of new neurons and defective regeneration upon injury during aging<sup>1–9</sup>, and this is exacerbated in Alzheimer’s disease<sup>10</sup>. Many genes are upregulated with age in NSCs<sup>3, 11–13</sup>, and the knockout of some of these boosts old NSC activation and rejuvenates aspects of old brain function<sup>14–18</sup>. But systematic functional testing of genes in old NSCs – and more generally in old cells – has not been done. This has been a major limiting factor in identifying the most promising rejuvenation interventions. Here we develop <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9 screening platforms to systematically uncover gene knockouts that boost NSC activation in old mice. Our genome-wide screening pipeline in primary cultures of young and old NSCs identifies over 300 gene knockouts that specifically restore old NSC activation. Interestingly, the top gene knockouts are involved in glucose import, cilium organization and ribonucleoprotein structures. To determine which gene knockouts have a rejuvenating effect for the aging brain, we establish a scalable CRISPR-Cas9 screening platform <italic>in vivo</italic> in old mice. Of the 50 gene knockouts we tested <italic>in vivo</italic>, 23 boost old NSC activation and production of new neurons in old brains. Notably, the knockout of <italic>Slc2a4</italic>, which encodes for the GLUT4 glucose transporter, is a top rejuvenating intervention for old NSCs. GLUT4 protein expression increases in the stem cell niche during aging, and we show that old NSCs indeed uptake ∼2-fold more glucose than their young counterparts. Transient glucose starvation increases the ability of old NSCs to activate, which is not further improved by knockout of <italic>Slc2a4/</italic>GLUT4. Together, these results indicate that a shift in glucose uptake contributes to the decline in NSC activation with age, but that it can be reversed by genetic or external interventions.

Contemporary theories, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suggest that the DMN is insulated from the external world, which allows it to support perceptually-decoupled states and to integrate external and internal information in the construction of abstract meanings. To date, the neuronal architecture of the DMN has received relatively little attention. Understanding the cytoarchitectural composition and connectional layout of the DMN will provide novel insights into its role in brain function. We mapped cytoarchitectural variation within the DMN using a cortical type atlas and a histological model of the entire human brain. Next, we used MRI acquired in healthy young adults to explicate structural wiring and effective connectivity. We discovered profound diversity of DMN cytoarchitecture. Connectivity is organised along the most dominant cytoarchitectural axis. One side of the axis is the prominent receiver, whereas the other side remains more insulated, especially from sensory areas. The structural heterogeneity of the DMN engenders a network-level balance in communication with external and internal sources, which is distinctive, relative to other functional communities. The neuronal architecture of the DMN suggests it is a protuberance from the core cortical processing hierarchy and holds a unique role in information integration.</p>",2021-11-22

The spatiotemporal patterns of epidemic year 1 have thus far been repeated (p&lt;.001) in epidemic year 2. The “checkerboard” pattern of the correlation matrix of case trajectories can be closely simulated as three sets of interacting sine waves with annual frequencies of 1:1:2 major cycles per year, corresponding to the northeastern, central/western, and southeastern state clusters. Case incidence patterns in Mexico and Canada have been similar to nearby regions in the southern US and the northern US, respectively. Time lapse videos allow visualization of the wave patterns.

Often these epidemic changes are attributed to localized human behavioral factors. Our finding of highly structured continental scale spatiotemporal patterns that cross state and national boundaries, coupled with emerging evidence of annual repetition of these same patterns, shows that COVID-19 transmission is driven at least in part by seasonal factors. Other epidemic factors such as vaccine coverage rates, or emergence of new strains like the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 appear to modify, but not totally eclipse, these underlying seasonal patterns. COVID-19 seasonal transmission patterns are associated with, and may be driven by, seasonal weather patterns.

GPCRs transduct chemical signals from extracellular to intracellular regions via a conformational switch between active and inactive states upon ligand binding. While experimental structures of GPCRs remain limited, high-accuracy computational predictions are now possible with AlphaFold2. However, AlphaFold2 only predicts one state and is biased towards the inactive conformation. Here, a multi-state prediction protocol is introduced that extends AlphaFold2 to predict either active or inactive states at very high accuracy using state-annotated templated GPCR databases. The predicted models accurately capture the main structural changes upon activation of the GPCR at the atomic level. The models were also highly successful in predicting ligand binding poses via protein-ligand docking. We expect that high accuracy GPCR models in both activation states will promote understanding in GPCR activation mechanisms and drug discovery for GPCRs. At the time, the new protocol paves the way towards capturing the dynamics of proteins at high-accuracy via machine-learning methods.</p>",2021-11-27

We aimed to clarify how prestimulus alpha influences performance and phenomenology, by recording simultaneous subjective measures of attention and confidence (Experiment 1), or attention and visibility (Experiment  2) on a trial-by-trial basis in a visual detection task.

In these cells, individual podosomes exhibit periodic protrusion and retraction cycles (vertical oscillations) to probe their microenvironment, while multiple podosomes arranged in clusters demonstrate coordinated wave-like spatiotemporal dynamics. However, the mechanisms governing both the individual vertical oscillations and the coordinated oscillation waves in clusters remain unclear. By integrating actin polymerization, myosin contractility, actin diffusion, and mechanosensitive signaling, we develop a chemo-mechanical model for both the oscillatory growth of individual podosomes and wave-like dynamics in clusters. Our model reveals that podosomes show oscillatory growth when the actin polymerization-associated protrusion and the signaling-associated myosin contraction occur at similar rates, while the diffusion of actin monomers within the cluster drives mesoscale coordination of individual podosome oscillations in an apparent wave-like fashion. Our model predicts the influence of different pharmacological treatments targeting myosin activity, actin polymerization, and mechanosensitive pathways, as well as the impact of the microenvironment stiffness on the wavelengths, frequencies, and speeds of the chemo-mechanical waves.

We hypothesized that extensive spatial variation in environmental conditions and the species homing behavior may promote the establishment of local adaptation. We genotyped 7,829 individuals representing 217 sampling locations at more than 100,000 high-quality RADseq loci to investigate how recombination might affect the detection of loci putatively under selection and took advantage of the precise description of the demographic history of the species from our previous work to draw accurate population genomic inferences about local adaptation. Results indicated that genetic differentiation scans and genetic-environment association analyses were both significantly affected by variation in recombination rate as low recombination regions displayed an increased number of outliers. By taking these confounding factors into consideration, we revealed that migration distance was the primary selective factor driving local adaptation and partial parallel divergence among distant populations.

Here, we have taken a pharmacological approach to test the role of a nutrient-regulated chromatin modifier, lysine-specific demethylase (LSD1), in obesity-associated metabolic reprogramming. We show that systemic administration of an LSD1 inhibitor (GSK-LSD1) reduces food intake and body weight, ameliorates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and improves insulin sensitivity and glycemic control in mouse models of obesity. GSK-LSD1 has little effect on systemic metabolism of lean mice, suggesting LSD1 has a context-dependent role in promoting maladaptive changes in obesity. Analysis of insulin target tissues identified white adipose tissue as the major site of insulin sensitization by GSK-LSD1, where it reduces adipocyte inflammation and lipolysis. We demonstrate that GSK-LSD1 reverses NAFLD in a non-hepatocyte-autonomous manner, suggesting an indirect mechanism via inhibition of adipocyte lipolysis and subsequent effects on lipid partitioning.

SVs are often overlooked due to difficult detection from short-read sequencing. Most algorithms yield low recall on humans, but the performance in other organisms is unclear. Similarly, despite remarkable differences across species’ genomes, most approaches use parameters optimized for humans. To overcome this and enable species-tailored approaches, we developed perSVade (personalized Structural Variation Detection), a pipeline that identifies SVs in a way that is optimized for any input sample. Starting from short reads, perSVade uses simulations on the reference genome to choose the best SV calling parameters. The output includes the optimally-called SVs and the accuracy, useful to assess the confidence in the results. In addition, perSVade can call small variants and copy-number variations. In summary, perSVade automatically identifies several types of genomic variation from short reads using sample-optimized parameters. We validated that perSVade increases the SV calling accuracy on simulated variants for six diverse eukaryotes, and on datasets of validated human variants. Importantly, we found no universal set of “optimal” parameters, which underscores the need for species-specific parameter optimization. PerSVade will improve our understanding about the role of SVs in non-human organisms.</p>",2021-11-23

They were adopted early in the field for many biotechnology applications, and as model systems to study plasmid biology. The mechanism of replication of ColE1 plasmids is well understood, involving the interaction between a plasmid-encoded sense-antisense gene pair (RNAI and RNAII). Because of its mechanism of replication, bacterial cells cannot maintain two different plasmids with the same origin, with one being rapidly lost from the population – a process known as plasmid incompatibility. While mutations in the regulatory genes RNAI and RNAII have been reported to make colE1 plasmids more compatible, there has been no attempt to engineer compatible colE1 origins, which can be used for multi-plasmid applications and that can bypass design constrains created by the current limited plasmid origin repertoire available. Here, we show that by targeting sequence diversity to the loop regions of RNAI (and RNAII), it is possible to select new viable colE1 origins that are compatible with the wild-type one. We demonstrate origin compatibility is not simply determined by sequence divergence in the loops, and that pairwise compatibility is not an accurate guide for higher order interactions. We identify potential principles to engineer plasmid copy number independently from other regulatory strategies and we propose plasmid compatibility as a tractable model to study biological orthogonality. New characterised plasmid origins increase flexibility and accessible complexity of design for challenging synthetic biology applications where biological circuits can be dispersed between multiple independent genetic elements.</p>",2021-11-25

Analysis of deduced amino acid sequences of the HA lineages illustrated key differences in regions of the globular head of hemagglutinin that overlap with established antigentic sites in homologous hemagglutinin H3, suggesting the possibility of antigenic differences among these HA lineages. Beyond HA, lineage replacement was common to all segments, such that novel genome constellations were detected across years.

We also found that T&gt;A mutations are enriched in older flies, and transcription-related enrichment terms are depleted in older males. Early spermatogenesis-enriched genes have lower dN/dS than late spermatogenesis-enriched genes, supporting the hypothesis that late spermatogenesis is the source of evolutionary innovation.

Recent work has uncovered event-related potential (ERP) correlates of confidence both during decision formation and after a decision has been made. However, the interpretation of these findings is complicated by methodological issues related to ERP amplitude measurement that are prevalent across existing studies. To more accurately characterise the neural correlates of confidence, we presented participants with a difficult perceptual decision task that elicited a broad range of confidence ratings. We identified a frontal ERP component within an onset prior to the behavioural response, which exhibited more positive-going amplitudes in trials with higher confidence ratings. This frontal effect also biased measures of the centro-parietal positivity (CPP) component at parietal electrodes via volume conduction. Amplitudes of the error positivity (Pe) component that followed each decision were negatively associated with confidence for trials with decision errors, but not for trials with correct decisions. We provide evidence for both pre- and post-decisional neural correlates of decision confidence that are observed in trials with correct and erroneous decisions, respectively. Our findings suggest that certainty in having made a correct response is associated with frontal activity during decision formation, whereas certainty in having committed an error is instead associated with the post-decisional Pe component. We additionally show that some previously reported associations between decision confidence and CPP/Pe component amplitudes are (at least partly) a consequence of ERP amplitude measurement-related confounds.</p>",2021-11-22

We compare the results of this search workflow to other library-free approaches and demonstrate that our search is competitive in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. These results demonstrate that the proposed workflow has the capacity to generate spectral libraries while avoiding the limitations of other methods.</p>",2021-11-22

Our work shows that most of the input to L1 is local, and that both local and long-range inputs to this layer arise predominantly from L2/3 and L5 neurons. Subtypes of L5 and L6b neurons project to the overlying L1 with different probabilities. VIP and SST interneurons in L2/3 and L5 also innervate L1. A subset of local L5, the intratelencephalic, pyramidal neurons, drive L1 interneurons but have no effect on L5 apical tuft dendrites.

We analysed these individually with respect to growth characteristics and impact on the transcriptome. We find that candidate clones for negative peptides lead to growth arrest by eliciting a general stress response.

This fibrous stroma, known as desmoplasia, causes the collapse of local blood vessels rendering a nutrient-deprived milieu. Hence, PDAC cells are nurtured by local CAF-secreted products, which include, among others, CAF-generated small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). It is well-accepted that upon culturing functionally tumor-promoting CAFs under pathophysiological-relevant conditions (e.g., within self-produced ECM), these cells express NetrinG1 (NetG1) and sustain endosomal pools rich in active α5β1-integrin; traits indicative of poor patient survival. We herein report that NetG1<sup>+</sup> CAFs generate sEVs that rescue PDAC cells from nutrient-deprived induced apoptosis.

Recently, many statistical methods have been developed for joint analysis of multiple phenotypes in genetic association studies, including the Clustering Linear Combination (CLC) method. The CLC method works particularly well with phenotypes that have natural groupings, but due to the unknown number of clusters for a given data, the final test statistic of CLC method is the minimum p-value among all p-values of the CLC test statistics obtained from each possible number of clusters. Therefore, a simulation procedure must be used to evaluate the p-value of the final test statistic. This makes the CLC method computationally demanding. We develop a new method called computationally efficient CLC (ceCLC) to test the association between multiple phenotypes and a genetic variant. Instead of using the minimum p-value as the test statistic in the CLC method, ceCLC uses the Cauchy combination test to combine all p-values of the CLC test statistics obtained from each possible number of clusters. The test statistic of ceCLC approximately follows a standard Cauchy distribution, so the p-value can be obtained from the cumulative density function without the need for the simulation procedure. Through extensive simulation studies and application on the COPDGene data, the results demonstrate that the type I error rates of ceCLC are effectively controlled in different simulation settings and ceCLC either outperforms all other methods or has statistical power that is very close to the most powerful method with which it has been compared.</p>",2021-11-22

We show how our method can enable the downstream accurate detection of spots. The architecture of DeepSpot is inspired by small object detection approaches. It incorporates dilated convolutions into a module specifically designed for the Context Aggregation for Small Object (CASO) and uses Residual Convolutions to propagate this information along the network. This enables DeepSpot to enhance all RNA spots to the same intensity and thus circumvents the need for parameter tuning. We evaluated how easily spots can be detected in images enhanced by our method, by training DeepSpot on 20 simulated and 1 experimental datasets, and have shown that more than 97% accuracy is achieved. Moreover, comparison with alternative deep learning approaches for mRNA spot detection (deepBlink) indicated that DeepSpot allows more precise mRNA detection.

While low temperature must slow degradation processes, the role of low humidity is not clear. We studied the effect of relative humidity on a model of influenza A H1N1 virus envelope, a supported lipid bilayer containing the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA), which is present in the viral envelope in very high density. For complete cycles of hydration, dehydration and rehydration, we evaluate the membrane properties in terms of structure and dynamics, which we assess by combining confocal fluorescence microscopy, raster image correlation spectroscopy, line-scan fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy.

This narrow angle loses a broader evolutionary and ecological context in which CyanoHABs occur and fails to provide information on relevant components to achieve a wholistic understanding. To derive a comprehensive mechanism of CyanoHABs, we examine CyanoHABs through the overlooked evolutionary and ecological lenses: evolutionary radiation, ecological comparison with co-living algae, and recently identified genomic functional repertoire between blooming and non-blooming species. We found key factors: (1) elaborate diverse functional repertoire and low nutrient requirement in cyanobacteria molded by early adaptive evolution, (2) cyanobacteria having lower nutrient requirements than green algae indeed, (3) there is no directed evolution in biological functions toward water eutrophication in cyanobacteria, (4) the CyanoHAB-associated functional repertoire are more abundant and complete in blooming than non-blooming species. These factors lead us to postulate a preliminary mechanism of CyanoHABs as a synergistic quad: superior functional repertoire, established with long adaptive radiation under nutrient-deficient conditions and not evolved toward eutrophic conditions, enables cyanobacteria to efficiently utilize elevated nutrients under current eutrophic regime for excess growth and CyanoHABs thereof, due to their lower nutrient requirements than co-living algae.

Novel sub-regional clustering analyses identified patterns of spatially restricted, temporally coherent, and frequency specific signals that were reproducible across days and were modulated by behavioral states. Clustering identified miniscule patches of neural tissue. Generalized eigen decomposition (GED) reduced each cluster to a single time series. Amplitude envelope correlation of the cluster time series was used to assess functional connectivity between clusters. Dense intra- and inter regional functional connectivity characterized the baseline period, with delta oscillations playing an outsized role. There was a dramatic pruning of network connectivity during encoding. Connectivity rebounded during consolidation, but connections in the theta band became stronger, and those in the delta band were weaker. Finally, during retrieval, connections were not as severely reduced as they had been during encoding, and specifically theta and higher-frequency connections were stronger. Underlying these connectivity changes, the anatomical extent of clusters observed in the gamma band in the PFC and in both the gamma and delta bands in the VTA changed markedly across behavioral conditions.

However, old and highly-degraded fossils are hard to identify, and standard methods (e.g. BLAST) are not optimized for this task. Here, a recently optimized method is used to find protein fossils in vertebrate genomes. It finds Paleozoic fossils predating the amphibian/amniote divergence from most major TE categories, including virus-related Polinton and Gypsy elements. It finds 10 fossils in the human genome (8 from TEs and 2 from host genes) that predate the last common ancestor of all jawed vertebrates, probably from the Ordovician period. It also finds types of transposon and retrotransposon not found in human before. These fossils have extreme sequence conservation, indicating exaptation: some have evidence of gene-regulatory function, and they tend to lie nearest to developmental genes. Some ancient fossils suggest ""genome tectonics"", where two fragments of one TE have drifted apart by up to megabases, possibly explaining gene deserts and large introns. This paints a picture of great TE diversity in our aquatic ancestors, with patchy TE inheritance by later vertebrates, producing new genes and regulatory elements on the way.

Moreover, restricting to non-contact pairs of sites preserves inference performance in the presence of strong phylogeny.

Furthermore, existing tools do not work well when genetic information has errors at levels observed in modern datasets. Here, we present a novel approach to solve these problems. Our method is significantly more accurate than existing tools and more tolerant of errors in the genetic data.

Existing data in mammalian cells suggests that such transcriptional ""noise"" is transmitted by some genes and not others, suggesting that noise transmission is tunable, perhaps at the expense of other signal processing capabilities. However, systematic claims about noise transmission in genetic networks have been limited by the inability to directly measure noise transmission. Here we build a mathematical framework capable of modeling allelic correlation and noise transmission. We find that allelic correlation and noise transmission correspond across a broad range of model parameters and network architectures. We further find that limiting noise transmission comes with the trade-off of being unresponsive to signals, and that within the parameter regimes that are responsive to signals, there is a further trade-off between response time and basal noise transmission. Using a published allele specific single cell RNA-sequencing dataset, we found that genes with high allelic odds ratios are enriched for cell-type specific functions, and that within multiple signaling pathways, factors which are upstream in the pathway have higher allelic odds ratios than downstream factors. Overall, our findings suggest that some degree of noise transmission is required to be responsive to signals, but that minimization of noise transmission can be accomplished by trading-off for a slower response time.</p>",2021-11-26

The identification of sequence variants is an important step when processing large NGS datasets; however, currently, the process is complicated, repetitive, and requires concentration, which can be taxing on the researcher. Therefore, to support researchers who are not familiar with bioinformatics in identifying sequence variations regularly from large datasets, we have developed a fully automated desktop software, NGSpop. NGSpop includes functionalities for all the variant calling and visualization procedures used when processing NGS data, such as quality control, mapping, filtering details, and variant calling. In the variant calling step, the user can select the GATK or DeepVariant algorithm for variant calling. These algorithms can be executed using pre-set pipelines and options or customized with the user-specified options. NGSpop is implemented using JavaFX (version 1.8) and can thus be run on Unix like operating systems such as Ubuntu Linux (version 16.04, 18.0.4). Although there are several pipelines and visualization tools available for NGS data analysis, most integrated environments do not support batch processes; thus, variant detection cannot be automated for population-level studies. The NGSpop software, developed in this study, has an easy-to-use interface and helps in rapid analysis of multiple NGS data from population studies.</p>",2021-11-22

Specifically, we confirm the non-randomness of recombination breakpoints across all six tested coronavirus subgenera, locate conserved recombination hot- and cold-spots, and determine that the locations of transcriptional regulatory sequences are likely major determinants of conserved recombination breakpoint hot-spot locations. We find that while the locations of recombination breakpoints are not uniformly associated with degrees of nucleotide sequence conservation, they display significant tendencies in multiple coronavirus subgenera to occur in low guanine-cytosine content genome regions, in non-coding regions, at the edges of genes, and at sites within the Spike gene that are predicted to be minimally disruptive of Spike protein folding.

But how relevant are such trial-averaged responses to neuronal computation itself? Here we present a simple test to estimate whether average responses reflect aspects of neuronal activity that contribute to neuronal processing in a specific context. The test probes two assumptions inherent in the usage of average neuronal metrics: 1) Reliability: Neuronal responses repeat consistently enough across single stimulus instances that the average response template they relate to remains recognizable to downstream regions. 2) Behavioural relevance: If a single-trial response is more similar to the average template, this should make it easier for the animal to identify the correct stimulus or action. We apply this test to a large publicly available data set featuring electrophysiological recordings from 42 cortical areas in behaving mice. In this data set, we show that single-trial responses were less correlated to the average response template than one would expect if they simply represented discrete versions of the template, down-sampled to a finite number of spikes. Moreover, single-trial responses were barely stimulus-specific — they could not be clearly assigned to the average response template of one stimulus. Most importantly, better-matched single-trial responses did not predict accurate behaviour for any of the recorded cortical areas.

As the COVID-19 global pandemic surpassed one year, several variants had emerged resulting in increased severity and transmissibility. In order to reduce the impact on human life, it is critical to rapidly identify which genetic variants result in increased virulence or transmission. To address the former, we evaluated if a genome-based predictive algorithm designed to predict clinical severity could predict polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results, as a surrogate for viral load and severity. Using a previously published algorithm, we compared the viral genome-based severity predictions to clinically-derived PCR-based viral load of 716 viral genomes. For those samples predicted to be “severe” (predicted severity score &gt; 0.5), we observed an average cycle threshold (Ct) of 18.3, whereas those in in the “mild” category (severity prediction &lt; 0.5) had an average Ct of 20.4 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0017). We found a non-trivial correlation between predicted severity probability and cycle threshold (<italic>r</italic> = −0.199). Additionally, when divided into quartiles by prediction severity probability, the most probable quartile (≥75% probability) had a Ct of 16.6 (n=10) as compared to those least probable to be severe (&lt;25%) of 21.4 (n=350) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0045). Taken together, our results suggest that the severity predicted by a genome-based algorithm can be related to the metrics from the clinical diagnostic test, and that relative severity may be inferred from diagnostic values.</p>",2021-11-24

Participants performed a visual classification task under varying levels of perceptual difficulty, while we acquired fMRI. Using a model-based representational similarity approach, we tested whether stimulus representations retain exemplar-level information. We expected representations to drop such exemplar-level information as perceptual difficulty increases, which would indicate a focus on representing behaviorally relevant category information. Counter to these expectations, and in contrast to previous research, we found frontal and parietal brain regions contained exemplar-level stimulus information.

We propose an alignment-free in silico approach for classifying SARS-CoV-2 variants based on their genomic sequences. A deep learning model was constructed utilizing a stacked 1-D convolutional neural network and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The pre-processed genomic sequencing data of the four SARS-CoV-2 variants were first fed to three stacked convolution-pooling nets to extract local linkage patterns in the sequences. Then a 2-layer MLP was used to compute the correlations between the input and output. Finally, a logistic regression model transformed the output and returned the probability values. Learning curves and stratified 10-fold cross-validation showed that the proposed classifier enables robust variant classification. External validation of the classifier showed an accuracy of 0.9962, precision of 0.9963, recall of 0.9963 and F1 score of 0.9962, outperforming other machine learning methods, including logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and random forest. By comparing our model with an MLP model without the convolution-pooling network, we demonstrate the essential role of convolution in extracting viral variant features.

Little is known, however, about the neural mechanisms of learning through cooperation. We addressed this research gap by leveraging functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to record the brain activity of triad members in a group simultaneously. Triads were instructed to analyze an ancient Chinese poem either cooperatively or independently. Four main findings emerged. First, we observed significant within-group neural synchronization (GNS) in the left superior temporal cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus during cooperative learning compared to independent learning. Second, the enhancement of GNS in triads was amplified when a consensus was reached (vs. elaboration or argument) during cooperative learning. Third, GNS was predictive of learning outcome at an early stage (156-170 s after learning was initiated). Fourth, social factors such as social closeness (e.g., how much learners liked one other) were reflected in GNS and co-varied with learning engagement.

Here, we report that unlike individuals who worked alone, the brains of students who worked cooperatively with one another became synchronized. This within-group neural synchronization (GNS) was magnified when learners built mutual consensuses. These findings suggest that successful cooperative learning involves dynamic consensus building, which is reflected in the interpersonal coordination of cerebral activity.</p></sec>",2021-11-24

Thus, it is essential to develop accessible second-generation COVID-19 vaccines against known and future VoCs to mitigate the current pandemic. Here, we provide preclinical data showing the immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety results in mice of a receptor-binding domain (RBD)-based recombinant protein vaccine candidate (PHH-1V) which consists of a novel RBD fusion heterodimer containing the B.1.1.7 (alpha) and B.1.351 (beta) variants of SARS-CoV-2, formulated with an oil-based adjuvant equivalent to MF59C.1.

We find that these phage-derived proteins are extremely distinct in structure, some of which have no homologues in the current protein structure domain. Furthermore, we find a novel family of Anti-CRISPR proteins which are structurally homologous to the recently-discovered mechanism of manipulating host proteins through enzymatic activity, rather than through direct inference.

These traits were measured in a panel of 147 African rice Oryza glaberrima genotypes, known as potential sources of tolerance genes to biotic and abiotic stresses. Our results reveal that higher transpiration efficiency is associated with transpiration restriction in African rice. Detailed measurements in a subset of highly differentiated genotypes confirmed these associations and suggested that the root to shoot ratio played an important role in transpiration restriction.

In this study, we predicted several potential T cell epitopes with web-based analytic tools, and narrowed them down from several potential MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes by ELIspot and cytolytic assays to a conserved MHC-I epitope. The epitope is highly conserved in current viral variants and compatible with presentation by most HLA alleles worldwide.

The disease primarily infects domestic animals such as sheep, goats, and cattle, resulting in a spectrum of clinical outcomes including morbidity, massive storm abortions, and neonatal fatalities. RVF outbreaks are closely linked to above-average rainfall and flooding, which create an ideal environment for mosquitos to breed, multiply, and transmit the virus to animals. The outcomes of human RVF infection range from self-limiting febrile illness to potentially fatal hemorrhagic diatheses and miscarriage in pregnant women. Collectively, the economic losses due to the zoonotic RVF disease is immense. Methods: Using the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) package, RNA-Seq data generated from five healthy Bos taurus steer calves aged 4-6 months was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (Accession number GSE71417). The data was utilized to construct a gene co-expression network. Enriched modules containing genes potentially involved in RVF infection progression were identified. Moreover, using the Multiple Expectation Maximizations for Motif Elicitation (MEME) suite, consensus regulatory motifs of enriched gene clusters were deciphered and the most abundant putative regulatory motif in each enriched module unveiled by comparative analysis with publicly available motifs using the TOMTOM motif comparison tool. The potential roles of the identified regulatory motifs were inferred by literature mining. Results: The constructed gene co-expression network revealed thirty-three (33) modules, nine of which were enriched for Gene Ontology terms linked to RVF pathogenesis. Functional enrichment in two (red and turquoise) of the nine modules was significant. ASH1-like histone lysine methyltransferase and Astrotactin were the hub genes for the red and turquoise modules respectively. ASH1-like histone lysine methyltransferase gene is involved in chromatin epigenetic modification while Astrotactin is a vertebrate-specific gene that plays an important role in neurodevelopment. Additionally, consensus regulatory motifs located on the 3' end of genes in each enriched module was identified. Conclusions: In this study, we have developed a gene co-expression network that has aided in the unveiling of functionally related genes, intramodular hub genes, and immunity genes potentially involved in RVF pathogenesis. The discovery of functional genes with putative critical roles in the establishment of RVF infection establishment will contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanism of RVF pathogenesis. Importantly, the putative regulatory motifs identified are plausible targets for RVF drug and vaccine development.

The discovery of the chemokine interactome, i.e. heteromeric chemokine-chemokine interactions, even across CC- and CXC-class borders, has further expanded the complexity within the network. Moreover, some inflammatory mediators, which are not structurally linked to classical CC-, CXC-, CX3C-, or C-chemokines, can bind to chemokine receptors and behave as atypical chemokines (ACKs). We identified the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) as an ACK that binds to the chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4 to promote atherogenic leukocyte recruitment. Here, we hypothesized that chemokine-chemokine interactions extend to ACKs and that MIF may form heterocomplexes with classical chemokines. We tested this hypothesis, applying an unbiased chemokine protein binding array. The platelet chemokine CXCL4L1, but not its variant CXCL4 or the CXCR2/CXCR4 ligands CXCL8 or CXCL12, was identified as a candidate interactor. MIF/CXCL4L1 complexation was verified by co-immunoprecipitation, surface plasmon-resonance analysis, and microscale thermophoresis, which also established high-affinity binding (KD=100-150 nM). The binding interface was predicted by peptide array-based mapping and molecular docking. We next determined whether heterocomplex formation modulates inflammatory and atherogenic activities of MIF. MIF-elicited T-cell chemotaxis as assessed in a 3D-matrix-based live cell-imaging set-up was abrogated, when cells were co-incubated with MIF and CXCL4L1. Heterocomplexation also blocked MIF-triggered migration of Egfp+ microglia in cortical cultures in situ. Of note, CXCL4L1 blocked the binding of Alexa-MIF to a soluble ectodomain mimic of CXCR4 and co-incubation with CXCL4L1 attenuated MIF-triggered dynamic mass redistribution in HEK293-CXCR4 transfectants, indicating that complex formation interferes with MIF/CXCR4 pathways. As MIF and CXCL4L1 are abundant platelet products, we finally tested their role in platelet activation. Multi-photon microscopy, FLIM-FRET, and proximity ligation assay visualized heterocomplexes in platelet aggregates and clinical human thrombus sections. Moreover, heterocomplex formation inhibited MIF-stimulated thrombus formation under flow and skewed the morphology of adhering platelets from a large to a small lamellipodia phenotype. Together, our study establishes a novel molecular interaction, adding to the complexity of the chemokine interactome and chemokine/receptor network. MIF/CXCL4L1, or more generally, ACK/CXC-motif chemokine heterocomplexes may be promising target structures to modulate inflammation and thrombosis.</p>",2021-11-26

Tail-pinch decreased extracellular DA release in the nucleus accumbens ventrolateral shell, which was blocked by disruption of the LH. Furthermore, tail-pinch attenuated cocaine-induced locomotor activity, 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior, which was inhibited by chemogenetic silencing of the LH-LHb pathway.

Recently, a representative bacterial synthetic community from maize roots has been proposed as a model system to study microbiome stability (Niu 2017, PNAS, 114:E2450). This SynCom assembles stably when all seven members are present, but community diversity collapses without the keystone E. cloacae strain. The aim of this study was to assess the role of metabolites for the stability of this SynCom, by defining the metabolic niches occupied by each strain, as well as their cross-feeding phenotypes and B-vitamin dependencies. We show that the individual member strains occupy complementary metabolic niches, measured by the depletion of distinct metabolites in exometabolomic experiments, as well as contrasting growth phenotypes on diverse carbon substrates. Minimal medium experiments show that the established seven-member community comprises a mixture of prototrophic and auxotrophic strains. Correspondingly, experimental cross-feeding phenotypes showed that spent media harvested from the prototrophic strains can sustain growth of two auxotrophs. We suggest that the metabolic mechanisms exhibited by this SynCom could serve as design principles to inform the rational assembly of stable plant-associated microbial communities.</p>",2021-11-28

Bulk segregant analysis (BSA) offers a powerful and efficient alternative to identify loci underlying complex traits in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. 
Methods: We have used BSA, which combines genetic crosses using humanized mice with pooled sequencing of progeny populations to measure changes in allele frequency following selection with antimalarial drugs. We used dihydroartemisinin (DHA) drug selection in two genetic crosses (Mal31xKH004 and NF54xNHP1337). We specifically investigated how synchronization, cryopreservation, and the drug selection regimen of progeny pools impacted the success of BSA experiments.
Findings: We detected a strong and repeatable quantitative trait locus (QTL) at chr13 kelch13 locus in both crosses, but did not detect QTLs at ferredoxin (fd), the apicoplast ribosomal protein S10 (arps10), multidrug resistance protein 2 (mdr2). QTLs were detected using synchronized, but not unsynchronized pools, consistent with the stage-specific action of DHA. We also successfully applied BSA to cryopreserved progeny pools.
Interpretation: Our results provide proof-of-principal of the utility of BSA for rapid, robust genetic mapping of drug resistance loci. Use of cryopreserved progeny pools expands the utility of BSA because we can conduct experiments using archived progeny pools from previous genetic crosses. BSA provides a powerful approach that complements traditional QTL methods for investigating the genetic architecture of resistance to antimalarials, and to reveal new or accessory loci contributing to artemisinin resistance.</p>",2021-11-24

Most existing methods rely on nonparametric regression models for their flexibility; however, nonparametric models often provide trends too complex to interpret. Other existing methods use interpretable but restrictive models. Since model interpretability and flexibility are both indispensable for understanding biological processes, the single-cell field needs a model that improves the interpretability and largely maintains the flexibility of nonparametric regression models. Here we propose the single-cell generalized trend model (scGTM) for capturing a gene's expression trend, which may be monotone, hill-shaped, or valley-shaped, along cell pseudotime. The scGTM has three advantages: (1) it can capture non-monotonic trends that are still easy to interpret, (2) its parameters are biologically interpretable and trend informative, and (3) it can flexibly accommodate common distributions for modeling gene expression counts. To tackle the complex optimization problems, we use the particle swarm optimization algorithm to find the constrained maximum likelihood estimates for the scGTM parameters. As an application, we analyze several single-cell gene expression data sets using the scGTM and show that it can capture interpretable gene expression trends along cell pseudotime and reveal molecular insights underlying the biological processes.

We investigated the role of pyruvate kinase muscle isoforms (PKM1/2) in naïve, formative, and primed mouse embryonic stem cells through modulation of PKM1/2 mRNA transcripts using steric blocking morpholinos that downregulate PKM2 and upregulate PKM1. We have examined these effects in naïve, formative, and primed cells by quantifying the effects of PKM1/2 modulation on pluripotent and metabolic transcripts and by measuring shifts in the population frequencies of cells expressing naïve and primed cell surface markers by flow cytometry. Our results demonstrate that modulating PKM1 and PKM2 levels alters the transition from the naïve state into a primed pluripotent state by enhancing the proportion of the affected cells seen in the “formative” state.

Cell death correlated with the activation of cellular oxidative stress. Of the twelve proteins, ORF3a was chosen for further study in mammalian cells. In human pulmonary and kidney epithelial cells, ORF3a induced cellular oxidative stress associated with apoptosis and necrosis, and caused activation of pro-inflammatory response with production of the cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-β1, possibly through the activation of NF-κB. To further characterize the mechanism, we tested a natural ORF3a Beta variant, Q57H, and a mutant with deletion of the highly conserved residue, ΔG188.

Using two-color functional imaging we demonstrate that spontaneous activity in hair cells does not correlate with activity in either supporting cells or cholinergic terminals. We find that during lateral-line development, hair cells autonomously generate spontaneous events. Using localized calcium indicators, we show that within hair cells, spontaneous calcium activity occurs in two distinct domains–the mechanosensory bundle and the presynapse. Further, spontaneous activity in the mechanosensory bundle ultimately drives spontaneous calcium influx at the presynapse. Comprehensively, our results indicate that in developing lateral-line hair cells, autonomously generated spontaneous activity originates with spontaneous mechanosensory events.

Here, we combine network and evolutionary theory to simulate how shifts in interaction types alter the coevolution of empirical communities. We show that as mutualistic networks shift to antagonistic, selection imposed by direct partners begins to outweigh that imposed by indirect partners. This weakening of indirect effects is associated with communities losing their tight integration of traits and increasing their rate of adaptation. The above changes are more pronounced when specialist consumers are the first species to switch to antagonism. A shift in the outcome of species’ interactions may therefore reverberate across communities and alter the direction and speed of coevolution.</p>",2021-11-22

As they are present in different copy numbers in males and females, they are expected to experience different selection pressures than the autosomes, with consequences including a faster rate of evolution, increased accumulation of sexually antagonistic alleles, and the evolution of dosage compensation. Whether these consequences are general or linked to idiosyncrasies of specific taxa is not clear as relatively few taxa have been studied thus far. Here we use whole-genome sequencing to identify and characterize the evolution of the X chromosome in five species of Timema stick insects with XX:X0 sex determination. The X chromosome had a similar size (approximately 11% of the genome) and gene content across all five species, suggesting that the X chromosome originated prior to the diversification of the genus. Genes on the X showed evidence of a faster evolutionary rate than genes on the autosomes, likely due to less effective purifying selection. Genes on the X also showed almost complete dosage compensation in somatic tissues (heads and legs), but dosage compensation was absent in the reproductive tracts. Contrary to prediction, sex-biased genes showed little enrichment on the X, suggesting that the advantage X-linkage provides to the accumulation of sexually antagonistic alleles is weak. Overall, we found the consequences of X-linkage on gene sequences and expression to be similar across Timema species, showing the characteristics of the X chromosome are surprisingly consistent over 30 million years of evolution.</p>",2021-11-28

Therefore, we followed an alternative functional genomics approach to examine the role of the CLas effectors in HLB pathogenesis in general and more specifically in suppressing citrus innate immune response.  Here, we focused on the CLas effectors, P235 and Effector 3, to perform the following studies.  First, proteomic studies by LC-MS/MS were conducted to screen the putative interacting citrus protein partners of P235 and Effector 3 from the healthy and CLas-infected Hamlin extracts and the most probable candidates were identified based upon their high protein scores from LC-MS/MS.  Second, a transgenic tobacco split GFP system was designed for in planta detection of the most probable citrus interacting protein partners of P235 and Effector 3.  Third, in vitro and in planta studies were performed to show that each of two effectors interacts with and inhibits the functions of multiple citrus proteins belonging to the innate immune pathways.  These inhibitory interactions led to a high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), blocking of bactericidal lipid binding protein (LTP), and induction of premature programmed cell death (PCD), thereby supporting CLas infection and HLB pathogenesis.

Here we use two GBM stem cell lines, representing the classical/pro-neural and mesenchymal GBM subtypes, to investigate the effects of three different EZH2 inhibitors on GBM stem cell survival and gene expression: EPZ6438, GSK343 and UNC1999. EZH2 is the catalytic component of the PRC2 chromatin repressor complex, which represses transcription through methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27. Both cell lines showed significantly reduced colony formation after 48-hour exposure to the inhibitors, indicating they were sensitive to all three EZH2 inhibitors. RNA-seq analysis revealed that all three EZH2 inhibitors led to increased expression of genes related to neurogenesis and/or neuronal structure in both GBM stem cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-Seq) was used to identify potential direct targets of the histone methylation activity of EZH2 that might be driving the increase in neuronal gene expression. Three genes were identified as candidate regulatory targets common to both cell lines: MAFB, ZIC2 and ZNF423. These transcription factors all have known roles in regulating neurogenesis, brain development and/or neuronal function. Through analysis of three different EZH2 inhibitors and two GBM stem cell lines, this study demonstrates a common underlying mechanism for how inhibition of EZH2 activity reduces GBM stem cell proliferation and survival.</p>",2021-11-22

Song'}, {'name': 'R. Luke Wiseman'}, {'name': 'Gabriel C.

In yeast, dysregulation of Lon protease (PIM1) attenuates lifespan and leads to gross mitochondrial morphologic perturbations. Although structures of bacterial and human Lon protease reveal a hexameric assembly, PIM1 was speculated to form a heptameric assembly, and is uniquely characterized by a ~50 residue insertion between the ATPase and protease domains. To understand the yeast-specific properties of PIM1, we determined a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of PIM1 in a substrate-translocating state. Here, we reveal that PIM1 forms a hexamer, conserved with that of bacterial and human Lon proteases, wherein the ATPase domains form a canonical closed spiral that enables pore loop residues to translocate substrate to the protease chamber. In the substrate-translocating state, PIM1 protease domains form a planar protease chamber in an active conformation and are uniquely characterized by a ~15 residue C-terminal extension. These additional C-terminal residues form an alpha-helix that is located along the base of the protease domain. Finally, we did not observe density for the yeast-specific insertion between the ATPase and protease domains, likely due to high conformational flexibility. Biochemical studies to investigate the insertion using constructs that truncated or replaced the insertion with a glycine-serine linker suggest that the yeast-specific insertion is dispensable for PIM1’s enzymatic function. Altogether, our structural and biochemical studies highlight unique components of PIM1 machinery and demonstrate evolutionary conservation of Lon protease function.</p>",2021-11-25

In this study, we used comparative genomic methods to study immune genes in island species (N = 20) and their mainland relatives (N = 14). We gathered public data as well as generated new data on innate (Toll-Like Receptors, Beta Defensins) and acquired immune genes (Major Histocompatibility Complex classes I and II), but also on hundreds of genes annotated as involved in various immune functions. As a control, we used a set of 97 genes not involved in immune functions, to account for the lower effective population sizes in island species.

For the genes evolving under balancing selection, we used simulation to estimate the impact of population size variation. We found a significant effect of drift on immune genes of island species leading to a reduction in genetic diversity and efficacy of selection. However, the intensity of relaxed selection was not significantly different from control genes, except for MHC class II genes. These genes exhibit a significantly higher level of non-synonymous loss of polymorphism than expected assuming only drift and an evolution under frequency dependent selection, possibly due to a reduction of extracellular parasite communities on islands.

Several patient reports with multiple pathologies – ischemic strokes, mild infarcts, encephalitis, cerebro-vascular abnormalities, cerebral inflammation, and loss of consciousness, indicate CNS involvement. However, due to limited neuroimaging studies, conclusive group level effects are scarce in the literature and replication studies are necessary to verify if these effects persist in surviving acute-COVID patients. Furthermore, recent reports indicate fatigue is highly prevalent among slowly recovering patients. How early structural changes relate to fatigue need to be investigated. Our goal was to address this by scanning COVID subjects two weeks after hospital discharge. We hypothesized these surviving patients will demonstrate altered gray matter volume (GMV) when compared to healthy controls and further demonstrate correlation of GMV with fatigue. Voxel-based morphometry was applied to T1-weighted MRI images between 46 patients with COVID and 32 healthy controls. Significantly higher GMV in the <italic>Limbic System</italic> and <italic>Basal Ganglia</italic> regions were observed in surviving COVID-19 patients when compared to healthy controls. Moreover, within the patient group, there was a significant positive correlation between GMV and self-reported fatigue scores during work, within the <italic>ventral Basal Ganglia</italic> and <italic>Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex</italic> regions.

A1Rs on other striatal neurons are activated by an adenosine tone that is limited by equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) that is enriched on astrocytes and is ethanol-sensitive. We explored whether dopamine release in nucleus accumbens core is under tonic inhibition by A1Rs, and is regulated by astrocytic ENT1 and ethanol. In ex vivo striatal slices from male and female mice, A1R agonists inhibited dopamine release evoked electrically or optogenetically and detected using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, most strongly for lower stimulation frequencies and pulse numbers, thereby enhancing the activity-dependent contrast of dopamine release. Conversely, A1R antagonists reduced activity-dependent contrast but enhanced evoked dopamine release levels, even for single optogenetic pulses indicating an underlying tonic inhibition. The ENT1 inhibitor NBTI reduced dopamine release and promoted A1R-mediated inhibition, and conversely, virally-mediated astrocytic overexpression of ENT1 enhanced dopamine release and relieved A1R-mediated inhibition. By imaging the genetically encoded fluorescent adenosine sensor GRAB-Ado, we identified a striatal extracellular adenosine tone that was elevated by the ENT1 inhibitor and sensitive to gliotoxin fluorocitrate. Finally, we identified that ethanol (50 mM) promoted A1R-mediated inhibition of dopamine release, through diminishing adenosine uptake via ENT1. Together, these data reveal that dopamine output dynamics are gated by a striatal adenosine tone, limiting amplitude but promoting contrast, regulated by ENT1, and promoted by ethanol.

To delineate how MSCs recognize and respond differently to both force types, we compared effects of dynamic (200 cycles x 2%) and static (1 × 2% hold) strain on nuclear translocation of β-catenin and YAP1 at 3h after force application. Dynamic strain induced nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, and increased cytoskeletal actin structure and cell stiffness, but had no effect on nuclear YAP1 levels. Critically, both nuclear actin and nuclear stiffness increased along with dynamic strain-induced β-catenin transport. Augmentation of cytoskeletal structure using either static strain or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) did not increase nuclear content of β–catenin or actin, but induced robust nuclear increase in YAP1.

From our data a likely transmembrane topology can be inferred for the ACT helices constituting the translocation and the hydrophobic regions. From this topology a simple and plausible mechanism emerges by which ACT could translocate its AC domain into target cells, challenging previous views in the field. Blocking the ACT-cholesterol interactions might thus be an effective approach for inhibiting ACT toxicity on cells, and this could help in mitigating the severity of pertussis disease in humans.</p>",2021-11-26

Neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation are relevant neurological features of DS reaching to early development of Alzheimer’s disease. Preclinical evidence suggests that the endocannabinoid system, an important neuromodulator on cognition and neuroinflammation, could act as beneficial target in DS. Indeed, cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) activity was enhanced in the hippocampus of young-adult trisomic Ts65Dn mice, a well-characterized surrogate model of DS. In previous studies, inhibition of CB1R, was able to restore key neurological deficits in this mouse model. To determine the possible clinical relevance of this target, it is mandatory to evaluate the long-term consequences of attenuated CB1R activity and to minimize the possible side-effects associated to this mechanism. We found that CB1R expression was significantly enhanced in the hippocampus brains of aged DS subjects. Similarly, middle-aged trisomic mice showed enhanced CB1R expression. Long-term oral administration of a low dose of the CB1R specific antagonist rimonabant was administered to male and female Ts65Dn trisomic and wild-type mice from the time of weaning to 10 months, an age when signs of neurodegeneration have been described in the model. CB1R inhibition resulted in significant cognitive improvement in novel object-recognition memory in trisomic male and female mice, reaching a similar performance to that of wild-type littermates. Interestingly, this long-term rimonabant treatment modify locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, body weight or survival rates. Brain analysis at 10 months of age revealed noradrenergic and cholinergic neurodegeneration signs in trisomic mice that were not modified by the treatment, although the alterations in hippocampal microglia morphology shown by vehicle-treated trisomic mice was normalized in trisomic mice exposed to rimonabant. Altogether, our results demonstrate a sustained pro-cognitive effect of CB1R inhibition at doses that do not produce major side effects that could be associated to an anti-inflammatory action, suggesting a potential interest in this target of to preserve cognitive functionality in DS.</p>",2021-11-22

IFN-beta stimulation enhanced frequencies of expressing cells for all pSTATs. Correlations among several pSTATs, particularly pSTAT1(S727)high and pSTAT3(S727)high were observed. While polarization resulted in increases in canonically associated pSTATs, other non-canonical pSTAT changes were also observed.

We find that matrix proteolysis is linked to the formation of wide strands, but has little effect on the maximum extent of invasion. Cell-cell junctions also favour wide strands, but our analysis also reveals a requirement for cell-cell junctions for efficient invasion in response to uniform directional cues. Unexpectedly, the ability to generate wide invasive strands is coupled to the ability to grow effectively when surrounded by ECM in 3D assays. Combinatorial perturbation of both matrix proteolysis and cell-cell adhesion demonstrates that the most aggressive cancer behaviour, both in terms of invasion and growth, is achieved at high levels of cell-cell adhesion and high levels of proteolysis. Contrary to expectation, cells with canonical mesenchymal traits – no cell-cell junctions and high proteolysis – exhibit reduced growth and lymph node metastasis. Thus, we conclude that the ability of squamous cell carcinoma cells to invade effectively is also linked to their ability to generate space for proliferation in confined contexts.

All preterm infants had perinatal or/and perinatal risk factors for brain damage.  EEG was obtained during phase II of natural NREM sleep.

Resting heart rate (RHR) is an important biomarker of morbidities and mortality, but no universally accepted definition nor measurement criteria exist. In this study, we provide a working definition of RHR and describe a method for measurement of RHR recorded using PPG derived from wristband measurement across a 24-hour cycle.
<bold>Methods:</bold> 433 healthy subjects wore a wrist device that measured activity and HR for up to 3 months. HR during inactivity was recorded and the duration of inactivity needed for HR to stabilise was ascertained. We identified the lowest HR during each 24-hour cycle (true RHR) and examined the time of day or night this occurred. The variation of HR during inactivity through the 24-hour cycle was also assessed. The sample was also subdivided according to daily activity levels for subset analysis. 
<bold>Findings:</bold> Adequate data was obtained for 19,242 days and 18,520 nights. HR stabilised in most subjects after 4 minutes of inactivity. Mean (SD) RHR for the sample was 54.5 (8.0) bpm (day) and 50.5 (7.6) bpm (night). RHR values were highest in the least active group (lowest MET quartile) . A circadian variation of HR during inactivity was confirmed, with the lowest values being between 0300 and 0700 hours for most subjects.
<bold>Interpretation:</bold> RHR measured using a PPG-based wrist-worn device is significantly lower at night than in the day, and a circadian rhythm of HR during inactivity was confirmed.  Since RHR is such an important health metric, clarity on the definition and measurement methodology used is important. A minimum rest time of 4 minutes provides a reliable measurement of HR during inactivity and true RHR in a 24-hour cycle is best measured between 0300 and 0700 hours.

Compared to other hues, particularly strong gamma oscillations have been reported for red stimuli. However, precortical color processing and the resultant strength of input to V1 has often not been fully controlled for. This leaves the possibility that stronger responses to some hues were due to differences in V1 input strength. We presented stimuli that had equal luminance and color contrast levels in a color coordinate system based on color responses of the lateral geniculate nucleus, the main input source for area V1. With these stimuli, we recorded magnetoencephalography in 30 human subjects. We found narrowband color-induced gamma oscillations in early visual cortex, which, contrary to previous reports, did not differ between red and green stimuli of equal L-M cone contrast. Notably, blue stimuli with contrast exclusively on the S-cone axis induced very weak gamma responses, as well as smaller event-related fields and poorer change detection performance. The strength of human color gamma responses could be well explained by the strength of thalamic input induced by each hue and does not show a clear red bias when this input strength is properly equalized.</p>",2021-11-22

Reduced spine density, activated microglia phenotype and impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) were observed in wild-type mice after LPS injection, whereas hIL-37tg mice showed no impairment. In addition, we crossed the hIL-37tg mouse with an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (APP/PS1) to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-37 under chronic neuroinflammatory conditions. Our results show that IL-37 is able to limit inflammation in the brain after acute inflammatory events and prevent the loss of cognitive abilities in a mouse model of AD.</p>",2021-11-26

Correlation with histology from the same brain enables a thorough validation of the structures identified with MAP-MRI. Moreover, anatomical details that are evident in images of MAP-MRI parameters are not visible in conventional T1-weighted images. We also derived subcortical template “SC21” from segmented MRI slices in three-dimensions and registered this volume to a previously published anatomical template with cortical parcellation (Reveley et al., 2017; Saleem and Logothetis, 2012), thereby integrating the 3D segmentation of both cortical and subcortical regions into the same volume. This newly updated three-dimensional D99 digital brain atlas (V2.0) is intended for use as a reference standard for macaque neuroanatomical, functional, and connectional imaging studies, involving both cortical and subcortical targets.

This study introduces a novel computational framework, based on the concept of fine-tuning (Hinton, 2007), for modeling differences in interpretation of narratives based on the listeners’ perspective (i.e. their prior knowledge, thoughts, and beliefs). We draw on an fMRI experiment conducted by Yeshurun et al.

We collected a dedicated dataset of ~3000 stories, and used it to create two modified (fine-tuned) versions of a pre-trained DLM, each representing the perspective of a different group of listeners. Information extracted from each of the two fine-tuned models was better fitted with neural responses of the corresponding group of listeners. Furthermore, we show that the degree of difference between the listeners’ interpretation of the story - as measured both neurally and behaviorally - can be approximated using the distances between the representations of the story extracted from these two fine-tuned models. These models-brain associations were expressed in many language-related brain areas, as well as in several higher-order areas related to the default-mode and the mentalizing networks, therefore implying that computational fine-tuning reliably captures relevant aspects of human language comprehension across different levels of cognitive processing.</p>",2021-11-23

The larger C-terminal fragment of NS3 polypeptide contains helicase activity. In the present study, we discovered that ZIKV NS2BNS3pro efficiently binds single-stranded (ss) RNA (Kd ~0.3 uM), suggesting that the protease may have a novel function. We tested an array of NS2B-NS3pro modifications and found that NS2B NS3pro constructs that adopt the recently discovered super-open conformation could not bind ssRNA. Likewise, stabilization of NS2B-NS3pro in the closed (proteolytically active) conformation by substrate-like inhibitors abolished ssRNA binding. Therefore, we suggest that ssRNA binding occurs when ZIKV protease adopts the open conformation, which could be modeled using dengue NS2B-NS3pro in the open conformation. ssRNA binding competes with ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro protease activity, likely by shifting the complex into the open conformation. Modeling of ZIKV NS3 helicase activity based on homologous crystal structures suggests that the open conformation of NS3pro domains provides a positively charged surface contiguous with the NS3 helicase domain. Such a positively charged surface is well poised to bind ssRNA, providing an explanation for the previously observed requirement of NS3pro for RNA processivity by viral helicase. Our structure-function analyses suggest that binding of ssRNA by the protease domain of NS3 is likely to be a universal feature of Flaviviridae, given the high level of homology between NS3 protease-helicase proteins in this family.</p>",2021-11-28

We assemble 129-residue-long tau K18 chains at atomic resolution from an extensive fragment library constructed with molecular dynamics simulations. We introduce a reweighted hierarchical chain growth (RHCG) algorithm that integrates experimental data reporting on the local structure into the assembly process in a systematic manner. By combining Bayesian ensemble refinement with importance sampling, we obtain well-defined ensembles and overcome the problem of exponentially varying weights in the integrative modeling of long-chain polymeric molecules. The resulting tau K18 ensembles capture nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shift and J-coupling measurements. Without further fitting, we achieve excellent agreement with measurements of NMR residual dipolar couplings. The good agreement with experimental measures of global structures such as singlemolecule Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiencies is improved further by ensemble refinement. By comparing wild-type and mutant ensembles, we show that pathogenic single-point P301 mutations shift the population from the turn-like conformations of the functional microtubule-bound state to the extended conformations of disease-associated tau fibrils.

We found underlying mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired mitophagy, and reduced IMT in MSCs derived from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice (MSC-Ob). Mechanistically, MSC-Ob failed to sequester their damaged mitochondria into LC3-dependent autophagosomes due to decrease in mitochondrial cardiolipin content, which we propose as a putative mitophagy receptor for LC3 in MSCs. Functionally, MSC-Ob exhibited diminished potential to rescue metabolic deficits and cell death in stress-induced epithelial cells. In a small molecule screen, we found pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) as a regulator of mitophagy and IMT. Long-term culture of MSC-Ob with PQQ (MSC-ObPQQ) restored cardiolipin content and sequestration of mitochondria to autophagosomes with concomitant activation of mitophagy. Upon co-culture, MSC-ObPQQ rescued cell death in stress-induced epithelial cells by enhancing IMT. The beneficial effect of PQQ was also evident in MSCs derived from human subjects in an in vitro model. In two independent mice models, the transplantation of MSC-ObPQQ restored IMT to airway epithelial cells, improved their mitochondrial metabolism and attenuated features of allergic airway inflammation (AAI).

Pre-onset and disease onset timepoints were chosen based on longitudinal electroencephalography (EEG) that revealed a gradual increase in theta power between 10- and 18-weeks after prion injection, resembling a clinical feature of human PrD. At disease onset, marked by significantly increased theta power and histopathological lesions, mice had pronounced translatome changes in all five cell types despite having a normal outward appearance. Remarkably, at a pre-onset stage, prior to EEG and neuropathological changes, we found that 1) translatomes of astrocytes indicated a sharply reduced synthesis of ribosomal and mitochondrial components, 2) excitatory neurons showed increased expression of cytoskeletal genes, and 3) inhibitory neurons revealed reduced expression of circadian rhythm network genes. Further assessment for the role of circadian rhythms using a jet lag paradigm modestly exacerbated disease.

SeV has long been utilized as a model paramyxovirus and has recently gained attention as a viral vector candidate for both laboratory and clinical applications. To infect host cells, SeV must first bind to sialic-acid glycolipid or glycoprotein receptors on the host cell surface via its hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein. Receptor binding induces a conformational change in HN, which allosterically triggers the viral fusion (F) protein to catalyze membrane fusion. While it is known that SeV binds to α2,3-linked sialic acid receptors, and there has been some study into the chemical requirements of those receptors, key mechanistic features of SeV binding remain unknown, in part because traditional approaches often convolve binding and fusion. Here, we develop and employ a fluorescence microscopy-based assay to observe SeV binding to supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) at the single particle level, which easily disentangles binding from fusion. Using this assay, we investigate mechanistic questions of SeV binding. We identify chemical structural features of ganglioside receptors that influence viral binding and demonstrate that binding is cooperative with respect to receptor density. We measure the characteristic decay time of unbinding and provide evidence supporting a “rolling” mechanism of viral mobility following receptor binding. We also study the dependence of binding on target cholesterol concentration.

The question then arises as to whether this observation also applies to proprioceptive targets which are hidden from sight, and rarely, if ever, viewed. We used an established technique for pinpointing the type of body representation used for the spatial encoding of targets which consisted of assessing the effect of peripheral gaze fixation on the pointing accuracy. More precisely, an exteroceptive, visually dependent, body representation is thought to be used if gaze deviation induces a deviation of the pointing movement. Three light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were positioned at the participants’ eye level at −25 deg, 0 deg and +25 deg with respect to the cyclopean eye. Without moving the head, the participant fixated the lit LED before the experimenter indicated one of the three target head positions: topmost point of the head (vertex) and two other points located at the front and back of the head. These targets were either verbal-cued or tactile-cued. The goal of the subjects (n=27) was to reach the target with their index finger. We analysed the accuracy of the movements directed to the topmost point of the head, which is a well-defined, yet out of view anatomical point. Based on the possibility of the brain to create visual representations of the body areas that remain out of view, we hypothesized that the position of the vertex is encoded using an exteroceptive body representation, both when verbally or tactile-cued. Results revealed that the pointing errors were biased in the opposite direction of gaze fixation for both verbal-cued and tactile-cued targets, suggesting the use of a vision-dependent exteroceptive body representation. The enhancement of the visual body representations by sensorimotor processes was suggested by the greater pointing accuracy when the vertex was identified by tactile stimulation compared to verbal instruction. Moreover, we found in a control condition that participants were more accurate in indicating the position of their own vertex than the vertex of other people. This result supports the idea that sensorimotor experiences increase the spatial resolution of the exteroceptive body representation. Together, our results suggest that the position of rarely viewed body parts are spatially encoded by an exteroceptive body representation and that non-visual sensorimotor processes are involved in the constructing of this representation.</p>",2021-11-23

To spread across a population, these drives require that disrupted alleles be largely recessive so as not to impose too high of a fitness penalty. We argue that this restriction may be relaxed by using a double gene drive design to spread a split binary expression system. One drive carries a dominant lethal/toxic effector alone and the other a transactivator factor, without which the effector will not act. Only after the drives reach sufficiently high frequencies would individuals have the chance to inherit both system components and the effector be expressed.

Stroop and the WCST test assess selective attention and cognitive flexibility in shifting between rules, respectively. Thirty-two healthy adults were included in two experimental conditions (control and treatment) in random order, separated by at least seven days. Standing balance was evaluated by the Sway Medical Mobile application in eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) in different stance positions: feet apart, feet together, semi-tandem, tandem, and single-leg stance (SLS). Balance was evaluated before and after the cognitive test in each experimental condition. Our findings indicate that performing cognitively demanding tasks adversely affected the balance ability in more demanding balance tests such as the SLS with EC (P □ 0.05). However, no significant changes were seen in other balance tests (P □ 0.05). Additionally, no significant changes were seen in balance ability after the Stroop or Wisconsin card sorting test alone. These results confirm that performing cognitively demanding tasks significantly reduced the ability to keep balance in less stable conditions.

The seedling dry weight, germination time and other germination parameters also showed similar improvements. Comparatively, the three growth stimulators showed no major variations in their ability to improve germination percentage under microgravitational impact.

Morales'}, {'name': 'Serena Di Santo'}, {'name': 'Miguel A. Muñoz'}]","<p>The brain is in a state of perpetual reverberant neural activity, even in the absence of specific tasks or stimuli. Shedding light on the origin and functional significance of such activity is essential to understanding how the brain transmits, processes, and stores information. An inspiring, albeit controversial, conjecture proposes that some statistical characteristics of empirically observed neuronal activity can be understood by assuming that brain networks operate in a dynamical regime near the edge of a phase transition. Moreover, the resulting critical behavior, with its concomitant scale invariance, is assumed to carry crucial functional advantages. Here, we present a data-driven analysis based on simultaneous high-throughput recordings of the activity of thousands of individual neurons in various regions of the mouse brain. To analyze these data, we construct a unified theoretical framework that synergistically combines cutting-edge methods for the study of brain activity (such as a phenomenological renormalization group approach and techniques that infer the general dynamical state of a neural population), while designing complementary tools. This unified approach allows us to uncover strong signatures of scale invariance that is “quasi-universal” across brain regions and reveal that these areas operate, to a greater or lesser extent, at the edge of instability. Furthermore, this framework allows us to distinguish between quasi-universal background activity and non-universal input-related activity. Taken together, the following study provides strong evidence that brain networks actually operate in a critical regime which, among other functional advantages, provides them with a scale-invariant substrate of activity in which optimal input representations can be sustained.</p>",2021-11-23

However, generating high-quality aptamers with sufficient affinity and specificity for biomedical applications is a challenging feat for most research laboratories. In this <italic>Account</italic>, we describe four techniques developed in our lab to accelerate the discovery of high quality aptamer reagents that can achieve robust binding even for challenging molecular targets. The first method is particle display, in which we convert solution-phase aptamers into aptamer particles that can be screened via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to quantitatively isolate individual aptamer particles based on their affinity. This enables the efficient isolation of high-affinity aptamers in fewer selection rounds than conventional methods, thereby minimizing selection biases and reducing the emergence of artifacts in the final aptamer pool. We subsequently developed the multi-parametric particle display (MPPD) method, which employs two-color FACS to isolate aptamer particles based on both affinity and specificity, yielding aptamers that exhibit excellent target binding even in complex matrices like serum. The third method is a click chemistry-based particle display (click-PD) that enables the generation and high-throughput screening of “non-nattural” aptamers with a wide range of base modifications. We have shown that these base-modified aptamers can achieve robust affinity and specificity for targets that have proven challenging or inaccessible with natural nucleotide-based aptamer libraries. Lastly, we describe the non-natural aptamer array (N2A2) platform, in which a modified benchtop sequencing instrument is used to characterize base-modified aptamers in a massively parallel fashion, enabling the efficient identification of molecules with excellent affinity and specificity for their targets. This system first generates aptamer clusters on the flow-cell surface that incorporate alkyne-modified nucleobases, and then performs a click reaction to couple those nucleobases to an azide-modified chemical moiety. This yields a sequence-defined array of tens of millions of base-modified sequences, which can then be characterized in a high-throughput fashion. Collectively, we believe that these advancements are helping to make aptamer technology more accessible, efficient, and robust, thereby enabling the use of these affinity reagents for a wider range of molecular recognition and detection-based applications.</p></sec>",2021-11-24

Particularly attractive would be methods that can use remote-controlled boats for sampling because it would allow for cost-effective, and frequent monitoring at multiple sites. The latter will be particularly important for tropical reservoirs that require year-around surveillance. We here optimize molecular protocols for capturing reservoir-specific differences in metazoan communities based on small water volumes (15 mL). The optimization is based on samples from two freshwater reservoirs with very different water qualities (“reservoir signal”). Each reservoir was sampled at three sites (“biological replicates”). For each water sample, the DNA was extracted twice (“technical replicates”). We then tested how much DNA template (0.1 ng to 15 ng) and how many PCR cycles (25 or 35) minimized variance between technical replicates. We find that 15 mL is sufficient for capturing the reservoir signal regardless of sampling time, template amounts, or PCR cycle numbers. Indeed, extrapolation from our results suggests that &lt;1 mL would be sufficient because only 17 of 59 metazoan mOTUs (mainly planktonic crustaceans and rotifers) detected with a 313bp COI minibarcode were shared. We find that the use of 35 PCR cycles significantly lowered the number of detected species and that template amounts &lt;0.5 ng yielded somewhat higher variance between technical replicates. Despite extensive trials, the variance between technical replicates remained high (Bray-Curtis: 5–20%; Jaccard: 10–40%) and we predict that it will be difficult to reduce this variance further. However, the overall reservoir differences are so strong that all biological and technical replicates can be correctly assigned.</p>",2021-11-24

Parab'}, {'name': 'Krystin Eaton'}, {'name': 'Myron Hinsdale'}, {'name': 'Laura-Isobel McCall'}]","<p>The influenza virus (IAV) is a major cause of respiratory disease, with significant infection increases in pandemic years. Vaccines are a mainstay of IAV prevention, but are complicated by consideration of IAV’s vast strain diversity, manufacturing and vaccine uptake limitations. While antivirals may be used for treatment of IAV, they are most effective in early stages of the infection and several virus strains have become drug resistant. Therefore, there is a need for advances in IAV treatment, especially host-directed, personalized therapeutics.Given the spatial dynamics of IAV infection and the relationship between viral spatial distribution and disease severity, a spatial approach is necessary to expand our understanding of IAV pathogenesis. We used spatial metabolomics to address this issue. Spatial metabolomics combines liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of metabolites extracted from systematic organ sections, 3D models and computational techniques, to develop spatial models of metabolite location and their role in organ function and disease pathogenesis. In this project, we analyzed plasma and systematically sectioned lung tissue samples from uninfected or infected mice. Spatial mapping of sites of metabolic perturbations revealed significantly lower metabolic perturbation in the trachea compared to other lung tissue sites. Using random forest machine learning, we identified metabolites that responded differently in each lung position based on infection, including specific amino acids, lipids and lipid-like molecules, and nucleosides. These results support the implementation of spatial metabolomics to understand metabolic changes upon IAV infection and to identify candidate pathways to be targeted for IAV therapeutics.</p><sec><title>Importance</title><p>The influenza virus is a major health concern. Over 1 billion people become infected annually despite the wide distribution of vaccines, and antiviral agents are insufficient to address current clinical needs. In this study, we used spatial metabolomics to understand changes in the lung and plasma metabolome of mice infected with influenza A virus, compared to uninfected controls. We determined metabolites altered by infection in specific lung tissue sites and distinguished metabolites perturbed by infection between lung tissue and plasma samples. Our findings highlight the importance of a spatial approach to understanding the intersection between lung metabolome, viral infection and disease severity. Ultimately, this approach will expand our understanding of respiratory disease pathogenesis and guide the development of novel host-directed therapeutics.</p></sec>",2021-11-23
