Evidence suggests that the virus is evolving to allow efficient spread through the human population, including vaccinated individuals. Here we report a study of viral variants from surveillance of the Delaware Valley, including the city of Philadelphia, and variants infecting vaccinated subjects. We sequenced and analyzed complete viral genomes from 2621 surveillance samples from March 2020 to September 2021 and compared them to genome sequences from 159 vaccine breakthroughs. In the early spring of 2020, all detected variants were of the B.1 and closely related lineages. A mixture of lineages followed, notably including B.1.243 followed by B.1.1.7 (alpha), with other lineages present at lower levels. Later isolations were dominated by B.1.617.2 (delta) and other delta lineages; delta was the exclusive variant present by the last time sampled. To investigate whether any variants appeared preferentially in vaccine breakthroughs, we devised a model based on Bayesian autoregressive moving average logistic multinomial regression to allow rigorous comparison. This revealed that B.1.617.2 (delta) showed three-fold enrichment in vaccine breakthrough cases (odds ratio of 3; 95% credible interval 0.89-11). Viral point substitutions could also be associated with vaccine breakthroughs, notably the N501Y substitution found in the alpha, beta and gamma variants (odds ratio 2.04; 95% credible interval of 1.25-3.18).

However, how can a relevant map be selected in situations where a stimulus is embedded in multiple relational structures? Here, we find that both spatial and temporal cognitive maps influence generalization in a choice task, where spatial location determines reward magnitude. Mirroring behavior, the hippocampus not only builds a map of spatial relationships but also encodes temporal distances. As the task progresses, participants' choices become more influenced by spatial relationships, reflected in a strengthening of the spatial and a weakening of the temporal map. This change is driven by orbitofrontal cortex, which represents the evidence that an observed outcome is generated from the spatial rather than the temporal map and updates hippocampal representations accordingly. Taken together, this demonstrates how hippocampal cognitive maps are used and updated flexibly for inference.</p>",2021-10-23

One common mechanism is adaptive introgression, which has received increasing attention as a potential route to rapid adaptation in populations struggling in the face of ecological change, particularly global climate change. However, hybridization can also result in deleterious genetic interactions that may limit the benefits of adaptive introgression. Here, we used a combination of genome-wide quantitative trait locus mapping and differential gene expression analyses between the swordtail fish species Xiphophorus malinche and X. birchmanni to study the consequences of hybridization on thermotolerance. While these two species are adapted to different thermal environments, we document a complicated architecture of thermotolerance in hybrids. We identify a region of the genome that contributes to reduced thermotolerance in individuals heterozygous for X. malinche and X. birchmanni ancestry, as well as widespread misexpression in hybrids of genes that respond to thermal stress in the parental species, particularly in the circadian clock pathway. We also show that a previously mapped hybrid incompatibility between X. malinche and X. birchmanni contributes to reduced thermotolerance in hybrids.

Currently, pregnant women are screened in the last month of pregnancy and GBS-positive women are given antibiotics during parturition to prevent bacterial transmission to the neonate. Recently, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) isolated from breastmilk were found to inhibit GBS growth and biofilm formation in vitro, and women that make certain HMOs are less likely to be vaginally colonized with GBS. Using in vitro human vaginal epithelial cells and a murine vaginal colonization model, we tested the impact of HMO treatment on GBS burdens and the composition of the endogenous microbiota by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. HMO treatment reduced GBS vaginal burdens in vivo with minimal alterations to the vaginal microbiota. HMOs displayed potent inhibitory activity against GBS in vitro, but HMO pretreatment did not alter adherence of GBS or the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus to human vaginal epithelial cells. Additionally, disruption of a putative GBS glycosyltransferase (Δsan_0913) rendered the bacterium largely resistant to HMO inhibition in vitro and in vivo but did not compromise its adherence, colonization, or biofilm formation in the absence of HMOs.

The virus gains access to host cells when the viral Spike protein (S-protein) binds to the host cell-surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Studies have attempted to understand SARS-CoV-2 S-protein interaction with vertebrate orthologs of ACE2 by expressing ACE2 orthologs in mammalian cells and measuring viral infection or S- protein binding. Often these cells only transiently express ACE2 proteins and levels of ACE2 at the cell surface are not quantified. Here, we describe a cell-based assay that uses stably transfected cells expressing ACE2 proteins in a bi-cistronic vector with an easy to quantify reporter protein to normalize ACE2 expression. We found that both binding of the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and infection with a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus is proportional to the amount of human ACE2 expressed at the cell surface, which can be inferred by quantifying the level of reporter protein, Thy1.1. We also compared different ACE2 orthologs which were expressed in stably transfected cells expressing equivalent levels of Thy1.1. When ranked for either viral infectivity or RBD binding, mouse ACE2 had a weak to undetectable affinity for S-protein while human ACE2 was the highest level detected and feline ACE2 had an intermediate phenotype. The generation of stably transfected cells whose ACE2 level can be normalized for cross-ortholog comparisons allows us to create a reusable cellular library useful for measuring emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant’s ability to potentially infect different animals.</p>",2021-10-23

Due to their position on the glomerular capillaries, podocytes are exposed to near-constant biomechanical force, which can fluctuate widely. These include shear stress and hydrostatic pressure. A pathological increase in these forces can induce morphological change to podocytes, their detachment from the glomerular basement membrane and subsequent loss into the primary urine. The ability to sense and respond to variations in mechanical force would be beneficial to a cell exposed to these conditions. It is likely podocytes have such mechanisms, however their identity are unknown. Here we investigated the hypothesis that the mechanotransducer Piezo is involved in a mechanotransduction pathway in Drosophila nephrocytes, the podocyte homologue in the fly. We find Piezo is expressed in nephrocytes and localizes to the nephrocyte diaphragm. The Piezo agonist YODA, which stimulates channel opening in the absence of mechanical force, leads to a significant increase in intracellular Ca++ upon shear stress in the nephrocyte. This leads to activation of Rho1, delineating a putative Piezo mechanotransductive pathway in these cells. Loss of function analysis revealed minor defects in nephrocyte filtration function. In contrast, we show that elevated Piezo levels resulted in constantly oscillating Ca++ signals even in the absence of shear stress, increased active Rho1 and accumulation of actin stress fibers, culminating in a severe nephrocyte filtration phenotype, suggesting that pathway hyperactivity is detrimental. We asked if this phenotype could be reversed by blocking Piezo activity pharmacologically using the tarantula toxin GsMTx4. Treatment with GsMTx4 brought levels of activated Rho1 into the normal range. This work delineates a mechanotransductive pathway in nephrocytes involving Piezo, Ca++, Rho1 and the actin-cytoskeleton, and suggest this is part of a mechanism by which nephrocytes sense and adapt to changes in mechanical force.</p>",2021-10-23

The two amino acid polymorphisms of the Ta-sro1 proteoform enhance the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity of the protein suggesting that altered poly-ADP-ribosylation of unknown substrate proteins or nucleic acids underlie the elevated salinity tolerance of cultivar SR3.

Previous studies have shown that tree cover shows bimodal distributions for intermediate rainfall regimes in Africa and South America. In this study, we construct a vegetation state diagram by plotting vegetation cover as a function of mean annual rainfall for Northeast India, which is part of the Eastern Himalaya and the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot. We use remotely sensed satellite data of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as a proxy for vegetation cover. We obtain Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) from the CHIRPS data (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data). We find that EVI increases monotonically as a function of MAP in the range 1000-2000 mm, after which it plateaus. The 1000 to 2000 mm MAP corresponds to the vegetation transitional zone (1200-3700 m), whereas &gt;2000 MAP region covers the greater extent of the tropical forest (&lt;1200 m) of NEI. In other words, we find no evidence for bimodality in tree cover or vegetation states at coarser scales in North Eastern India.

While iPSC-PPC differentiation was asynchronous and included cell types from early to late developmental stages, we found that the predominant cell type consisted of NKX6-1+ progenitors. Genetic characterization using snATAC-seq identified 86,261 regulatory variants that either displayed chromatin allelic bias and/or were predicted to affect active transcription factor (TF) binding sites. Integration of these regulatory variants with 380 fine-mapped type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk loci identified regulatory variants in 209 of these loci that are functional in iPSC-PPC, either by affecting transcription factor binding or through association with allelic effects on chromatin accessibility.

This revealed that CREs vary substantially in their promoter compatibility, ranging from striking specificity for a single promoter to quantitative differences in activation across a broad set of promoters. More than half of the tested CREs exhibit significant promoter selectivity. Housekeeping promoters tend to have similar CRE preferences, but other promoters exhibit a wide diversity of compatibilities. Higher-order TF motif combinations may account for compatibility.

However, research on in vivo hippocampal activity dynamics has mostly relied on single modalities such as electrical recordings or optical imaging, with respectively limited spatial and temporal resolution. This technical difficulty greatly impedes multi-level investigations into network state-related changes in cellular activity. To overcome these limitations, we developed the E-Cannula integrating fully transparent graphene microelectrodes with imaging-cannula. The E-Cannula enables the simultaneous electrical recording and two-photon calcium imaging from the exact same population of neurons across an anatomically extended region of the mouse hippocampal CA1 stably across several days. These large-scale simultaneous optical and electrical recordings showed that local hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs) are associated with synchronous calcium events involving large neural populations in CA1. We show that SWRs exhibit spatiotemporal wave patterns along multiple axes in 2D space with different spatial extents (local or global) and temporal propagation modes (stationary or travelling). Notably, distinct SWR wave patterns were associated with, and decoded from, the selective recruitment of orthogonal CA1 cell assemblies. These results suggest that the diversity in the anatomical progression of SWRs may serve as a mechanism for the selective activation of the unique hippocampal cell assemblies extensively implicated in the encoding of distinct memories.

Design: Cross-sectional survey informed by the Framework for Culturally Competent Health Research conducted between March and July, 2021.

Setting: Participants were recruited from Greater Western Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

Participants: 708 community members who speak a language other than English at home participated (mean age: 45.4years [range 18 to 91]; 88% [n=622] born outside of Australia).

Outcome measures: Fifteen items regarding impacts of COVID-19, adapted from validated scales, previous surveys or co-designed in partnership with Multicultural Health and interpreter service staff. Logistic regression models (using post-stratification weighted frequencies) identified factors associated with psychological, social, and financial impacts. Surveys were available in English or translated (11 languages). 

Results: Even prior to the COVID-19 outbreak in Sydney, 25% of the sample reported feeling nervous or stressed most/all of the time and 22% felt lonely or alone most/all of the time. One quarter of participants reported negative impacts on their spousal relationships as a result of COVID-19 and most parents reported that their children were less active (64%), had more screen time (63%), and were finding school harder (45%). Mean financial burden was 2.9/5 (95%CI=2.8 to 2.9).

Based on the improvements we made previously (dicot codon optimized Cas9, tRNA for multiplexing, a modified sgRNA scaffold with high efficiency, CsU6 to drive sgRNA expression), we further improved our CRISPR/Cas9 system by choosing superior promoters (CmYLCV or CsUbi promoter) to drive Cas9 and optimizing culture temperature. This system was able to generate a biallelic mutation rate of up to 89% for Carrizo citrange and 79% for Hamlin sweet orange. Consequently, this system was used to generate canker resistant Hamlin sweet orange by mutating the effector binding element (EBE) of canker susceptibility gene <italic>CsLOB1</italic>, which is required for causing canker symptoms by <italic>Xcc</italic>. Six biallelic Hamlin sweet orange mutant lines in the EBE were generated. The biallelic mutants are resistant to <italic>Xcc</italic>. Biallelic mutation of the EBE region abolishes the induction of <italic>CsLOB1</italic> by <italic>Xcc</italic>. This study represents a significant improvement in sweet orange gene editing efficacy and generating disease resistant varieties via CRISPR-mediated genome editing. This improvement in citrus genome editing makes genetic studies and manipulations of sweet orange more feasible.</p>",2021-10-21

Microbial phylotypes are typically defined using a 97% small subunit (16S) rRNA threshold. However, increasing evidence has demonstrated the ubiquitous presence of taxonomic units of distinct functions within phylotypes. These so-called sequence-discrete populations (SDPs) have used to be mainly delineated by disjunct sequence similarity at the whole-genome level. However, gene markers that could accurately identify and quantify SDPs are lacking in microbial community studies. Here we developed a pipeline to screen single-copy protein-coding genes that could accurately characterize SDP diversity via amplicon sequencing of microbial communities. Fifteen candidate marker genes were evaluated using three criteria (extent of sequence divergence, phylogenetic accuracy, and conservation of primer regions) and the selected genes were subject to test the efficiency in differentiating SDPs within Gilliamella, a core honeybee gut microbial phylotype, as a proof-of-concept. The results showed that the 16S V4 region failed to report accurate SDP diversities due to low taxonomic resolution and changing copy numbers. In contrast, the single-copy genes recommended by our pipeline were able to successfully quantify Gilliamella SDPs for both mock samples and honeybee guts, with results highly consistent with those of metagenomics. The pipeline developed in this study is expected to identify single-copy protein coding genes capable of accurately quantifying diverse bacterial communities at the SDP level.</p>",2021-10-23

These activities rely on the ability of T4aP to dynamically extend and retract from the cell surface. Dynamic extension relies on a motor ATPase commonly called PilB. Most T4aP also rely on specific motor ATPases, commonly called PilT and PilU, to dynamically and forcefully retract. Here, we systematically assess whether motor ATPases from 4 distinct T4aP could functionally complement Vibrio cholerae mutants that lacked their endogenous motors. We found that the retraction ATPases PilT and PilU are highly promiscuous and promote retraction of the V. cholerae competence T4aP despite a high degree of sequence divergence. In contrast, orthologous extension ATPases were not able to mediate extension of the V. cholerae competence T4aP despite a similar degree of sequence divergence. Also, we show that one of the PilT orthologs characterized does not support PilU-dependent retraction and we attributed this loss of activity to the 3' end of the gene, which suggests that the C-terminus of PilT plays an important role in promoting PilU-dependent retraction. Together, our data suggest that retraction ATPases have maintained a high degree of promiscuity for promoting retraction of diverse T4aP, while extension ATPases have evolved to become highly specific for their cognate systems.</p>",2021-10-23

We found that lower bound of half life of the long-lived antibody secreting cells is 450 days. Moreover, our model predicts that the neutralizing antibody response could be more durable than suggested (up to 129 days for individuals with no requirement of supplemental oxygen and up to 175 days for others).

Translating human genetic findings (i.e., genome-wide association studies [GWAS]) to pathobiology and therapeutic discovery, however, remains a major challenge. To address this critical problem, we present a <underline><bold>net</bold></underline>work <underline><bold>t</bold></underline>opology-based deep learning framework to identify disease-<underline><bold>a</bold></underline>ssociated <underline><bold>g</bold></underline>enes (NETTAG).

Specifically, we leverage non-coding GWAS loci effects on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), histone-QTLs, and transcription factor binding-QTLs, enhancers and CpG islands, promoter regions, open chromatin, and promoter flanking regions. The key premises of NETTAG are that the disease risk genes exhibit distinct functional characteristics compared to non-risk genes and therefore can be distinguished by their aggregated genomic features under the human protein interactome. Applying NETTAG to the latest AD GWAS data, we identified 156 putative AD-risk genes (i.e., <italic>APOE</italic>, <italic>BIN1</italic>, <italic>GSK3B</italic>, <italic>MARK4</italic>, and <italic>PICALM</italic>). We showed that predicted risk genes are: 1) significantly enriched in AD-related pathobiological pathways, 2) more likely to be differentially expressed regarding transcriptome and proteome of AD brains, and 3) enriched in druggable targets with approved medicines (i.e., choline and ibudilast). In summary, our findings suggest that understanding of human pathobiology and therapeutic development could benefit from a network-based deep learning methodology that utilizes GWAS findings under the multimodal genomic analyses.</p>",2021-10-21

This variant is likely more infectious, attributed to mutation in the RBD of the spike protein T478K also seen in the alpha variant (B.1.1.7). However the time dynamics of the spread of this variant drastically changed upon the introduction of delta (B.1.617.2) to the country in which we observe a shift from 0% in May 2021 to 55% delta in the span of one month. Since the delta variant has dominantly spread across the globe, we investigated the increasing frequency of the Mexico variant, B.1.1.519, in the public community within Mexico City. Once present, the delta variant was 78% of the Mexico City catchment in July 2021, a time which marked the commencement of Mexico’s third wave. Our data supports the growing concern that the delta variant is closely associated with the massive infection spread of the VOC in Central and South America. While the T478K mutation, also seen in the alpha variant, has evidence for increased transmissibility, these data suggest that the delta variant shows overall increased fitness seeing as it outcompeted the B.1.1519 this Mexico community.</p>",2021-10-20

This study aimed to investigate and compare the efficacy of High-flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) with/without non-rebreather mask (NRM) on critical COVID-19 patients with/without diabetes. 
Materials and methods: For analysis and comparison, epidemiological, biochemical, and clinical data were collected from 240 HFNC±NRM treated severe and critical COVID-19 ICU patients (diabetic = 136; non-diabetic = 104) of five hospitals in Chattogram, Bangladesh. 
Results and Discussion: 59.1% patients with fever had diabetes (p=0.012). ICU stay was longer for diabetic patients (9.06±5.70) than non-diabetic ones (7.41±5.11) (p=0.020). Majority of hypertensive patients were diabetic (68.3%; p&lt;0.001). Most of the diabetic patients (70.4%; p&lt;0.005) had elevated creatinine levels. The partial pressure of oxygen after HFNC (only) was significantly (p=0.031) higher in non-diabetic patients (69.30±23.56) than diabetic ones (61.50±14.49). Diabetic (62.64±13.05) and non-diabetic patients (59.40±13.22) had similar partial pressure of oxygen from HFNC+NRM. Majority of the diabetic patients who required HFNC+NRM had elevated RBS (73.8%; p=0.001) and creatinine (75.7%; p=0.009). Factors affecting the HFNC only treated patients were fever and impaired glucose tolerance. Besides, increased plasma glucose level, age, and hypertension affected the HFNC + NRM treated diabetic patients.
Conclusion: The results of this study imply that oxygen supply with HFNC+NRM may be beneficial for the elderly/hypertensive diabetic patients with COVID-19 associated AHRF; and that IGT and increased blood glucose levels could be determinants for COVID-19 severity. However, further experiments to substantiate these claims are required on a larger sample and among different clinical cohorts.</p>",2021-10-18

ER-organelle tethering occurs in part through the interaction of the ER resident protein VAP with FFAT-motif containing proteins. FFAT motifs are characterized by a seven amino acidic core surrounded by acid tracks. We have previously shown that the human intracellular bacterial pathogen <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> establishes MCS between its vacuole (the inclusion) and the ER through expression of a bacterial tether, IncV, displaying molecular mimicry of eukaryotic FFAT motif cores. Here, we show that multiple layers of host cell kinase-mediated phosphorylation events govern the assembly of the IncV-VAP tethering complex. CK2-mediated phosphorylation of a C-terminal region of IncV enables IncV hyperphosphorylation of a phospho- FFAT motif core and serine-rich tracts immediately upstream of IncV FFAT motif cores. Phosphorylatable serine tracts, rather than genetically-encoded acidic tracts, accommodate Type III-mediated translocation of IncV to the inclusion membrane, while achieving full mimicry of FFAT motifs. Thus, regulatory components and post-translational modifications are integral to MCS biology, and intracellular pathogens such as <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> have evolved complex molecular mimicry of these eukaryotic features.</p>",2021-10-21
